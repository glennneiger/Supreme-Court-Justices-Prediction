            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 03-5165, Thornton against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.735" offset="26854">Here a Norfolk Virginia a police officer attempted to pull over petitioner, a guy name Marcus Thornton.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.743" offset="50887">Before the officer could stop petitioner however, he parked and exited his vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.983" offset="71889">The officer pulled in behind petitioner and accosted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.429" offset="85682">After discovering that he had narcotics on him, the officer arrested him and searched the passenger compartment of his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.444" offset="117760">Under the driver’s seat, the officer has found a handgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.071" offset="132284">Petitioner was charged with federal drug and firearms violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.245" offset="148898">The District Court denied his motion to suppress the firearm as a fruit of an illegal search relying among other cases on our opinion in New York against Belton.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.320" offset="189231">In Belton, we held that when a police officer makes a lawful custodial arrest of an automobile’s occupant, the Fourth Amendment allows the officer to search the vehicle’s passenger compartment as a contemporaneous incident to that arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.954" offset="251716">The petitioner appealed his conviction arguing that Bellton was limited to situations where the officer initiated contact with an arrestee while the arrestee, in this case petitioner, was still in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.362" offset="305424">The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.789" offset="311066">We granted certiorari and we now affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.681" offset="322664">In Belton, we sought to set forth a bright-line rule that would protect officer’s safety and preserve evidence for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.100" offset="352340">We place no reliance on whether the officer initiated the contact with the occupant of the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.220" offset="376790">In all relevant aspects, the arrest of a suspect who is next to a vehicle presents identical concerns regarding officer’s safety and the destruction of evidence as the arrest of one who is still inside the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.037" offset="432065">It would make little sense to apply two different rules to what is at bottom the same situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.141" offset="460487">We disagree with the petitioner that applying Belton’s rule to arrestees who are not confronted while they were inside the vehicle would diminish its clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.098" offset="496327">Belton explicitly applied to recent occupants of a car as well as occupant. A rule requiring officers to signal confrontation with occupants of vehicles would be inherently subjective, highly facts-specific, and would require precisely the sort of ad hoc determinations of the officers in the field and of reviewing courts that Belton sought to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.989" offset="595905">The judgment of the Court of Appeals was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.825" offset="607295">Justice O’Connor has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment in which Justice Ginsburg has joined; Justice Stevens has filed a disssenting opinion in which Justice Souter has joined.</text>
