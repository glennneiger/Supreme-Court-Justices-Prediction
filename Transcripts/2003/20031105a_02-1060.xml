            <text syncTime="11.146" offset="44513">A Lombard informational checkpoint was designed to find witnesses to a specific known crime.</text>

Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="54.613" offset="218384">The Court held in Edmond that crime control checkpoints are not subject to a balancing analysis, but rather are per se invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.137" offset="252447">The Illinois Supreme Court in this case held that informational checkpoints, including the Lombard checkpoint here, fall within that general crime control exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.541" offset="13258083">Here we have far less than the drug interdiction that was rejected in Edmond.</text>

            <text syncTime="3322.464" offset="13289848">We have far less than the concern about protecting our national borders, as we had in Martinez v. Fuerte, and certainly not the imminency of the hazard that was found in Sitz.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.891" offset="13339481">There's frankly no empirical or actual data to even support that this roadblock will advance the interest, and by the fact that nothing was advanced in this particular event suggests that even in a balancing test we don't have the sufficiency, the gravity of the public concern, nor do we have any indication of any degree to which this seizure would advance the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.130" offset="13432477">This is more akin to Prouse, where the Court found that the...  the likelihood of finding an unlicenced motorist versus the likely numbers of persons that will be stopped was so substantial that data was insufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="3375.880" offset="13503425">However, the effectiveness was mentioned as...  as one of the factors, and there were certainly reasonable alternatives that were suggested that could have avoided the random stop scenario.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.338" offset="13557342">And here we have admittedly innocent drivers as well with no escape route, so a person couldn't even avoid the...  the compulsory stop and questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.258" offset="13608960">I would also submit that this analysis, if...  if found appropriate here, would equally allow for the stop of pedestrians at...  on the sidewalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.055" offset="13660160">It would allow the police to circle an office building and have the persons run through the...  with the gamut of brief questioning before they were allowed to leave an office building.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.194" offset="13708748">And it would be very unmanageable and unworkable to find an appropriate balancing test, even though I would submit that one thing the Court needs to do is to, of course, let law enforcement know in advance what will be acceptable conduct on their part and that it would be inappropriate to allow for a case-by-case, fact-sensitive analysis based on the plethora of crimes that could potentially lead to it, the geographic area in a small rural town.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.768" offset="13843017">The rural police chief may find roadblocks or...  may find their most serious crime to be the stealing of a purse and therefore a roadblock of some form justifiable there, where that same roadblock in an urban setting would be found to be unreasonable and unjustifiable, and certainly those politically accountable officials that feel that their citizenry are more favorable to roadblocks may be encouraged to allow them to occur more often.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary Feinerman</label>
            <text syncTime="3497.122" offset="13988467">This Court in Edmond found that narcotics check...  narcotics checkpoints are so obnoxious to core Fourth Amendment values that a per se rule of invalidity was justified and the principal question here is whether informational checkpoints present the same Fourth Amendment dangers that general crime control checkpoints present, and the answer to that is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.475" offset="14085851">And in order to answer that, we...  we have to figure out what the hallmarks are of a crime control checkpoint, and we suggest that there are at least two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.020" offset="14120020">The first is that it's the purpose of the checkpoint to incriminate the motorist as opposed to the situation in Lombard, which was simply the police asking for help, and that distinction makes a difference under the Fourth Amendment for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.561" offset="14174145">The first has to do with privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.624" offset="14182400">At a general crime control checkpoint, the police are trying to learn something about you, whether you've committed a wrongdoing, whereas at an informational checkpoint there's just asking for help, somebody died here last week, could you help us find the perpetrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.453" offset="14237780">There's also a difference in terms of jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.932" offset="14247706">At a general crime control checkpoint you may be interrogated, detained, arrested, prosecuted, and possibly jailed, whereas at an informational checkpoint, again, you're just being asked for help, and that's a critical distinction that this Court drew in Ferguson between the drug test that was invalidated in Ferguson and the drug testing programs that were upheld in Skinner, Acton, and Von Raab.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.626" offset="14342478">There's also an indignity element to a general crime control checkpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.206" offset="14360764">You're being...  it's...  it's a bit of an indignity to be suspected as being a potential law-breaker, whereas in...  in an informational checkpoint there's really no impingement on dignity, you're just, again, being treated as an ally of the police and being asked for help, and in fact, it's an act of responsible citizenship to provide help in that kind of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.383" offset="14445505">The second distinction is that a general crime control checkpoint...  the police are simply trolling for hitherto undiscovered crimes, whereas in an informational checkpoint, they're investigating a known, specific crime, and that's who makes a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.781" offset="14507050">There's a difference between...  as Ms. Millett pointed out...  there's a difference between knowing a crime and finding the criminal and then simply rounding up a bunch of potential criminals and trying to peg a crime on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.215" offset="14552816">And that's important not only for the fact that we're uncomfortable with general...  general surveillance, but also it's a traditional police function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.215" offset="14588761">When a crime happens, police ought to return to the scene of the crime and find witnesses.</text>
