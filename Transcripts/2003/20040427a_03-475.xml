            <text syncTime="3409.311" offset="13637172">Now, the Court of Appeals didn't refine that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.284" offset="13645113">It said that, well, that's pretty broad, and it should be narrowed down, but it should be whatever is necessary to prove their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.880" offset="13679491">They thought what was necessary to prove their case was to have all outside contacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.322" offset="13697254">FACA does not require the production of that degree or that scope of documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.236" offset="13720869">It has to do with minutes and drafts and things that were actually considered by the committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="3449.620" offset="13798400">And one was what non-Federal offices participated, and two, to what extent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3512.583" offset="14050325">So... and there is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.007" offset="14064013">Now, with respect to the subordinate working groups, a point was made with respect to the President's directive, that the President said the Vice President may establish subordinate working groups to assist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.734" offset="14118870">The declaration that's in the file at page 240 of the Joint Appendix specifically says that the Vice President authorized that, but the Vice President did not establish any such subordinate working groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.434" offset="14169652">And then the declaration goes on to say that there was only a public citizen that was involved in developing graphics and that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.637" offset="14198491">And that was the only person that was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.330" offset="14205283">No such individuals, the individuals named in the litigation, participated in the working group formulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.224" offset="14236839">What we are saying here is that the constitutional immunity from discovery that we are talking about here is rooted in the overriding presumption of regularity, which, if repealed in this case, would repeal... if overridden in this case would repeal the exemption under FACA for all government working groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.759" offset="14322939">And these are exclusive functions, textually committed to the President of the United States getting opinions from his subordinates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.127" offset="14356480">As your question suggested, Justice Breyer, virtually anything that the President might do, asking the Attorney General or the Assistant Attorney General for this or that to formulate something, and they go out to talk to people, that could be a... that would be a FACA lawsuit in a heartbeat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.255" offset="14420950">There is no statute that creates the right that the Petitioners seek here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.451" offset="14441744">There is no, there is no cause of action under FACA, and there is, no, Justice Stevens, no clear remedy, no clear right to which they are entitled to ministerial duty and therefore a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.387" offset="14493466">And they just jumped over the fact that the statute didn't give them the right to bring this case and brought it in the form of mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.342" offset="14525336">Mandamus is no substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.325" offset="14533277">It's not appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.595" offset="14538292">It's a pure circumvention of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.016" offset="14548010">There is, we submit, no such thing as a de facto member of an advisory group under FACA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.991" offset="14575909">FACA was intended to address the creation of de jure working groups where the President would cloak himself in the benefit of public citizens who have come up with this proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.710" offset="14618749">It's not, I think your question, Justice Breyer, it's not a FOIA case.</text>
