            <text syncTime="3577.810" offset="14398276">Prior to this case, Virginia has never taken the position that it has any authority to take any kind of regulatory action at all with respect to piers and wharfs beyond the water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.555" offset="14441221">And in fact, what Virginia has done is it has sent hundreds of its citizens to Maryland and it has told its citizens that their construction projects from the Virginia side of the Potomac River fall outside of Virginia's jurisdiction but fall within Maryland's because Maryland owns the bed of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.439" offset="14508722">That ownership gives Maryland the right, putting aside just for the moment any agreements... it gives Maryland the right to regulate withdrawals of water from Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.717" offset="14553861">And so what we're left with at this moment is article VI, the fourth paragraph, of the Black-Jenkins Award, and it says it does give Virginia full dominion over the right in the soil, but Justice Scalia, I would disagree it gives Virginia any sovereign rights to use the river beyond that point because if it gave Virginia the unrestricted right to use the Potomac River beyond that point, that's called quiet title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.800" offset="14650201">That means Virginia gets to do what it wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.972" offset="14658873">Maryland can't regulate it, and this Court said in Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe that that kind of regulatory action, if unrestricted, is the equivalent of a quiet title action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.185" offset="14699729">The Black-Jenkins arbitrators rejected Virginia's claim to any title to the middle of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.417" offset="14720627">They set Virginia's boundary at low-water mark on the Virginia side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.167" offset="14735673">They could have done the boundary line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.056" offset="14747167">They could have drawn it around the piers and wharfs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.915" offset="14754691">They showed an unbelievable dexterity in drawing the boundary through Smith Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.397" offset="14772558">They went from the bottom of the Chesapeake Bay up through the bottom third of Smith Island and back down again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.066" offset="14795233">They didn't do that on the Virginia side of the Potomac.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.471" offset="14804846">They set low-water mark on Virginia's side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.877" offset="14814459">Title to... Virginia has title to low-water mark, but only a right of use beyond that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.360" offset="14836402">It has not an unrestricted right of use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.046" offset="14843193">The right of us is subject to governmental authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.498" offset="14856986">The government that gets to regulate it is the government that owns it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.982" offset="14866913">Thank you.</text>
