            <text syncTime="2860.036" offset="11440065">And the... the Federal court decisions, other than Bridges, reject that point of view.</text>

            <text syncTime="2879.316" offset="11517179">And the Federal judges removed the case to Federal court, and the county said, well, the Tax Injunction Act applies here because the Federal judges are going to raise State tax issues and this Federal court will be deciding cases having to do with State tax administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.868" offset="11583425">And they cited the Kelleher case out of the Second Circuit which it held that the Tax Injunction Act was so broad that it applied to tax... all State tax administration.</text>
