            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">The second case I have to announce is No. 02-1580, Vieth versus Jubelirer.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.462" offset="37825">This case comes to us on appeal from a three-judge District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.159" offset="68545">The population figures derived from the 2000 Census showed that Pennsylvania was entitled to two fewer representatives in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.992" offset="103967">Pennsylvania’s republican controlled general assembly drew up a new district in plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.785" offset="127060">The appellants here sued to enjoin the plan’s implementation alleging, among other things, that it constituted a political gerrymander in violation of Article I and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.947" offset="183693">A political gerrymander refers to according to one definition, the practice of dividing a geographical area into electoral districts often of highly irregular shape to give one political party an unfair advantage by diluting the opposition’s voting strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.403" offset="265509">Consistent with that definition, the plaintiffs alleged that the Pennsylvania plans districts were “meandering and irregular” ignored all traditional redistricting criteria including the preservation of local government boundaries solely for the sake of partisan’s advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.415" offset="337607">The District Court composed of three judges dismissed the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.973" offset="355892">We affirm that dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.458" offset="365819">What I now set forth is a summary of the views of a plurality of the Court consisting of the Chief Justice, Justice O’Connor, Justice Thomas, and me.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.685" offset="406674">Political gerrymanders are not new.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.430" offset="413675">They existed in colonial times and continued through the framing.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.200" offset="432797">Eighteen years ago in a case called Davis versus Bandemer, this Court got into the business of policing misfield rejecting the contention that political gerrymandering claims are non-justiciable, insusceptible of judicial resolution because there are no judicially discernible and manageable standards to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.177" offset="512627">Six justices in Bandemer concluded that there were judicially discernible and manageable standards but could not agree on what those standards might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.629" offset="558498">Four believed one thing, two believed something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.937" offset="571664">The lower courts have lived with that assurance of a standard coupled with that inability to specify one for the past 18 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.369" offset="605414">Abesnt a majority prescribed standard they have employed the standard enunciated by Bandemer’s four justice plurality.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.861" offset="635402">Its application has almost invariably produced the same result as would have obtained if the question was non-justiciable, that is to say judicial intervention has been refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.517" offset="685976">18 years of considerable judicial effort with virtually nothing to show for it justify, we think, reconsideration of the question whether the standard promised by Bandemer in fact exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.505" offset="733936">Those of us joining the plurality opinion conclude that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.569" offset="746266">All of the standards that have been proposed to date are unmanageable, indiscernible, or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.706" offset="770821">The basic problem is that some degree of political motivation and effect in districting is not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.646" offset="798511">No one contents that a decent amount of political motivation and political effect is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.977" offset="827873">So, it comes down to determining how much political motivation and effect is too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.371" offset="849398">We find it impossible to craft the standard that is clear enough and enough rooted in constitutional imperatives to render judicial entry into this political field appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.261" offset="892970">Our opinion discusses all the standards that have been proposed up to now.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.773" offset="911047">In the interest of time I will summarize here only our remarks concerning the appellant’s proposed standard since that illustrates the practical difficulties inherent in all the proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.335" offset="961306">Appellants would first require a plaintiff to show that the map makers acted with a predominant intent to achieve partisan advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.135" offset="1000490">We have used a predominant intent standard in our racial gerrymandering cases under the Voting Rights Act, but its application in that very different context provides no comfort here.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.794" offset="1055138">To begin with, it has been used there only to assess challenges to particular districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.753" offset="1078962">Whereas appellants, would apply it statewide.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.410" offset="1093590">Vague as a predominant motivation test might be when used to evaluate single districts, it all but evaporates when applied statewide.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.352" offset="1129326">Does it mean, for instance, that partisan intent must outweigh all other goals that the plan pursues contiguity, compactness, preservation of neighborhood, etcetera statewide?</text>
            <text syncTime="296.792" offset="1187109">Even Within a narrower compasses of challenges to a single district moreover applying a predominant intent test to racial gerrymandering is easier and less disruptive unlike political gerrymandering, a decent amount of which, as I said, is okay, segregating voters on the basis of race is unlawful and is much more rarely encountered.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.758" offset="1290971">Determining whether the shape of a particular district is so substantially affected by the presence of a rare and constitutionally suspect motive as to invalidated is quite different from determining whether it is so substantially affected by the excess of an ordinary unlawful motive as to invalidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.184" offset="1372682">The second problem the appellant’s proposed standard would require a plaintiff to show one, that the district's systematically packed and cracked the rival party’s voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.780" offset="1411030">Those are election campaign terms for compressing the voters of the other party into one district packing them and cracking them, dispersing them all in order to achieve electoral advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.366" offset="1465365">So, you have to show one that they systematically pack and crack, and two, that the map can thwart the plaintiff’s ability to translate a majority of votes into a majority of seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.507" offset="1529940">Again, our application of somewhat similar standards to assess racial discrimination claims under the Voting Rights Act does not establish that this standard will take root in political soil.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.364" offset="1573407">A person’s politics is rarely as readily discernible and never as permanently discernible as a person’s race. Political affiliation is not an immutable characteristic, but may shift from one election to the next.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.025" offset="1632026">And even within a given election, not all voters follow the party line.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.280" offset="1649058">We dare say and hope that the political party which puts forward an utterly incompetent candidate will lose even in its registration stronghold.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.518" offset="1686047">These facts make it impossible to assess the effects of parson gerrymandering the fashion of standard for evaluating a violation and finally to craft a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.007" offset="1735993">Appellants urged that their standard is limited and thereby manageable because it would only target those gerrymanders that thwart the plaintiff’s ability to translate a majority of votes into a majority of seats.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.758" offset="1786984">To begin with, it is unclear how that standard has any relevance to a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.106" offset="1812376">It rests upon the principle that groups have a right to proportional representation, but the constitution guarantees equal protection of the law to persons, not equal representation in government to equivalently sized groups of which they are innumerable numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.472" offset="1877786">Even assuming its relevance, the standard is unmanageable because the judiciary lacks a reliable means to assess majority party status in the fluid world of political affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.024" offset="1928046">Appellants would have us look to vote totals in statewide races to assess partisan support, but as shown by the facts of this very case, where republicans won three and democrats won two of the five-statewide offices at issue, statewide races can be utterly uninformative.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.715" offset="2014772">And what is true at the statewide level may not be true at the district level.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.095" offset="2032327">We decline to assume that the only factor determining voting behavior is political affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.351" offset="2061375">Bandemer promised the existence of a standard that is both manageable and discernible, that is suggested by some constitutional requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.540" offset="2094080">18 years have proven that prognostication false.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.759" offset="2111007">We have no reason to be optimistic as to the emergence of a standard in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.665" offset="2130651">Pessimism is validated by today’s opinions in which the four dissenting justices produce three more proposed standards, all of them different from the two suggested in Bandemer, and all of them either unmanageable or indiscernible for reasons we described in our opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.569" offset="2194181">We conclude that Bandemer erred in holding that political gerrymandering claims are justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.273" offset="2221035">Stare decisis does not require that Bandemer be allowed to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.638" offset="2238485">Stare decisis claims are at their weakest with respect to a decision interpreting the constitution particularly where there has been no reliance on that decision as there could not conceivably had been any reliance on Bandemer.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.931" offset="2291670">We would therefor, overrule Bandemer and affirm the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.205" offset="2312777">Justice Kennedy has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment and this forms the fifth vote necessary for our disposition of affirmance.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.418" offset="2345587">He recognizes that there are no existing manageable standards for measuring whether a political gerrymander burdens the representational rights of a party’s voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.602" offset="2386338">Justice Kennedy would however limit his disposition to the case before us recognizing that the outcome might be different in a case where a suitable standard could be found.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="582.725" stopTime="774.827">
            <label>Justice Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="582.725" offset="2330854">Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Ginsburg; Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion, and I have also filed a dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.743" offset="2370873">I shall make just three brief points: the first, neither Justice Scalia's plurality opinion, nor Justice Kennedy’s opinion concurring in the judgment, contains a single kind word about political gerrymandering.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.711" offset="2430746">Partisan gerrymandering like the English rotten borough enables representatives to choose their constituents rather than vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.747" offset="2466900">It is an invidious, undemocratic, and unconstitutional practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.204" offset="2488738">Although the plurality would rely on the political process to curtail this undemocratic process, five members of the Court agree that claims of this kind are justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.864" offset="2535445">The Constitution does not require the fox to guard the hen house.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.689" offset="2554671">Second, a reference to history, when I was in law school in Illinois in 1946, a statute enacted over four decades earlier still define the boundaries of congressional districts in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.482" offset="2633874">A suburban district with a population of 112000 had the same representatives as an urban district with 900000 residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.578" offset="2674312">It was in a case rejecting a constitutional challenge to that undemocratic allocation on justiciability grounds that Justice Frankfurter used his famous metaphor cautioning the judiciary to stay out of the political picket.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.871" offset="2735438">Fortunately, that metaphor did not carry the day when our leader decisions in Baker against Carr and Reynolds against Sims paved the path to our one person one vote jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.762" offset="2782981">I am confident that the Frankfurter like reasoning in today’s plurality opinion will eventually meet the same fate.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.871" offset="2815478">Finally, as a response to the plurality’s professed inability to identify judicially manageable standards to apply in political gerrymandering cases, I need only find out that the same standards that the majority fashioned to reject the racial gerrymanders adapted to mitigate past injustices to minority voters could also be applied in political gerrymandering cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.363" offset="2925401">After all racial gerrymandering is merely one species of political gerrymandering.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.413" offset="2949642">Moreover, as the written dissent demonstrates, other manageable standards are clearly available and presumably will be applied in future cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.224" offset="2988826">In sum, I am confident that in time, today’s decision will receive the same respectful treatment as Justice Frankfurter’s famous metaphor.</text>
