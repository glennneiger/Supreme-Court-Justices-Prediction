            <text syncTime="14.489" offset="57887">This case presents a single question: Can the deadline for objecting to a bankruptcy discharge be altered by equitable exceptions?</text>
            <text syncTime="25.346" offset="101355">To answer that question, we start with the language of the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.919" offset="123611">Bankruptcy Rule 4004 states that an objection to discharge must be filed no later than 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.610" offset="166348">This rule also allows for an extension of the time, but only by motion and only if that motion is filed, quote, before the time expires.</text>

            <text syncTime="54.985" offset="219847">Mr. Poor, may I suggest that the question you have raised is not the one that I understood this case to involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.810" offset="259239">It's not whether the provision allows for equitable exceptions, it's whether you forfeited that claim, the claim that it does not... whether you forfeited it by letting the thing go past your answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.984" offset="327889">You didn't raise it in your answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.303" offset="333113">You let the case go off on summary judgment on the merits and remained silent until after there was an adverse judgment against you.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.188" offset="364669">So at least in my thinking, the forfeiture question, whether you forfeited, the argument that you would now like us to treat as the question presented, that is the threshold question.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.121" offset="1212395">There's a provision in the rules for a deadline for making a claim, but perhaps as in a statute of limitations case, it's not an extension of time to find a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.302" offset="1277179">It's... it's a different concept, and maybe should be viewed much like a waiver of a statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.332" offset="1353247">This is different because here the language of the 60 days is modified or altered by Bankruptcy Rule 4... 9006(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="350.759" offset="1402984">The rulemakers didn't stop with the 60-day deadline.</text>

            <text syncTime="404.546" offset="1618129">In the language here, if you take the plain language of 4004 and 9006(b), that plain language simply does not allow for any type of equitable exceptions, whether they're deemed to be waiver or forfeiture or if--</text>

            <text syncTime="438.620" offset="1754384">This one is different for this reason, that the presumption here is that when the drafters adopted 9006, what they did was they patterned it after Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b), almost... almost virtually identically, and the language of 6(b), on which 9006(b) is patterned, has had a long history of being... had an established meaning as setting jurisdictional deadlines and... for its own subgroup of rules, and those rules, as this Court held in the Robinson case, we must presume that rules that are based on that 6(b) rule are presumed to be... to have the same meaning, that is, in the words of the Robinson case, as mandatory and jurisdictional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2177.696" offset="8710687">I... I happen to believe that dischargeability is a complaint for objecting to dischargeability primarily affects the objecting party and the debtor, and while there may be other rights of people implicated, it's still very personal with respect to the debtor and the creditor who's making the objection to discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.150" offset="8808594">And that would also be even more true with respect to dischargeability of particular debts as in 4007.</text>

            <text syncTime="2679.679" offset="10718668">The rules-based answer is alluded to by respondent, which is the Rule 4004(d) expressly incorporates through Part 7 of the bankruptcy code the pleading requirements of 8(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.926" offset="10783660">Now, that means that the... the debtor has an obligation to plead his affirmative defenses at the answer or they would be treated as waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.943" offset="10819709">This was an affirmative defense, and so just by applying the rules it was subject to waiver when it was not raised in the answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3171.237" offset="12684852">Can you just give me one word about whether my belief about the Rule 6... it refers to a new trial motion in a civil case, motion to amend the opinion, JNOV, all those time limits it says are absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.351" offset="12761339">Now, I take it it's never been held or isn't at least normally held that a lawyer can sit there, notice that the time limits weren't complied with, wait to see if he wins, and then if he loses, bring it up for the first time on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.855" offset="12823406">Am I right about that?</text>

I can imagine that there's a case out there that says something along the following, that this Court's jurisdiction, by statute, is based on the requirement, for example, that there be a notice of appeal filed within 30 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="3257.330" offset="13029251">I'd like to return to the... the fundamental point is when these were adopted, 9006(b) was patterned after 6(b), and that identical language, as this Court instructed in the Robinson case, should be read to be mandatory and jurisdictional, that is, not waiveable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.079" offset="13136248">And if we look at a case like Santos, there's nothing in the language that allows Santos to pick and choose between... between saying equitable estoppel would... would not apply but waiver would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.651" offset="13194553">The only possible way you can get there in Santos is not through the text, not through the language, which Robinson has told us is mandatory and jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.106" offset="13232379">The only way you can get there is through the... a policy argument that says, we think it's a good idea not to have equitable estoppel, but on the other hand, yeah, for policy reasons, we... we should allow waiver to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.425" offset="13309597">And if you allow waiver, whether it is waiver in the implied sense of inaction or waiver in the express sense of allowing a stipulation, in that case, you will have really taken what is in the text and these are no longer jurisdictional rules without exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.063" offset="13392248">Rather, they have become rules that the parties themselves may change, and this deadline has never been like a statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.973" offset="13431850">It has always been different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.869" offset="13439373">It allows the parties to, before there's any... before there's any adjudication, any deadline, to take discovery and move the deadline along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.098" offset="13484304">That's not like a typical statute of limitation, and the reason for that is the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.587" offset="13506247">The text says it may only be extended to the extent and under the conditions stated, the exact language that was at issue in Carlisle and in Robinson, and we would submit that you have to read the same language in the same way, whether it's 9006(b), 6(b), Criminal Rule 45(b), they all are based on the same language.</text>
