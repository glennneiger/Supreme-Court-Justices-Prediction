            <text syncTime="70.217" offset="280764">The argument instead is made by analogy, as Your Honor referred, to the... the admiralty case of Deep Sea Research, but the Deep Sea Research case is limited to the admiralty context.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.220" offset="332800">It's limited to the special aspects of admiralty law that had developed over hundreds of years, certainly 200 years of... of our Nation's experience.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.042" offset="792137">And I understand, but just on the basic point of whether or not just for a discharge of a debt, the State can be bound, you say you think it might be plausible, but the State would be bound by the judgment if it later sues on the debt.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.924" offset="1815615">Well, could it be adjudicated without an adversary proceeding, just say the debtor comes in and says, I'm giving notice to the State?</text>

            <text syncTime="2669.510" offset="10678021">--That's... that's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.659" offset="10702576">Of course, this Court could rule that given the traditional in rem nature of a bankruptcy and the fact that, particularly under the Bankruptcy Act a preference, as Chief Justice Rehnquist pointed out, was not part of the bankruptcy summary jurisdiction but required a plenary action, that in fact actions requiring any affirmative monetary relief against a State are not part of a debtor's... are not part of a bankruptcy court's in rem jurisdiction, if it chose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2723.130" offset="10892434">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.625" offset="10902465">The State's position in this case is that a proceeding under the law which requires the State to make a choice between voluntarily entering the proceeding or sitting back and suffering a loss of its... of its rights is every bit as coercive whether it's styled as a motion or an adversary proceeding or... or anything else, is every bit as coercive as a lawsuit similar to the... the situation with the administrative proceedings in the Federal Maritime Commission case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2754.420" offset="11017613">Is that loss of its right automatic?</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.535" offset="11022106">What is your answer to the question of whether, if you don't show up, a default judgment is entered automatically against you, or does the bankruptcy judge have to make the assessment of whether there's an undue hardship?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daryl J. Brand</label>
            <text syncTime="2766.270" offset="11065051">I am not certain, Your Honor, but I believe that an undue hardship showing would still be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.478" offset="11081874">But in either... in either situation, the State would suffer the consequences of losing its rights subject to an adjudication, not subject to the mere operation of law as with the general discharge at the conclusion of a... of an ordinary bankruptcy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.728" offset="11142896">As... as far as the preference actions go, this case... I'm sorry... this Court decided in Hoffman v. Connecticut which involved a preference action and even more than that, a turnover action where there actually was property of the estate that the... that the bankrupt trustee was... was entitled to recover, that in either of those types of situations, the Eleventh Amendment applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.231" offset="11240908">Now, of course, that case turned on whether Congress had... had made a clear statement in the statute, but in any event, the Court, having found that the... that the Congress did not make a clear statement of intent to override sovereign immunity, applied the Eleventh Amendment to that preference action, that turnover action in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.518" offset="11314051">Now, in this case we have no property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.203" offset="11324709">The... the debtor is not seeking to... to get property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.258" offset="11336934">The... the creditor is not seeking to make a claim out of the property of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.512" offset="11353966">So we would submit that... that the Court can decide this case, which involves a simple adversary proceeding on its face, the issuance of compulsory process without even reaching the question of whether a similar effect would... would occur in... in a preference action or in any other type of bankruptcy action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.407" offset="11433587">So I'd like to emphasize to the Court that this is an unusual statute, and the question in this case is, does the Eleventh Amendment apply in the bankruptcy context?</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.355" offset="11473398">But the precise circumstances of this case can well limit a court's holding to the question of whether sovereign immunity protects the State in an adversary proceeding on this particular type of statute for a particular exception from discharge.</text>
