            <text syncTime="62.953" offset="251716">The Confrontation Clause prohibited the admission of the accomplice's custodial statement here for two reasons: first, because its interlocking nature did not establish its reliability under this Court's Roberts jurisprudence; and second, and more fundamentally, because the accomplice's custodial statement amounted to out-of-court testimony that was never submitted to cross-examination, in violation of the traditional understanding of the right to confrontation.</text>

            <text syncTime="120.500" offset="481907">And the... and the common understanding of that term is to give a statement that you understand is going to be used in a criminal investigation, and when you're giving a statement to the authorities, here a custodial statement to the police, that's a different situation than the ordinary, everyday occurrence of speaking to a friend or a colleague or something.</text>

            <text syncTime="1495.565" offset="5982250">It involves having a witness who's under oath, who is subject to cross-examination, who's demeanor can be observed by the jury, and who is brought face to face with the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.165" offset="6028643">Now, this Court has held in a number of cases that all or some of those components of confrontation may be dispensed with when, in the necessities of the case and in order to obtain witness... witnesses who will be able to testify at the trial, it is required to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.915" offset="6099592">For example, in the instance of former testimony, you have oath, cross... and cross-examination, and you have at one point the defendant face to face with the witness, but you do not have the important confrontation right of the jury having the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.824" offset="6175242">And the Court held that that is required because the necessities of the case require overcoming what would otherwise be a confrontation right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.779" offset="6211082">Similarly in Maryland v. Craig, the Court held that the literal face-to-face right to confront the witness may be overcome by the necessities of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1958.910" offset="7835585">And we also acknowledge that the Court would have to develop a jurisprudence to decide what testimonial statements means, if the Court adopts the testimonial approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.934" offset="7879680">What we do submit is that the way in which the word witness against is used in the Sixth Amendment, particularly when read in light of the way the word witness is used in the Fifth Amendment and also in the Sixth Amendment's Compulsory Process Clause, that the word witness was meant to refer to people who were giving evidence for purposes of a case, not to people who simply happen to observe facts in the world and made statements about them and that are now being used as hearsay in a criminal trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2022.978" offset="8091899">What exists today is a body of law that has examined the indicia of reliability question, and with respect to certain statements in the testimonial category, such as victim statements to the police in a condition that might be likened to an excited utterance or sometimes in statements in aid of medical diagnosis or treatment, and also true statements against penal interests such as guilty pleas by a defendant that does not implicate the defendant on trial but simply acknowledges criminal conduct, the lower courts have concluded that those statements do have sufficient indicia of reliability to be admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.442" offset="8249678">And our concern is that if this Court were to adopt the testimonial approach, that it not do so in a way that would foreclose lower courts from taking advantage of evidence that is reliable, unavailable from another source, important in criminal prosecutions and well-grounded in the theory of the Confrontation Clause as a vehicle for achieving truth in criminal trials.</text>

            <text syncTime="2124.197" offset="8496692">But sometimes a defendant who pleads guilty is still awaiting sentencing, and as this Court held in Mitchell v. United States, the defendant still has a Fifth Amendment privilege and can refuse to testify on grounds of privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.489" offset="8549878">Other defendants who plead guilty in their own cases will sometimes refuse to testify even on pain of contempt, and at that point the choice for the judicial system is either admitting that's... that evidence in the criminal trial or excluding it altogether and risking a manifest failure of justice because there isn't the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3434.184" offset="13736647">It doesn't address problems concerning witnesses that become unavailable through no fault of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.910" offset="13763605">Yet, why should society suffer to have a criminal defendant released simply because a witness has become unavailable?</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.597" offset="13790354">And you know, you can't always prove a defendant has made a witness unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.850" offset="13807386">That is a really tough standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.541" offset="13814073">There are similar other cases where particularly young witnesses, who are perfectly capable of telling you exactly what happened to them or what they've seen in a nonconfrontational setting, but yet, because of either fear or intimidation, they are simply unable to come into court and testify in front of a bunch of strangers or in... probably in front of the very person who is alleged to have victimized them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.374" offset="13921489">They're not going to be able to say a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.481" offset="13929848">Yet, there needs to be some way to get what they can say in front of a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.259" offset="13952940">I... I think that any system that prohibits that is just going to be contrary to the interests of society in general and to the interests of the other parties that... that are involved in the trial other than the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.862" offset="14015425">And if there are no further questions, thank you very much.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="3510.838" offset="14043324">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.203" offset="14048758">I think it's important to concentrate in rebuttal on the State's suggestion and the Solicitor General's suggestion to retain the reliability prong of the Roberts framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.920" offset="14079582">The Solicitor General agrees with us that the history of the... that... that you ought to be looking to history here, and the history on this point is crystal clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.176" offset="14112601">From Rex v.... Rex v. Paine in 1696, other English cases before the Constitution, and then this Court's cases after the Constitution was adopted, principally Kirby and Mattox, and all the way through Douglas, the... when the situation arose that a witness was unavailable, the rule was clear if the... if... if the statement was testimonial, given to the authorities, it had to be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.985" offset="14211866">And it's not... and the... and the balance was struck by the Framers not... not just because of these public policy considerations, but because of the Framers were insisting upon an adversarial method of giving testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.638" offset="14254498">And when the Framers decided, when that was not present, that we were simply not prepared to... to admit the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.325" offset="14281247">And so what we have is we have a clear rule until at least the 1970's that reliability doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.588" offset="14310296">And the only time reliability... first was adopted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.304" offset="14325133">The only time it became important was in Dutton v. Evans when you had a non-testimonial statement, and then in Roberts when this Court created a general framework that it allowed reliability, all of a sudden, be into play when we were stretching the Confrontation Clause in our view too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.710" offset="14382811">But once you bring the Confrontation Clause back to the proper scope, as we're asking you to do and the Solicitor General is asking you to do, there's really no reason anymore to... to keep the reliability prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.939" offset="14427742">The reliability prong was... was adopted by this Court to deal with the problem of hearsay that was coming outside the testimonial type setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.515" offset="14465985">Once you... once you read it... read that problem away, we're back to the original understanding of the Confrontation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.542" offset="14490122">And the reason that you ought to stick with that... Justice Ginsburg I think put the nail on the head when she said the reason we're here today is that you have a... you... you have... what you have now is a system where trial judges can reach almost any conclusion they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.885" offset="14539442">That's shown in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.372" offset="14545398">The Solicitor General doesn't even describe to you how reliability... doesn't even defend reliability findings in light of all the briefing by... by the petitioner and by amici.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.198" offset="14584790">And so I think that when you look at that, you show that the very concern that gave rise to Raleigh trial... and I would say parenthetically that I believe Lord Cobham was unavailable in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.351" offset="14625332">That's what the transcript says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.465" offset="14629825">And the very problem was that trial judges could do these reliability determinations in place of... of a clear rule of when testimony could be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.375" offset="14669427">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
