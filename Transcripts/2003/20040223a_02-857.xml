            <text syncTime="12.715" offset="50782">This case involves a regulation promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board to govern the disclosure of fees imposed for exceeding a credit limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.457" offset="89757">It does not involve any challenge to the fees themselves or any contention that the fees were not disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.343" offset="121313">Unquestionably they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.421" offset="129672">This case concerns only how such fees should be characterized when they are disclosed.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="38.516" offset="154018">Would you enlighten us on just how this transaction gets authorized in the ordinary course of events and in this event?</text>
            <text syncTime="48.009" offset="191948">Is there any special call made, or is the credit card just submitted to the store and the store processes it and if it's not rejected, it goes through?</text>
            <text syncTime="60.558" offset="242207">What happens?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="61.838" stopTime="228.158">
            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="61.838" offset="247327">Well, as the Solicitor General has explained in his brief for the Federal Reserve Board, ordinarily the arrangement between banks... that is, the banks that issue the cards and the banks that do the corresponding relationship with the merchants... have an agreement between the merchants and the banks where the merchant will be liable for fraudulent use of the card or the other unless it obtains authorization to process the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.192" offset="380761">And so in the ordinary practice, the board has explained, a merchant may or may not, is not required to, but may well call in the charge or submit the account number to the issuing bank via the correspondent bank and get an approval, yes or no, to process the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.536" offset="466129">Now, the board has explained that when the issuing bank authorizes the merchant to process the charge, that two important things don't happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.431" offset="509701">One, it does not in any way represent a renegotiation between the consumer and the issuing bank, and it says nothing about the overall credit limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.031" offset="556095">And two, the issuing bank often will have no idea whether the charge being authorized will or will not trigger a credit limit of the consumer for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that, as the board explains, credits and payments aren't instantly reflected, merchants often don't put the true amount of the charge in.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.041" offset="676153">They may, as hotels and... and rental car companies do... often block very large amounts because they don't know what the ultimate charge will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.291" offset="713143">And there is also a recognition in the industry, the board explains, of a certain tolerance.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.311" offset="741146">That is, the merchant... the credit card company won't always want to cut somebody off whenever it has a suspicion that they may have hit their credit limit because the merchant has a relationship with the customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.200" offset="788793">And since the system of information is so imperfect, the issuing bank also has a relationship with its consumer and doesn't want to embarrass the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.974" offset="831843">So the short answer to that... the short version of the very long answer is in the ordinary course, merchants have an incentive to seek authorization, but they're not required to, and the authorization that's given doesn't reflect knowledge by the issuer that a credit limit will be exceeded.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="228.158" stopTime="248.508">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="228.158" offset="912614">But, Mr. Waxman, is it not true that there are many occasions on which the credit limit will, in fact, be exceeded and there will, nevertheless, come back an approval, and that the customer in those cases may or may not know that his... that, A, his limit was exceeded, and B, that he's going to be charged for it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="seth_p_waxman" startTime="248.508" stopTime="267.827">
            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="248.508" offset="994011">Well, the creditor... the consumer may or may not know that his or her credit limit was exceeded, but of course, that information is entirely within the knowledge of the... the potential knowledge of the consumer because the consumer does know what or... what charges he or she has made and what payments he or she has made.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="267.827" stopTime="284.917">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="267.827" offset="1071229">Well, not necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.365" offset="1073424">You can have a card owned by two or three people in the same family and maybe the husband spent some money that the wife didn't know about while this was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.744" offset="1106965">So it's at least possible that they would exceed the credit limit without the credit cardholder knowing it, their not being aware of it, not keeping track of it.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="285.289" offset="1141133">And... and I'm just asking you, is it not true that it is possible that he will receive an affirmative answer to using the card without knowing whether or not he exceeded the limit and therefore is going to be... be charged for it?</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="297.632" offset="1190452">--It's possible either because he doesn't keep good track or he doesn't... he's not accurate or he's allowed a child or a spouse to use the card and isn't keeping track or control of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.975" offset="1239876">But one thing that you said, Your Honor, that is not true is the issuing... the credit card issuer is not giving permission directly to the consumer to do anything, and most particularly if--</text>

            <text syncTime="325.579" offset="1302256">If the... if the credit card issuer is informed of the overcharge, that it's over the limit, and decides this is a good customer, well, let's not charge him for it or let's okay it anyway, he gives that information to the merchant and the merchant may not tell the customer anything about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1053.885" offset="4215536">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.194" offset="4244689">Congress has given the Federal Reserve Board broad authority to implement the Truth in Lending Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.517" offset="4266005">The regulation at issue here is the permissible exercise of that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.603" offset="4282410">The board has addressed the disclosure of fees for exceeding a credit limit with a clear bright line rule which requires all such fees to be disclosed clearly and conspicuously but separately from the finance charge and APR.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.259" offset="4341029">To use the Court's own terminology, that approach is neither obviously repugnant to the statute nor demonstrably irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.432" offset="4373629">To the contrary, the rule is a sensible one that, in the view of the expert agency, provides meaningful disclosure to consumers and clear guidance to creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.463" offset="4413753">There's no merit to the court of appeals' and respondent's contrary approach which would only impose exorbitant compliance costs on creditors without any meaningful benefit in terms of disclosure to consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.498" offset="4469969">The board's rule is not foreclosed by the statutory text.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.956" offset="4487732">The act does not speak expressly to whether over-the-limit fees are or are not finance charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.932" offset="4515631">Nor is that question resolved by the act's generally phrased definition of finance charges as charges imposed as an incident to the extension of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.417" offset="4557636">That phrase is ambiguous as to whether it encompasses charges that are imposed not as the cost of the credit that the creditor has contractually obligated itself to provide, but instead as a penalty for the consumer's obtaining some additional credit that she had no contractual right to obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.646" offset="4638511">The board's rule is rational.</text>

            <text syncTime="1250.341" offset="5001300">However, when a charge is, in fact, imposed by the creditor as a consequence of the consumer's exceeding the contractual credit limit, it is validly within this regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.087" offset="6292271">When the board revised Regulation Z in the 1980-81 period, after the TILA Simplification Act, the board sought to focus on legally enforceable relationships, not on unenforceable understandings that a consumer might have as a result of a course of dealings with the credit card company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.875" offset="6375445">And understanding this particular provision, consistent with its plain terms, as applying to all charges imposed or exceeding a credit limit is consistent with that approach.</text>

            <label>Mr. Seth P. Waxman</label>
            <text syncTime="3438.671" offset="13754619">The question of whether or not we disclosed this fee properly within the regulation was passed on by the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.386" offset="13805505">It is the law of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.872" offset="13811461">The lower court held, as the second part of its ruling, that, quote, unequivocally the regulation required us to disclose this fee as an other charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.275" offset="13853048">Now, Justice Scalia is correct that how you interpret the Fed's bright line regulation which says, at page 2 of our blue brief, the following charges are not finance charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.785" offset="13903099">Charges for exceeding a credit limit, of course, depends on what credit limit means, and credit limit is a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.618" offset="13938416">Everybody in the industry understands it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.235" offset="13948865">Even the respondent at page 1 of her brief, she says, quote, in the middle of the page, a credit limit represents the amount of credit the card issuer has preapproved the consumer to obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.510" offset="14001946">There's no possible allegation in this case that she ever asked for an extension of her credit limit or received an extension of her credit limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.672" offset="14046668">And there is a reason that the board came up with an absolute bright line rule, and the reason is that before 1980, when Congress mandated classifications in order to simplify things for creditors and consumers, the Federal Reserve Board confronted... confronted questions like many of the hypotheticals that Justice Stevens and others have asked here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.133" offset="14152516">Well, what if... what if they knew that it was going to exceed it and what if somebody actually called and asked permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.092" offset="14180310">I don't want to be embarrassed in the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.867" offset="14187416">Will you authorize this?</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.148" offset="14192536">The board literally... and some of... many of these letter interpretations are cited in the briefs in this case, although not all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.155" offset="14224614">The board drove itself crazy trying to answer all of these hypotheticals and came up with a set of letter rulings, exacerbated by the Federal courts also trying to come up with their own interpretations, that made it impossible for issuers to come up with formulaic disclosures that would prevent them from being socked with huge class action awards and allowed them to present information that consumers could compare.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.133" offset="14340493">And so Congress said in 1980 we want bright line classifications, and that's exactly what the board did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.563" offset="14370168">In 1980, the board said that it was amending its regulations to, quote, substitute where possible precise, easily applied rules for principles that create ambiguity and--</text>
