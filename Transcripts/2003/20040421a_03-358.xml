            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">We'll hear argument next in No. 03-358, the Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen.</text>

            <text syncTime="62.838" offset="251298">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="66.211" offset="264777">In February of 2001, an international arbitration panel, convened under the North American Free Trade Agreement, concluded that the United States' continuation of a blanket ban or a moratorium on the operation of Mexican domiciled commercial carriers beyond the border zone in the United States violated NAFTA.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.415" offset="349623">Soon thereafter, the President made clear... excuse me... his intention to comply with the arbitration decision by invoking power specifically vested in him by Congress to lift the moratorium in order to comply with an international trade agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.416" offset="413571">And the President in fact did lift the moratorium in November of 2002.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.860" offset="431438">In this case, the Ninth Circuit held that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, an agency in the Department of Transportation that is limited to a... a safety mandate, was required to conduct an elaborate and complex environmental analysis of the President's foreign trade and foreign policy decision before it could enter or issue procedural safety regulations that were necessary to implement the President's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.997" offset="543974">The Ninth Circuit set aside the procedural regulations on that ground and thereby prevented the agency from granting certification to carriers that under the President's decision were eligible to receive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.807" offset="595174">The Ninth Circuit's decision is incorrect and it has frustrated the President's ability to comply with NAFTA.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.941" offset="619729">Congress and the President, the two entities whose joint action brought about the lifting of the moratorium, are not subject to either NEPA or the provisions of the Clean Air Act that respondents rely on to require an environmental analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.251" offset="680960">Accordingly, the agency acted entirely reasonably in choosing to take the President's action as a given, including any increased traffic or trade that might occur as a result of the President's decision and to, instead, focus its own environmental analysis on the effects of its own procedural regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.127" offset="764447">FMCA's government... governing statute requires it to grant registration to any carrier that is willing and able to comply with applicable safety, safety fitness, and financial responsibility requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.538" offset="842083">The agency has no authority to deny operating permission to a carrier, foreign or domestic, based on environmental concerns or foreign trade concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.614" offset="882416">It has no authority to countermand the President's decision or to refuse to issue the regulations that were necessary to implement the President's decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.392" offset="921496">Mr. Kneedler, just a... a background fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.404" offset="929541">Perhaps I missed it, but was there any parallel in Canada?</text>
            <text syncTime="239.989" offset="959948">We're talking about Mexico or Mexican vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.501" offset="973949">I understood that originally there was the same limitation for both.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="249.054" stopTime="372.153">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="249.054" offset="996206">There was.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.435" offset="997669">And... and soon thereafter, the... the moratorium was imposed in 1982 originally, but it conferred on the President the power to lift the moratorium, and an agreement was arrived at soon thereafter with Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.105" offset="1052317">So since the early '80's, Canadian carriers have been... have been permitted to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.199" offset="1076767">The... the moratorium was remained in... retained in effect by the President through subsequent actions into the '90's.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.667" offset="1110622">In the North American Free Trade Agreement, the United States included a reservation to a complete opening of the border for transporter operations by carriers subject to a phase-out, initially a phase-out that would allow carriers from Mexico to operate in any of the border States... that was 3 years after the agreement was signed... and then by the year 2000, to allow the carriers to operate anywhere in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.546" offset="1222113">The President decided not to go forward with that because of concerns about whether the safety regulatory regime in Mexico was sufficient to prepare the Mexican carriers to come into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.405" offset="1277597">So that is the reason why it was held up.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.188" offset="1284702">And... and the basis of the NAFTA arbitration panel's decision was that a blanket prohibition on that ground was not... was... was not permissible under NAFTA and that the United States had to consider applications from Mexican carriers on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.699" offset="1354710">It could adopt special procedures to ensure that the carriers who would be permitted to come in under the President's lifting of the moratorium would satisfy the substantive safety standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.237" offset="1404865">And that is the set of regulations that are at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.419" offset="1417613">But it's important to recognize that these are not substantive safety standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.852" offset="1431406">The substance... the standards that... that Mexican carriers, like... like other foreign and domestic carriers in the United States have to comply with, are... have already been in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.710" offset="1470798">All that we are talking about here are essentially procedural or administrative regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="373.394" offset="1493473">Because I'm really kind of confused about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.186" offset="1500682">I'm trying to think through the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.267" offset="1509042">Assume the President wasn't involved at all and Congress had decided to lift the moratorium and enact it and did everything the President did and said, but before you do it, we want you to, as a precondition, adopt these safety regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.385" offset="1557525">Would your position be any different?</text>

            <text syncTime="3022.903" offset="12091559">The agency cannot keep out the old trucks for that reason alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.438" offset="12125727">My question is, does the agency have to prepare an impact statement saying we're letting in the old as well as the new, but in letting in the old, we're letting in more highly polluting trucks?</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.899" offset="12187585">Do they have to prepare that statement even though their action is, and legally can be, the same with respect to the oldest of the new?</text>

            <text syncTime="3155.708" offset="12622785">The agency could have made choices that would affect this, that would affect the safety, and that would also affect the environment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3167.398" offset="12669492">The agency concedes it had the discretion, and it concedes that this could affect the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.919" offset="12687673">What the agency does is say that that's all about the President because the President lifted the moratorium.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.694" offset="12714736">But where that is a mistake is because Congress was the... was the body that said when trucks can come over, and it gave both the President and the agency separate authority over that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3572.157" offset="14288562">--The... the... first of all, the agency... the agency did an EA in order to determine it didn't have to produce an environmental impact statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.994" offset="14319909">If they were wrong on that, that should have been called to their attention on this precise point, specifically that the agency should have adopted an even more stringent alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.580" offset="14350315">And it's... and even now, they don't identify one that the agency could do that wouldn't be... essentially be a pretext, Justice Souter, as you were suggesting, that would be consistent with their duty to let in trucks and... and still have... have more flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.208" offset="14400784">What they quote for this is on page 193 of the joint appendix in the environmental assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.961" offset="14419801">It's important to recognize that that is a portion of the... of the environmental assessment that repeats that our own actions, including the inspections, are not going to have a substantial impact on the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.879" offset="14467448">But even so, we can... we can mitigate that tiny impact, and it's in that context where the agency says, we can try to screen out the dirtier trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.225" offset="14508826">And there's a reference to environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.247" offset="14516976">It's unclear what it means, but I think two pages later the court identifies that there could be leaks from a truck that would be identified during an inspection they could turn over to environmental people from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.344" offset="14561280">So it's focused on a very narrow question, whether... whether the inspections would... would increase the emissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.019" offset="14588029">And respondents have never really challenged the notion, which is what's being addressed here, that... that the increased inspections under these rules would have an impact on... on the environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.265" offset="14625019">I did want to address the... the Clean Air Act regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.859" offset="14639334">We did not raise the regulation that's quoted on page 17 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.302" offset="14653127">We relied, as Justice Scalia pointed out, on the... under the indirect emissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.185" offset="14668696">As I mentioned, the... the agency has no continuing control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.849" offset="14683324">It isn't the control at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.411" offset="14689593">It's control over the subsequent activities, which is the word in the regulation, and the... this agency, a safety-certifying agency, has no continuing control over where these trucks will travel in the U.S., even whether the... even whether the particular trucks come into the U.S.--</text>
