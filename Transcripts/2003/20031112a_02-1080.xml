            <text syncTime="41.488" offset="165930">Well, Mr. Verrilli, it...  perhaps you can say that the language in the statute, because of an individual age...  individual's age...  is somehow ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.468" offset="209816">But to what extent do we have to give some deference to the agency position on the thing?</text>
            <text syncTime="59.238" offset="236878">Because the Government is here taking a position contrary to yours based on agency interpretation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.</label>

            <text syncTime="68.154" offset="272614">That interpretation deserves no deference for three reasons, which I'd like to summarize and then first elaborate on.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.387" offset="297482">The first is that, under Chevron, the question...  the question of deference is not dependent on whether there's a definitional ambiguity in the...  in the specific operative language, in this case of Section 623(a), but on what the...  what that language means as read in the context of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.046" offset="372088">And Chevron says, using all of the traditional tools of statutory construction, and applying that test we submit, as...  as I hope to elaborate this morning, one cannot come to the conclusion that there...  there...  that this statute can be fairly read to authorize the kinds of youth discrimination claims that are at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.758" offset="442932">The second reason, however, is that even if there were...  even if there were ambiguity in general, which we submit there is not, under the holding, the express holding in Mead, the...  the EEOC's regulation here is not entitled to Chevron deference, and the reason for it is this, and this is at page 227 of the Mead opinion in 533 U.S. The very sentence that states the holding in Mead says, a regulation is entitled to Chevron deference if it is...  if it is promulgated in the...  if the agency has been given by Congress the authority to promulgate rules with the force of law, and we acknowledge that is true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.874" offset="595487">But the second half of the test...  this is in the statement of the holding in Mead...  is that the rule has to be promulgated in an exercise of that authority, and the regulation that the EEOC is here defending today was not a...  a rule that was given the force of law by the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.204" offset="660793">In fact, the agency made...  the Department of Labor, when it initially promulgated this regulation, made a deliberate decision not to promulgate it as a rule with the force of law, but instead to promulgate it solely as guidance to the public about its...  about its enforcement authority and it was...</text>

            <text syncTime="1081.501" offset="4325982">It has a different connotation in the seniority provision, which you can find at page 3a of the Government's statutory appendix, which talks about involuntary retirement, down near the bottom of the page, that an employer's plan cannot require the involuntary retirement of any individual specified by subsection 631 of this title because of the age of such individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.567" offset="4422217">Now, in a sense, that means chronological age, but not in the sense that my friends on the other side about 623(a), because what it means really is once you've become old enough that you've bumped up against the age limit, and there are other provisions in 623 in which age functions in exactly that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1368.327" offset="5473280">After all, Congress could have, either in 1964, when it passed Title VII, or in 1967, when it enacted this statute, simply have put the word age into Title VII and had it operate in exactly the same manner Title VII does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.413" offset="5525629">But it made a deliberate choice not to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.931" offset="5535660">The reason it did, I submit, is because the recommendations of the Secretary of Labor in response to the directive of Congress were that the problem of age discrimination in the workplace is fundamentally different than the problem of...  than the problems that were addressed by Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.701" offset="5598772">And the critical difference is this, that the...  the kinds of discrimination that Title VII addressed was discrimination on the basis of characteristics that are always irrelevant to a decision about who should be hired, fired, or promoted, or demoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.107" offset="5656346">And what the Secretary of Labor said is that age is different, the age is not only irrelevant, age distinctions are not always arbitrary, and I submit the Court...  the opinion for the Court in Betts identified exactly that principle, that this is a different kind of problem warranting a different kind of solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.311" offset="5729176">The problem was that there are stereotypes that exist that...  that...  on which employers act that...  that prospective employees are...  don't have the competence or the productivity to handle a job because they are too old, and that was the problem that this statute tried to address and it's why it tried to address it in such a fundamentally different manner than Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.571" offset="5814230">Context makes all the difference here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.883" offset="5823530">Again, and...  and I think the Court really did recognize that in Betts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.310" offset="5837218">Justice Kennedy, in Betts, you had the operative language privileges...  terms, conditions, and privileges of employment, identical in Title VII to...  and the ADEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.032" offset="5884029">But what the Court concluded in Betts was that that language had a different meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.028" offset="5904091">In Title VII it included fringe benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.712" offset="5914749">In the ADEA it did not include fringe benefits, and the reason for that was because reading the provision not in isolation, but in the context of the rest of the statute, it was quite clear that Title...  that the ADEA was meant to address a different kind of problem, and that there was age-based decision-making that was appropriate and not invidious and that ought not to be prohibited by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.177" offset="6000640">And I submit that the kind of age-based decision-making that's at issue in this case is precisely the kind of age-based decision-making that Congress did not want to make unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.002" offset="6039928">And the reason for this is quite...  is quite simply that people at the end of their working lives are in a different position, especially with respect to retirement security measure, which is what at issue...  is at issue here, even than a 41-year-old, someone else in the protected class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.863" offset="6099383">And so when an employer acts, as General Dynamics did here, with the union, to come up with a solution that protected them from a harsh outcome and protected their reliance interests, it's simply not anything remotely within the contemplation of Congress when it...  when it...  in the prohibitory...  prohibitory sections of the ADEA.</text>
