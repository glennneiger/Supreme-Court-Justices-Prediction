            <text syncTime="33.737" offset="134896">Mr. Kneedler.</text>

            <text syncTime="8.854" offset="35318">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.939" offset="47752">14 years ago in the Duro decision this Court held that under the state of Indian law, as it then stood, and Indian tribe could not prosecute an Indian who was not a member of that tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.766" offset="99056">The Court recognized, though, that its decision might create a jurisdictional gap on many reservations, but the Court concluded that if the present jurisdictional regime proves insufficient to meet the needs of reservation law enforcement, the proper body to address that concern is Congress, which has plenary power over Indian affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.577" offset="174289">Congress responded immediately to this Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.946" offset="187768">It... it conducted an extensive inquiry and heard hearings about the consequences of the Court's decision and heard strong expressions of concern by many Indian tribes, by the Federal Government, and by numerous States about the law enforcement vacuum that would be created over many misdemeanor offenses on Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.760" offset="266971">And there was widespread support for Congress to restore the power to Indian tribes to exercise their sovereign power to prosecute non-member Indians.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="76.299" offset="305110">Why didn't... why didn't they extend it to non-Indians?</text>
            <text syncTime="79.917" offset="319634">I mean, if it's a problem when a... a non-member Indian commits an offense on an Indian reservation, why isn't it an equivalent problem when a... a white man commits the same crime on an Indian reservation?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="95.712" offset="382746">I think the answer lies in... in the longstanding jurisdictional regime on Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.164" offset="400614">Going back to 1817, the general Indian crimes statute has authorized prosecutions by the Federal Government over crimes committed by non-Indians, including misdemeanor crimes, and so there was not a jurisdictional void.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.776" offset="463099">The difficulty came... the... the most acute difficulty came from the fact that that statute, again since the earliest times, had... has exempted crimes committed by one Indian against the person or property of another.</text>

            <text syncTime="129.383" offset="517433">They could have solved the problem by simply treating non-member Indians the same way they treat non-Indians.</text>

            <text syncTime="135.087" offset="540317">Congress could have done so, but Congress, with the plenary power over Indian affairs, chose... decided that the proper course or the most appropriate course was to have that jurisdiction exercised by the Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.430" offset="593711">And Congress heard considerable... considerable evidence that that power had long, in fact, been exercised by Indian tribes over other Indians who were not members of the particular tribe.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.820" offset="639269">--There's some ambiguity about what Indian refers to.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.699" offset="718785">First of all, the definition under... under the Indian Civil Rights Act for tribal power, Congress adopted the same meaning of Indian that is applied under the Federal criminal statutes for the purpose of having the two mesh completely.</text>

            <text syncTime="194.243" offset="776882">And under that, obviously, someone who is an enrolled... formally enrolled member would be an Indian, but as this Court pointed out in footnote 7 of its Antelope decision, the... that provision has not been construed to require that strictly, that ordinarily someone who is an Indian and has a tribal affiliation and is recognized by the tribe is also regarded as an Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.206" offset="860787">In this case, though, we have a situation where someone who is an enrolled member of another tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.758" offset="882939">So questions about the... about the... how the statute should be construed or applied in situations where there's not one... someone who's formally a member are... are not present in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="445.971" offset="1783850">Mr. Kneedler, may I raise the... the point that is... is the greatest trouble for me so... so you perhaps could address that?</text>
            <text syncTime="453.476" offset="1813838">Because it follows from what Justice Kennedy has raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.611" offset="1826377">As I understand what we held... forget our language about delegation for a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.265" offset="1853022">As I understand what we held in Oliphant, which we followed in Duro, was that the very concept of... of this dependent or subordinate sovereignty that tribes are... are understood to have, the way we look at Indian issues, is inconsistent with the exercise of tribal jurisdiction over a... a non-member.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.500" offset="1957930">Whether that notion of subordinate or... or dependent sovereignty is constitutional or common law doesn't really matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.271" offset="2001084">As long as we're going to have that concept, that concept is inconsistent with the exercise of the tribe's own sovereign jurisdiction over a... a non-tribal member.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.817" offset="2063256">If we are going to stick with that concept then, it seems to me that we have got to understand the statute in question here as a statute that confers Federal power on the tribe as distinct from one that restores the tribe's sovereign power because the tribe can't have the sovereign power as long as we are going to understand that tribe to have this subordinate sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.700" offset="2174746">And therefore, for me the concepts that we're using pretty much force the conclusion that the... that the power that's being exercised is Federal not Indian.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.415" offset="6305646">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.905" offset="6355592">When Congress amended the Indian Civil rights Act in response to this Court's invitation in Duro, Congress exceeded its power by overruling this... this Court's determination on the limits of tribal sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.896" offset="6407523">The tribal power that Congress can give and take away cannot by definition be a sovereign power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.401" offset="6441587">The tribal court, acting without its own sovereign authority, prosecuted Billy Jo Lara using this Federal authority, and his subsequent Federal prosecution, therefore, double... violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1624.578" offset="6498220">If we take your approach then in trying to carry out what was the will of Congress, I think we'd have to say that the first prosecution doesn't count because the one thing is... seems to me pretty clear from this record, that Congress did not want to have a situation where there was a delegation of Federal authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.294" offset="6601143">The whole idea was that you would have the Federal... the possibility of the Federal prosecution and the tribal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.684" offset="6646700">I... I think that it's... it's inescapably clear that that's what Congress wanted to do, to preserve the possibility of a U.S. attorney prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.242" offset="6692885">So if you're right, then I think making the... the bottom line what would Congress do if it couldn't accomplish what it set out to accomplish, one would say, well, all bets are off and not adopt your position that Congress chose to delegate Federal authority when it seems to me pretty clear that it didn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="1696.088" offset="6784313">Your Honor, I believe that Congress' intent was clear on two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.492" offset="6809913">The first point was that they were attempting to restore tribal sovereignty, which they cannot do by its definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.248" offset="6836976">But they were also clearly trying to close a jurisdictional gap, a jurisdictional loophole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.335" offset="6861322">Under the Government's contention, the entire statute should be thrown out and neither one of those clear intents from Congress can be saved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.591" offset="6894341">But under the... under what the Eighth Circuit did and under what I'm asking this Court to do, the... one of those intents can be saved and that is--</text>

            <text syncTime="1732.697" offset="6930704">You can't... you can't achieve the end by a means other than the means which Congress provided to that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.600" offset="6958393">It did, indeed, intend to close a gap, but the means which it selected to close that gap was the reconferral... the attempted reconferral of inherent sovereignty upon the Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.675" offset="7006668">There's no delegation language in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.044" offset="7016176">They clearly chose the means to the end of... of covering the gap, the means of reconferring sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.800" offset="7051180">And if that is invalid, then the statute is invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2228.857" offset="8915383">One argument is Congress didn't take away this power over... the tribal power to... to prosecute non-tribal members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.681" offset="8962717">There's no act of Congress that said they can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.533" offset="8974106">The reason they can't do that is there's a sovereignty relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.169" offset="8992601">There's no act of Congress that articulated that sovereignty relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.239" offset="9012872">It's just the way we understand things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.925" offset="9023634">The tribes are dependent sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.960" offset="9031784">And on that theory... that's where I... I thought you were coming from originally, and... and on that theory, Congress can't restore it because it can't change that relationship, or at least it hasn't changed that relationship of... of dependent sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.700" offset="9086746">A second way that... that is being explored here is... is on the assumption that Congress by some act took away the sovereignty to prosecute non-tribal members and now wants to give it back.</text>

            <text syncTime="3345.095" offset="13380336">The first point I'd like to make is that this case only involves the question of whether Congress can authorize tribes to exercise jurisdiction over Indians who are members of other tribes or affiliated with other tribes, not non-member Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.105" offset="13440418">And that... that point is significant because it calls into... into play additional powers that Congress has in this area particularly defining the attributes of membership in a tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.860" offset="13479393">Congress has... among those attributes are the eligibility for special benefits, educational benefits, health benefits, housing benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.251" offset="13516904">So someone from another tribe--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3380.951" offset="13523801">And I take it tribal membership is always consensual in the context that we're talking about?</text>

            <text syncTime="3388.107" offset="13552327">Someone always would have the... the ability to disavow his... his Indian affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.242" offset="13572911">I think that would be an important part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.261" offset="13580957">But... so what Congress has done here is simply to identify another attribute of membership or affiliation with a tribe, which is that if you're on another tribe's reservation, you will be subject to that tribe's criminal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.620" offset="13642397">And that is important to law and order on many reservations, as Congress itself realized when it enacted this statute in 1991.</text>

            <text syncTime="3442.525" offset="13770083">I... I think... I think Congress at least under the Necessary and Proper Clause could allow a tribe to maintain jurisdiction over something that happened while the person was tribally affiliated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.514" offset="13809998">The... another fundamental point is the one that Justice Breyer mentioned is that there is nothing in the Constitution that prohibits, the places a limit in this situation on Congress' exercise of its plenary power over Indian affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.790" offset="13863079">And in fact, there's much in the Constitution that points to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.159" offset="13876558">The Constitution refers to the Indian tribes, and as this Court has said, that reference to tribes and to the treaty-making power recognizes tribes as sovereigns, not simply voluntary organizations, but in the Constitution itself recognizes them as sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.187" offset="13940715">And the Court has said that because of those powers and implicit from that is the power of Congress to exercise protective authority over Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.941" offset="13975719">And here that protection includes protection of tribal... tribes from crimes committed by other tribal members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.280" offset="14001110">In solving this serious law enforcement problem, Congress was entitled to be guided by the Constitution itself which recognizes the tribes as sovereign and to vest authority in them as sovereign rather than act in derogation of the Constitution by deeming the tribes to be agents of the Federal Government when a tribal prosecutor is bringing a prosecution under tribal law in... in tribal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.111" offset="14092434">And Congress could rationally reach this conclusion for another important reason, and that is the lesson in history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.448" offset="14121691">History is very important in Indian affairs, and Congress throughout history, since 1817 under a jurisdictional regime that remains in effect, has left to tribes the power to exercise jurisdiction over members of other tribes, as this Court said in United States v. Rodgers where it construed the Indian against Indian exception as intended to allow tribe matters not... and it expressly said, not only with... with their own tribe but other tribes, to be left to the tribe.</text>
