            <text syncTime="9.454" offset="37721">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.798" offset="51096">Congress answered the call of the judiciary by enacting section 1658, a bright line rule that provides a default statute of limitations of 4 years for any civil action arising under an act of Congress after December 1st, 1990.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.805" offset="119118">Section 1658 applies to plaintiff's claims because this Court said in Patterson that plaintiff did not have claims of racial harassment and...  and termination and discharge claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.718" offset="174811">Plaintiff's claims arise under the 1991 Civil Rights Act because that is the act that created the cause of action that plaintiff has filed under.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.377" offset="213473">In Rivers, this Court held that the 1991 act, as amended by the 1991 Civil Rights Act, was a new cause of action that created new liabilities and a new standard of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.130" offset="264464">Therefore, under section 1658, under the plain meaning of that statute, the 1991 Civil Rights Act applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.418" offset="301662">The simple one-sentence statute has been interpreted in such a way as to give it no meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.601" offset="338338">The terms, arising under, and the term, civil action, are simple terms used by this Court repeatedly to describe the statute's reach and that reach includes all civil actions arising under an act of Congress after December 1st, 1990, whether it has roots in or references preexisting law.</text>

            <text syncTime="103.654" offset="414616">Ms. Gorman, one of the anomalies that if...  if you are complaining about a refusal to hire, a discriminatory refusal to hire, the limitation would be 2 years, but if you're complaining about a discriminatory firing, it would be 4 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.677" offset="494655">Does that make sense to...  to have those two claims both stemming from the original 1981, but one having extended it?</text>

            <text syncTime="135.855" offset="543347">I...  I believe it does, Your Honor, and the reason is that the purpose of section 1658 is to cut down on borrowing and State limitations periods that have been used for the borrowing purposes, and anything that cuts down on those purposes of borrowing is going to be going to the effect of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.960" offset="611788">Now, the fact that there are two statutes of limitations is not unusual in...  in the discrimination cases that I file.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.276" offset="637074">There are often many statutes of limitations that someone has to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.808" offset="651180">For example, in the Age Discrimination Act, there are two statutes of limitations for willful and not willful.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.835" offset="675318">Often claims are filed under section...  under title VII, as well as under section 1981, and we have various statutes of limitations that we deal with in those claims as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.273" offset="773016">And it is a default statute of limitations, so Congress has the option at any time of creating a...  a statute of limitations going back to 1981 if it thinks that this is not the way it wanted it to work out.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.161" offset="820558">But it...  the statute is clear that it's for all new causes of action or for all causes of action that arise under acts of Congress after December 1st, 1990, and I think it's very clear that plaintiffs' claims did not arise until the 1991 Civil Rights Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1020.653" offset="4082521">Originally the act, as proposed by the Federal Courts Study Committee, would have applied a uniform statute of limitations to all existing causes of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1034.109" offset="4136333">So the...  the compromise that was adopted was that the uniform statute of limitations would apply on a going-forward basis with respect to causes of actions that were created by acts of Congress enacted after December 1990.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.659" offset="4186593">This case involves precisely such a cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1443.447" offset="5773688">And that had created great uncertainty and great disparity in the application of Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.360" offset="5793437">Indeed, under the old practice, a single Federal claim could be subjected to 50 different State statutes of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1473.540" offset="5894060">Petitioners' claims only exist today as a result of Congress' action in the 1991 act, and we think they're clearly governed by the default statute of limitations established by section 1658.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.512" offset="5942021">As petitioners' counsel made clear, section 1658 is only a default rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.231" offset="5972846">Congress can always specify a different rule and it has done so several times since 1990.</text>

            <text syncTime="1599.425" offset="6397597">It seems to me that there are two propositions that arise out of the conversation of the past 25 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.119" offset="6420376">First of all, there is no single uniform meaning of the...  of the expression, arising under.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.459" offset="6453812">It is a...  it is a phrase that is used repeatedly in different contexts, routinely used with a very pragmatic...  in a very pragmatic fashion and does not answer the question whether or not Congress, when it adopted 1658, or Congress, when it amended section 1981, really envisioned this kind of expansive interpretation that would allow an argument to be made that State laws are suddenly subject to statutes of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.837" offset="6559347">As Justice Scalia asked, when you make other kinds of adjustments in these schemes, are you going to have to resolve every...  every one of these issues?</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.774" offset="6587037">I mean, the question with respect to the split in the circuits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1677.898" offset="6711589">But I'm quite certain that it's not good news either for my clients, for the lower courts that are going to have to adjudicate these problems or for...</text>

            <text syncTime="1845.620" offset="7382413">I mean, it's that very often major pieces of legislation are enacted in the form of what looks like an amendment of a current statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2069.824" offset="8279249">So you'd probably have to follow the State tort law statute of limitations for half the case and the contract statute of limitations for the other half of the case, after you figure out which State law applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.137" offset="8324493">So you have this problem, even if you're referring back to State law, of maybe coming out with two different results.</text>

            <text syncTime="2798.566" offset="11194201">As perhaps the most frequent litigants in suits alleging violations of Federal law, the States and their officers have an overriding interest in this case in ensuring that section 1658 is construed to establish a clear and easily discernible rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.259" offset="11253029">That in my mind leaves two options.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.263" offset="11269016">There are effectively two clear options on the table.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.371" offset="11277479">One is to apply section 1658 to all section 1981 claims and the other is to...  is to continue the practice of applying State borrowed statutes of limitations to all of those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.311" offset="11321156">Both of those rules create the same level of certainty, but one of those rules, namely the...  the rule that would apply section 1658 to all section 1981 claims, is plainly inconsistent with Congress' intent and indeed with the language of section 1658 itself in that it would apply to claims that on any understanding arose under preexisting law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.919" offset="11399628">Accordingly, the State submits that the respondent's position here is the best among the available alternatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="2855.780" offset="11423033">But, Mr. Newsom, the reason that Congress grandfathered the claims that already existed, as Mr. Phillips said, was because of expectations that I'm off the hook after 2 years, say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.755" offset="11486981">That...  that doesn't exist when a right is created, a right to relief, that didn't exist before.</text>

            <text syncTime="2880.095" offset="11520313">Well, I think the...  the expectations that Congress sought to protect in...  in section 1658 were expectations with respect to certain categories of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.920" offset="11559602">In enacting section 1658 Congress recognized that there were certain categories of claims that had developed established limitations rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.516" offset="11590008">For instance, under this Court's then-recent decisions in Wilson v. Garcia and Goodman v. Luken Steel, section 1983 claims as a...  as a category and section 1981 claims as a category were both subject to single borrowed State statutes of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.037" offset="11652075">So I think the expectation that Congress sought to protect was the expectation of a litigant that I have a 1981 claim and it will be subject to the following statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.151" offset="11692513">So I think the...  that...  I mean, it sounds to me that there is agreement this morning that...  that the appropriate test to apply is the test whether or not Congress has created a new cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.685" offset="11738697">I think the clearest evidence that Congress has done that, that Congress has created a new cause of action, is where Congress creates and enacts an entirely new, separate statutory section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.648" offset="11782583">And again, contrary to petitioners' suggestions...  and Justice Kennedy is quite right...  there are numerous times that Congress has, since December 1 of 1990, created an entirely new and freestanding causes of action to which section 1658 would certainly apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.470" offset="11841829">Now, Congress' choice in the 1991 Civil Rights Act not to create a new statutory section and instead to...  to work within the four corners of section 1981 and to...  to fine tune the existing cause of action that already existed in section 1981 is a strong indication...</text>

I suppose any suggestion that we would be creating a...  a problem for Congress in giving it...  in posing a dilemma for it is that they can provide, number one, a new statute and have the statute of limitations set forth specifically.</text>

            <text syncTime="3115.681" offset="12462707">Any...  I...  I certainly agree that any rule this Court adopts could be superseded by a subsequent amendment of...  of an enactment by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.432" offset="12497711">But in the meantime, this Court we think ought to adopt a rule that minimizes confusion and...  and maximizes certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.626" offset="12522475">That, in essence, is...  is the...  is the...  the proposition coming out of this Court's decision in Wilson v. Garcia, as Mr. Phillips said, which is that in that case, Justice O'Connor, for instance, made a very good point in her dissent that...  in that 1983 claims run the gamut from police brutality claims on the one hand to...  to school desegregation cases on the other and thought that it just didn't make sense to apply a single statute of limitations to such a wide variety of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.240" offset="12632921">And this Court held...  and I submit correctly...  that the practical considerations, those of maximizing certainty and minimizing litigation, required the enactment...  or the...  the imposition of a single categorical, some would surely say formalistic, statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3191.404" offset="12765518">So sometimes it's cutting it down and sometimes it's expanding it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3195.491" offset="12781923">And the State's principal interest here is in...  is in a...  a clear statute of limitations, not necessarily the shortest statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.460" offset="12813793">Our interest here is...  is principally in clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.348" offset="12825391">So again, if I can just emphasize, Congress...  Congress acted in section...  or rather in the 1991 act against a very specific backdrop, namely this Court's then-recent decision in Goodman v. Luken Steel, which held that a...  that a single borrowed State statute of limitations would apply to all section 1981 claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.209" offset="12920790">Now, if Congress wanted to walk away from Goodman and create a new cause of action so as to trigger section 1658's 4-year statute, then our submission is then it had to be clear about what it was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.931" offset="12967706">It had to...  in the paradigmatic example, it had to create a new standalone section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.504" offset="12989962">At the very least, it had to create a...  a self-contained and freestanding civil action within the confines of section 1681.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.982" offset="13023922">But where it merely defined the term in a preexisting cause of action, we submit that that is simply not clear enough to...  to apply the...  the 4-year statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3328.206" offset="13312731">Your Honor, defendant raised two statutes that they...  that they could now point to that they said would benefit from section 1658.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.383" offset="13361528">They pointed to the Muhammad Ali Boxing Act and the anti-discrimination law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.296" offset="13381172">And I submit to this Court, as Justice Breyer said, those aren't going to be new acts either because if you look at those acts, they're actually amending previous acts, and they pull definitional terms out of previous acts from before 1990.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.042" offset="13436134">If defendant's interpretation is accepted by this Court, then we are basically saying section 1658 is a nullity because we have scoured the statutes enacted by Congress after December 1st, 1990 and we could not find one statute that would benefit from section 1658, because Congress often takes terms or definitions or causes of action from previous statutes and amends, even when it thinks it's creating or it looks like it's creating something brand new.</text>

            <text syncTime="3418.984" offset="13675833">Well, Your Honor, if that's the case, then I think what respondent must be suggesting then is that section 1658 would only come into play if the new statute was the only statute you were relying on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.699" offset="13726720">And I don't think that's what section 1658 is stating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.793" offset="13739154">I think if...  even if this Court says, we're relying on old section 1981, as well as 1981 as amended by the Civil Rights...  Civil Rights Act, clearly our claim is still dependent on the 1991 act and therefore section 1658 would still come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.792" offset="13811148">And as far as confusion, defendant suggested that there was even confusion in this case because the judge in our case did not know if class 2 claims were covered by this section 1658.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.879" offset="13863497">There is no confusion with the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.396" offset="13873528">It just wasn't briefed before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.253" offset="13880947">There was no record before the court because we had asked for a slightly different definition in our class certification, and the judge went beyond that definition and established a different class for the class 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.059" offset="13928176">So the judge just didn't have the record and he thought we could figure that, which I think we probably could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.056" offset="13948134">And I think the answer is going to be that the class 2 claims also fall under the 1658 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.173" offset="13968614">The question before this Court is a narrow one: does section 1658 apply to plaintiffs' cause of action for racial discrimination and termination</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.660" offset="14010619">Those claims were not created until the 1991 Civil Rights Act, and I submit to the Court that section 1658 should apply to those claims.</text>
