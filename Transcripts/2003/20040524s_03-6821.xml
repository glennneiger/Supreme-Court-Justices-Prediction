            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="7.874" offset="31451">This case comes to us on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.915" offset="55589">The petitioner was convicted of capital murder and was given a death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.740" offset="74919">The petitioner has severely compromised veins which are inaccessible by standard techniques for gaining intravenous access for administration of a lethal injection.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.819" offset="127269">The weeks before he scheduled execution, the petitioner learned that Alabama prison officials intended to use a so-called cut-down procedure to access his veins if they were unable to access them with a needle.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.046" offset="192157">The petitioner who had already filed once an unsuccessful habeas application filed a complaint under 42 United States Code Section 1983, claiming that use of the cut-down procedure would violate the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.028" offset="256104">He sought a stay of the execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.695" offset="266762">The District Court dismissed ruling that the petitioner’s request for temporary and permanent injunctive relief was the functional equivalent of a second or successive habeas corpus petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.113" offset="320366">That was affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.990" offset="335935">It is true that prisoners cannot use Section 1983 injunctive actions to challenge the fact or duration of their confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.976" offset="375850">Otherwise, they could easily circumvent the procedural and substantive restrictions contained in the federal habeas statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.508" offset="413989">But Section 1983 is available for petitioners to challenge the conditions of their confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.288" offset="445127">We have not yet addressed whether an inmate’s challenge to a state method of execution constitutes a challenge to the fact of an inmate’s death sentence or the conditions of death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.770" offset="495073">We do not reach that broad question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.055" offset="508134">The respondents concede that Section 1983 would be an appropriate vehicle for a prison inmate who is not facing execution to challenge use of a cut-down procedure to access his veins for purposes of medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.728" offset="582844">We see no reason to treat petitioner’s claim differently solely because he has been condemned to die.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.685" offset="614713">If as a legal matter, the cut-down were a statutorily mandated part of Alabama’s lethal injection protocol or if as a factual matter petitioner were unable or unwillingly to concede alternatives for obtaining venous access, the respondents might have a stronger argument that success on the merits and an injunction would call into question the death sentence itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.445" offset="713770">But the petitioner has been careful in his complaint and throughout these proceedings to argue that the cut-down procedure is wholly unnecessary as a factual and legal matter and to propose alternatives that, if used, would allow Alabama to proceed with the execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.944" offset="783673">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.716" offset="798824">The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.882" offset="819513">The opinion is unanimous.</text>
