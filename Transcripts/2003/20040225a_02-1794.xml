            <label>Ms. Lisa Schiavo Blatt</label>
            <text syncTime="94.123" offset="376477">Well, I don't think it's an advisory opinion in that the evidence has been suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.550" offset="390165">But, Justice Breyer, let me directly answer your question on why the case is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.265" offset="405002">In 2002, the Ninth Circuit held that the Constitution is violated if customs officials remove and open a gas tank without reasonable suspicion, and in that case there was reasonable suspicion, making the case very difficult to challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.609" offset="454426">The Government legitimately wanted to challenge the case in a... in a... in a case where the officers actions could not be subject to a potential Bivens liability for violating the clearly established law of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.785" offset="503118">At the same time, customs officials viewed the Ninth Circuit's decision as posing an immediate and present danger to their ability to protect the border, and they thought it imperative to try to challenge a... bring up a case that challenged that rule as soon as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.987" offset="559856">So two weeks after the Ninth Circuit's decision was decided, respondent drove across... drove across the border with a gas tank full of 80 pounds of marijuana, and the Government, we think legitimately, told the district court, and there was no secret at any time in this case, including at the petition stage, that we were not going to put on evidence that there was reasonable suspicion, even though the dog alerting and the solid-sounding tap of the gas tank, we could have established or presumably could have established that that was reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.458" offset="677825">And both the district court and the Ninth Circuit summarily affirmed the... suppressed it and then affirmed the suppression, because there was not reasonable suspicion, and that's why this case is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.368" offset="717427">The customs officials see this case as a threat to their ability to deter and detect smuggling at a container that is relatively large and that is commonly used... in fact, it is the most common container used along the Mexican border--</text>

            <text syncTime="200.627" offset="802482">I mean, it's not a violation of article 3 for us to decide it on your basis, but still, this Court deals with concrete cases with actual facts and not with abstract questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.540" offset="858070">So is it... is it your notion... is it correct that what the Ninth Circuit says becomes clearly established law so that an officer would genuinely be... be subject to Bivens liability when this Court hasn't addressed the question?</text>

            <text syncTime="238.894" offset="955559">It seemed more appropriate from our perspective to try to bring a case as soon as possible where we think we could have proven reasonable suspicion, but it squarely fit within the Ninth Circuit's rule that reasonable suspicion was required.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.498" offset="1017940">The Government does not want to have to put on witnesses, get officers up from the border, have them sit in court, go through the motion to suppress, so that you have a very real interest simply in expediting trial procedures by taking the course you did.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.094" offset="1084291">I don't know if that helps you on this article 3 problem or--</text>

            <text syncTime="274.438" offset="1097665">It... it helps to explain why we thought there was a paramount interest in getting the case as soon as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.146" offset="1116578">We didn't want to divert resources away from the border into having to prove our reasonable suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.726" offset="1134864">In fact, there's already been serious fallout in terms of trying to prove reasonable suspicion when we search gas tanks, because the Ninth Circuit has said that all of our discovery on how we train our dogs has to be produced, and this is extremely sensitive information.</text>
