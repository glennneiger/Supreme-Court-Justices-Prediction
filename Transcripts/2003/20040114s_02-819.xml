            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="10.373" offset="41482">This case, which comes to us from the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, involves a question of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.686" offset="74710">The setting is a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.722" offset="90802">Key to our decision is the distinction between laws determining a court's subject matter jurisdiction, in other words, laws defining the kinds of cases courts are authorized to hear, and rules of a lesser order governing the processing the claims in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.676" offset="166661">The underlying controversy involves a bankrupt debtor, Dr. Andrew Kontrick and his principle creditor and former partner in plastic surgery, Dr. Robert Ryan.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.067" offset="208248">Ryan objected to an order that would discharge Kontrick from his debt, in fraud of creditors, Ryan complained, Kontrick had converted a husband-wife joint bank account into an account in his wife’s name only thereafter Kontrick continued to deposit his salary checks into that account and use the funds not to pay creditors but to cover everyday family living expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.983" offset="323918">Bankruptcy Rule 4004 gives creditors a 60-day period to object to a debtor’s discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.425" offset="357669">The Rule allows one time extension but only if the creditor asks for the extra time before the initial 60-day period expires.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.178" offset="404689">Ryan missed the initial 60-days and did not ask for an extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.850" offset="423393">Kontrick, nevertheless, answered Ryan’s claim, litigated the question whether the name change and the bank account defrauded creditors and lost on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.497" offset="465920">After that loss, Kontrick urged the time bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.059" offset="480235">He said he could do so however late the date because Bankruptcy Rule 4004's time prescription is jurisdictional and therefore, a matter that could be raised even after an adjudication on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.469" offset="545855">The courts below held that Rule 4004 is not jurisdictional and therefore, could not be invoked to nullify the decision in Ryan’s favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.047" offset="588173">We granted certiorari because other courts have held that Rule 4004's time prescription is jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.478" offset="629864">Rule 4004 we now affirm is not jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.367" offset="649404">The subject matter jurisdiction of Federal Courts, the cases those courts can hear and decide maybe prescribed only by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.555" offset="686184">Congress prescribed that objections to discharges fall within the Bankruptcy Court’s subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.469" offset="717845">Congress built no time constraint into that statutory authorization, instead the time limit’s relevant here are contained in rules and procedure for Bankruptcy Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.470" offset="765806">Those rules do not delineate what cases Bankruptcy Courts are competent to adjudicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.985" offset="787853">They are simply plain processing rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.056" offset="800183">In arguing that Rule 4004 should have the same practical effect as a statutory provision governing subject matter jurisdiction contract overlooks this critical difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.483" offset="857861">Characteristically, a court’s subject matter jurisdiction cannot be enlarged to account for the party’s litigation conduct, but a claim processing rule even strict one like Bankruptcy Rule 4004 can be forfeited if the body invoking the rule waits too long to raise a point.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.903" offset="947513">No reasonable construction of complaint processing Bankruptcy Rule 4004 would allow a litigant, in debtor Kontrick's shoes, to defeat a claim as filed too late after the litigant has lost on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.633" offset="1014491">A prime purpose of the rule is to afford the bankrupt debtor and affirmative defense to a complaint untimely filed by a creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.791" offset="1055138">Kontrick raised no such defense when he answered Ryan’s complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.246" offset="1072901">Kontrick additionally argues that Rule 4004’s time constraint is so tight, it allows no recourse to equitable exceptions but Ryan never maintained that he qualified for an equitable exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.764" offset="1130998">Therefore, we do not address the question whether Rule 4004 accommodates equitable exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.434" offset="1161718">The sole question we decide is one of forfeiter.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.683" offset="1178645">Under the governing claim processing rules, the defense is lost if it is not included in the complaint or in an amended answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.556" offset="1214171">Only a subject matter jurisdiction objection lingers on beyond the pleading stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.241" offset="1240921">Kontrick's post-adjudication assertion that Ryan’s claim was untimely is not of that extraordinary order.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.737" offset="1270909">In sum, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeals, we hold that a debtor forfeits the right to rely on Rule 4004 if the debtor does not raise the rule's time limitation before the Bankruptcy Court reaches the merits of the creditor’s objection to discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.447" offset="1345724">The Court’s decision is unanimous.</text>
