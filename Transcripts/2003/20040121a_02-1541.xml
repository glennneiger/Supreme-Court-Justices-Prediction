            <text syncTime="294.925" offset="1179690">At the initial appearance, the judge marked the form saying application for court-appointed counsel, and then wrote waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.658" offset="1214589">In other words, he had given the opportunity at this initial appearance for counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1065.238" offset="4260885">The plea colloquy conducted at respondent's 1996 prosecution adequately informed respondent of the dangers and disadvantages of proceeding without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.290" offset="4293068">Respondent's waiver of counsel and the guilty plea itself were therefore knowing and intelligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.952" offset="4311771">The judgment of the Iowa Supreme Court should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.008" offset="4323997">I think it may be helpful to look first at the precise language that the Iowa Supreme Court employed in announcing the warnings that it thought were constitutionally required, and if the Court looks at page 18 of the appendix to the certiorari petition, that's the paragraph of the Iowa Supreme Court's opinion that's entitled Summary and Disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.979" offset="4407902">And it--</text>

            <label>Mr. Malcolm L. Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="1103.715" offset="4414798">--Of the appendix to the certiorari petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.407" offset="4421590">And if you... if you look in... in the middle of the page, the Iowa Supreme Court in summarizing its holding said, rather, the trial judge need only advise the defendant generally that there are defenses to criminal charges that may not be known by lay persons and that the danger in waiving of the assistance of counsel in deciding whether to plead guilty is the risk that a viable defense will be overlooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.184" offset="4516676">The defendant should be admonished that by waiving his right to an attorney, he will lose the opportunity to obtain an... an opinion on whether under the facts and applicable law it is wise to plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.752" offset="4558994">In addition, the court must ensure the defendant understands the nature of the charges against him and the range of allowable punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.781" offset="4583027">But the third paragraph is... is more... the third sentence is more or less irrelevant because there's no dispute here that the defendant was informed of the nature and... of the charge and the applicable punishments, and that would be done in any standard plea colloquy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.791" offset="4631092">So it's really just the precious two sentences that are at issue, and I think there are some noteworthy points about these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.092" offset="4652304">The first is that the warnings mandated by the Iowa Supreme Court don't contain any declarative sentence to the effect that you have a right to represented by counsel at this plea proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.849" offset="4695353">The Iowa Supreme Court I think took it as given that respondent had been made adequately aware that he had a right to counsel and that what was missing was adequate information about the services that counsel could perform in connection with the plea decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.150" offset="4752509">The second thing is that there's no reference in these warnings to case-specific issues such as possible suppression of evidence or the potential for plea bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.682" offset="4802664">The... the warnings are designed to be warnings that could be given in every single case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.511" offset="4821995">And in our view, the warnings are either vacuous or misleading, depending on how they're interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.487" offset="4849894">If they are accurately interpreted as generalizations about the criminal justice process, they really say nothing more than that as a class lawyers know more about the law than people who are not lawyers, and it's at least possible that consulting with a lawyer would improve your chances in this criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.792" offset="4923141">And I think any defendant who is aware that he has the right to counsel would be aware of those facts, would be aware of at least the possibility that a lawyer could help him and the certainty that a lawyer would know more about the charges than he would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.778" offset="4975073">On the other hand, if the defendant misunderstands these warnings as directed to him personally as availed suggestion that there is actually a meritorious defense in his own case, then the defendant may be given an artificial disincentive to plead guilty and in the case of a non-indigent defendant may be led to spend his own funds consulting with a lawyer when in fact no valid defense exists.</text>

            <text syncTime="1276.677" offset="5106625">It's pretty obvious to me that if you have a right to counsel at interrogation, you certainly have a right to one at the plea bargain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1283.736" offset="5134942">I think it would be constitutionally sufficient, but it's certainly better practice to make sure that the defendant understands that the right extends beyond the questioning itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.159" offset="5168588">And I think that was done in the initial appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.221" offset="5176842">The defendant... there's... there's a form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.957" offset="5183739">The defendant is represented as having waived his right to application for appointed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.273" offset="5209025">I suppose that still leaves open the possibility that he could have retained counsel if he had chosen to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.557" offset="5230132">But I think that certainly apprised the defendant of the right... of... of the fact that his right to counsel extended beyond the initial questioning itself and would continue for the duration of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.960" offset="5271824">And we'd also point out that because this is a collateral challenge, the defendant bears the burden of establishing that no knowing and intelligent waiver occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.050" offset="5304111">And to the extent that there's a gap in the record on this point, I think the defendant is properly chargeable with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.706" offset="5326785">I'd also like to return to the point that Justice Kennedy made earlier about the possibility that in some cases an attorney might be able to obtain suppression of incriminating evidence or might be able to negotiate with the prosecution about possible plea bargains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.167" offset="5396584">I think first it's noteworthy that the standard rule 11 colloquy mentions several constitutional rights that an individual gives up by pleading guilty, but it doesn't mention the possibility of suppressing evidence and it doesn't mention the possibility of plea bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.483" offset="5457920">So it would be odd to think that you could have a constitutionally valid waiver even though the defendant was not informed of those substantive possibilities but would, nevertheless, have to be informed of the assistance that a lawyer might provide in connection with those--</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.464" offset="6249848">On... on the other hand, if you're talking about suppression of evidence or talking about plea bargaining, if you give that advice in every case, it's often going to be misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.092" offset="6284330">A trial judge is going to find himself in the position of saying you might be able to bargain with the prosecution over a reduced charge even though he knows that the policy of the prosecutor is not to engage in plea bargaining with respect to a category of cases that includes that one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1606.348" offset="6425391">And I... I think the... the vacuous warnings, the warnings we regard as vacuous, that were mandated by the Iowa Supreme Court are less likely to be harmful than more specific warnings about--</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.545" offset="6466142">But the other point I wanted to make is if the Court decided that it wouldn't be a good idea to warn about suppression of evidence or plea bargaining in every case but maybe it would be advisable to do that in some cases, that would really be thrusting trial judges in an untenable position because the point of having a standardized plea colloquy is to give judges a... a safe harbor, to give them some assurance that if they provide standardized advice in every case, that's going to be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.523" offset="6582021">And if a trial judge had to decide is the likelihood of a successful plea negotiation sufficiently great in this particular case that the defendant should be advised about it or do I see a viable basis for asking for suppression of evidence, it would really make the trial judge's life much more difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.273" offset="6653074">And if the Court were to hold, as a matter of constitutional law, that the trial judge is required to do that and can be reversed for failure to, it would really cause disruption.</text>

            <text syncTime="1691.942" offset="6767700">Before a court may accept a guilty plea from an uncounseled defendant, the Constitution requires that the defendant be advised of the following: of his right to have counsel present prior to and during entry of the guilty plea, including appointed counsel if necessary; that by waiving counsel, he will lose an independent opinion of his case and on the wisdom of pleading guilty; and that by waiving counsel, he risks overlooking potential defenses that he as a layperson may not recognize.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.659" offset="6942616">The Iowa Supreme Court applied the rules of Patterson and Faretta, determining that a uncounseled defendant who chooses to plead guilty must be given a meaningful discussion regarding the usefulness of counsel at the plea proceeding and the dangers of proceeding pro se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.377" offset="7009489">The court determined that the best way to fulfill that obligation is to advise the defendant of the risks of overlooking potential defenses and of the loss of an independent opinion regarding his case.</text>

I guess the difficulty that I have with that is no... no question about the... the soundness of those general statements, but they are so general that they... they raise the question whether there are really very many defendants that don't know that to begin with and whether there is a real utility in requiring those warnings and hence paying the price in the mistaken cases when they're not given.</text>

            <text syncTime="3048.283" offset="12193123">If in fact the defendant here, Mr. Tovar, says, yes, I was guilty of driving under the influence and I know that the test said that and I don't disagree with it, what public policy is there to try to get him to change his mind because you might have suppressed some of that evidence?</text>

            <text syncTime="3067.436" offset="12269714">We're not attempting to make defendants change their mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.335" offset="12285283">What Mr. Tovar and the Iowa Supreme Court is hoping to do is to ensure that a defendant knows exactly what they're getting into when they plead guilty, that they know that they have the availability of counsel and the basic services counsel can provide, and therefore they will be pleading guilty uncounseled with their eyes open.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.432" offset="12361665">The... the plea colloquy suggested... or the waiver colloquy suggested by the Iowa Supreme Court is not unduly burdensome.</text>

            <text syncTime="3115.362" offset="12461349">That is to say, we've gone through the elements of the crime and you acknowledge that you've committed all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.049" offset="12488098">What you ought to know, however, is that if you got an attorney, he might find some gimmick that would allow you not to be convicted of this crime even though you have committed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.104" offset="12536372">You should know that because it's your right, you know, to know that you can get off even where you're guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3177.944" offset="12711706">The colloquy suggested by the Iowa Supreme Court is certainly not going to prevent anyone from pleading guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.610" offset="12738351">The State speaks of the defendant who wants to expeditiously accept responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.422" offset="12757682">That person is more than likely going to plead guilty regardless of the length of the colloquy given by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.619" offset="12798433">However, what... the only person that may possibly be deterred by this sort of a colloquy is the defendant who's already experiencing doubts as to... to his decision of whether to plead guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3212.168" offset="12848588">Do you think it would be valuable in California to have somebody there to say, by the way, this is the second time you've stolen a chicken and if you plead guilty and do it again, you may go to jail the rest of your life?</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.622" offset="12886413">Or if you're in, say, Alaska, this seems to be an assault case but it's connected, in fact, with the charge of sexual assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.765" offset="12915043">So if you plead guilty, the rest of your life you're going to have to be registered as a sex offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.223" offset="12932807">Or to say, for example, if you're immigrant, you know, it may not seem to be important to you because it just happened to be hitting your child or something, you know, a slap or something like that, but you're going to be deported likely if you plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.490" offset="12977946">Would it be useful to have a lawyer there to tell them that?</text>

            <label>Ms. Theresa R. Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="3246.431" offset="12985678">Absolutely, Your Honor, because the district court isn't necessarily required to tell the defendant such things and we're seeing in cases like Lockyear v. Andrade, Ewing v. California where petty offenses, because they are tied in with recidivist statutes, are creating life sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.688" offset="13054746">And it would make sense to have an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.576" offset="13066240">If we're going to have this robust system of recidivist statutes, then we should also have a robust system of safeguards to ensure that a defendant's due process rights are protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.524" offset="13106051">The... the plea... the waiver colloquy suggested by the Iowa Supreme Court is not going to inhibit the plea process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.236" offset="13140846">Again, it's adding a few lines to the colloquy that's already required for the acceptance of guilty pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.385" offset="13165505">Furthermore, such a standard would actually assist the State in the long run.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.867" offset="13191419">These standards places the waiver colloquy on the record for all to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.326" offset="13209287">This assists not only the initial court in making the waiver decision as an initial decision, but it also assists any future court that may have to make a determination of the validity of the waiver.</text>
