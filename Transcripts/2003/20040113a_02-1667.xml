            <label>Mr. Michael E. Moore</label>
            <text syncTime="8.711" offset="34795">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.509" offset="49946">Whether the Court chooses to view Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act in the entirety of its indiscriminate application through every facet of every state program, activity, and service, or in the alternative, as the private respondents urge, in the narrow courthouse access context, presented by the particular allegations of the complaint they have filed in this case, the Court should conclude that Title II exceeds Congress' enforcement authority under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment for essentially two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.342" offset="193306">First, because there was no evidence before Congress that the states were involved in a widespread pattern of violations of the Fourteenth Amendment rights of disabled persons when the ADA was enacted in 1990.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.974" offset="243879">And second, because Title II shares all of the incongruent and disproportionate features that proved fatal to Title I of the same statute in the Garrett case and then some.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.893" offset="295497">Title II's lack of congruence and proportionality to any identified constitutional injury inflicted upon disabled persons by the states is apparent, we say, on the face of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.170" offset="344607">Congress made no effort to tailor its provisions to those contexts which might conceivably pose a threat to the exercise of fundamental constitutional rights by individuals with disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.816" offset="399256">Instead, Title II applies indiscriminately to every service, program, or activity of the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.157" offset="432588">Let's assume that the... that the state... and it's just an assumption... would concede that sovereign immunity could be abrogated insofar as access to courthouses for handicapped people, so that Congress could have drafted a congruent and proportional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.221" offset="528823">The fact that this injury comes within a statute which has a much larger coverage is grounds for striking the statute down, even though this case involves what we will assume to be a... an injury that could be remedied under the Fourteenth Amendment with money damages?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Moore</label>
            <text syncTime="154.347" offset="617326">Your Honor's question focuses on a debate that we really haven't engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.603" offset="650344">It's... it's one between the respondents and the United States, because in our view, whether the Court views the statute in its... in overall operation, or as focused narrowly on the courthouse access context, either analysis leads to the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.860" offset="719412">Having said that, I would say that the prohibition of Title II is a single, unitary, very elegant one-sentence prohibition in section 12132 of Title 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.579" offset="786286">It doesn't purport to subdivide the statute... the statute's prohibitions into particular subject matter areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.502" offset="817946">And as the United States points out in its brief, this Court's prior congruence and proportionality cases in... in the abrogation context suggest that the Court looks usually at the overall operation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.106" offset="880327">If the Court chooses that perspective on this problem, we think yes indeed, even if the statute, assuming the statute, a narrowly-tailored statute could have been drafted that would validly abrogate sovereign immunity in the courthouse access context, Title II's flaw is that it is not so targeted.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.351" offset="961306">In fact, of the myriad activities it covers, Your Honor, a very small percentage conceivably implicate the exercise of any constitutional right.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.145" offset="1220545">There is no provision in the Public Buildings Act requiring retrofitting.</text>

            <text syncTime="736.861" offset="2947344">And if there's one context in which one would expect to find case law, it is in the courthouse access context, because after all, the business that takes place there is litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.802" offset="2991125">We think that is a particularly telling point.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.011" offset="3007948">Similarly, in... we find in the Government's brief, who has... the Government has called from Your Honor's appendix the pertinent entries, and we find eight of them that have sufficient detail that would permit one to actually ask the question, was a constitutional violation involved?</text>
            <text syncTime="777.607" offset="3110348">And we say that under the... even the most creative interpretation of any of them, they don't make out a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.099" offset="3148382">All of the other references to courthouses in appendix C to Your Honor's opinion, we've pulled every single of them, and they simply... they simply label courthouse facilities as inaccessible.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.648" offset="3198537">But, of course, under the ADA, inaccessible is a term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.703" offset="3210762">It doesn't mean there's literally a wall around the building and no one can get in.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.881" offset="3223510">It means that they are inaccessible in the sense that the... the amenities required by the ADA are not present, so that there are not... there is no evidence before this Court, and there was no evidence before Congress, that anyone's constitutional rights, rights of access to the courts, were being violated as the result of the existence of these architectural barriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.002" offset="3331971">And for those reasons, we don't think the... the so-called task force report, which is summarized in the appendix to Your Honor's dissent in Garrett, helps the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.674" offset="3390694">There is no mention in the text of the act itself, of course, of courthouse access, and if one looks at the Senate and House reports on the legislation, one will discover that there is not a single mention of the subject anywhere and no other indication that Congress thought courthouse access was a matter of particular concern.</text>

            <text syncTime="3348.700" offset="13394756">Those remedies are entirely judge-made, and as the Thornburgh amicus briefs points out, to the extent that those remedies are the gravamen of the constitutional concern, their judge-made origins gives this Court unique flexibility to interpret the compensatory damages remedy in a way that renders the statute as a whole constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.338" offset="13477303">Broadly speaking, Congress, in passing this statute, found a real problem with the individuals and the entities that are responsible for protecting the civil rights of everyone, denying the rights of individuals with disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.681" offset="13526622">One element of its solution was the element of compensatory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.717" offset="13546789">Those compensatory damages are an appropriate response, but it would be very sad if that one element of the statute was used to bring down the entirety of Title II, given that it remains vitally necessary to make the promise of the Fourteenth Amendment a reality for individuals with disabilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3432.624" offset="13730482">Very briefly, the type of discrimination Congress was referring to in the statement of findings of... and purpose of the act itself is made clear if the Court examines the fifth finding, which... which tells us what sort... what... what concept of discrimination was in Congress' mind when they used the term throughout those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.919" offset="13835598">And it talks about not just outright intentional exclusion, but it talks about discriminatory effects of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.239" offset="13876872">It talks about overprotective rules and policies and their effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.491" offset="13893904">It talks about failures to make modifications to existing facilities and practices, and exclusionary standards that screen people out, in other words, an another disparate impact sort of conception of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.681" offset="13962658">And I think for that reason one can reliably conclude that... that... that Congress was not using discrimination in the sense of completely arbitrary and irrational discrimination of the sort that's prohibited by section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to disabled persons, but rather, in the findings and purpose, Congress makes clear that it is addressing a very real social problem, one that needs addressing, but one that does not arise to the level of a... a widespread pattern of constitutional violations on the part of the state.</text>
