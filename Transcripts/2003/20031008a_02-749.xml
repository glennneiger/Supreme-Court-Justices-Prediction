            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="79.467" offset="317858">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="82.272" offset="329038">Petitioner, like thousands of other employers throughout this country, has a policy that if an employee is discharged for violating a workplace rule... usually that involves serious misconduct in the... in the workplace... then he becomes permanently ineligible to be rehired by that particular employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.438" offset="401659">The court of appeals in this case correctly held at Fed. App. 12a, note 17, that there is no question that petitioner applied this policy in rejecting respondent's application.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.962" offset="443768">And the court of appeals also held that there's no question that this policy on its face is not unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.361" offset="469368">Nonetheless, the Ninth Circuit declared that even in a case alleging only disparate treatment, the, quote, policy violates the ADA as applied to former drug addicts whose only work-related offense was testing positive because of their addiction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="130.941" stopTime="193.728">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="130.941" offset="523703">Mr. Phillips, it... the Ninth Circuit in its opinion on about page 8a in the appendix said, Hernandez raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was denied reemployment because of his past record of drug addiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.166" offset="624640">And I'm concerned that the court may have said there is a genuine issue of fact here, that it wasn't clear whether there was a no-hire policy that was either adopted or if it was used in this case, that there's something else at stake due to the different responses of the man who wrote the letter versus the woman who actually made the decision, and that there's some issue of fact here.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.238" offset="752849">Now, if that's the case, maybe the rest of the opinion is just dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.068" offset="772180">I don't know.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="193.728" stopTime="252.056">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="193.728" offset="774896">It's pretty clear that the rest of the opinion is not dicta, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.443" offset="789734">The... that portion of the analysis is... is directed solely at the question of whether or not the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case, and what the court said was, you know, is there any evidence from which anyone could draw the inference that there was discrimination because of a disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.098" offset="848353">And it recognized frankly that that was a very close question, that if you read even the... the statement made to the EEOC, you can read that in different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.320" offset="885238">Maybe you should look at Bockmiller.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.449" offset="893701">But the truth is in making the prima facie showing, all that you really needed to look at was the policy statement... or the... the response to the EEOC, and that would be enough, I think, to get you past the prima facie showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.018" offset="936020">It... it is at page 10a where the court then turns its complete attention, and it says, you know, so in sum we hold that... that Hernandez's prima facie case of discrimination has been made out, and now we turn to the next stage in the process, which is to look and see whether or not there is a... a non-pretextual justification.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="252.056" offset="1008222">I might agree with you that a no-hire policy, if that's what was used, is certainly not unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.190" offset="1040718">But if there is a genuine issue of fact here, what... what do we do?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="264.938" stopTime="291.149">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="264.938" offset="1059736">Well, if there were a genuine issue of fact, you... you would... you know, you'd remand to allow the case to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.601" offset="1078335">There's clearly not a genuine issue of fact because if you... once you get past just looking at the EEOC statement that was made by the employer and... and you're in the district court and you're looking at summary judgment and the question is whether or not the action of the employer is pretextual, we only have the burden to come forward and say we had a... a perfectly lawful reason for doing what we did.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="291.149" stopTime="307.207">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="291.149" offset="1164539">Well, aren't the two questions really severable, whether the Ninth Circuit's treatment of the no-rehire policy was correct under ADA law, and second, whether the employer was entitled to summary judgment?</text>
            <text syncTime="305.555" offset="1222217">I... I think those are two different questions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carter_g_phillips" startTime="307.207" stopTime="346.960">
            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="307.207" offset="1228800">Well, I... yes, they are two different questions, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.939" offset="1243742">I think the answer is that I think we probably would have been entitled to summary judgment even on the prima facie showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.527" offset="1270073">The only way the court of appeals got to its analysis... the only way it could have gotten there under Hazen Paper... is to say that the pretextual basis... the pretextual argument that was put forward by the employer... we have to take that off the table because if that... if that policy is in this case, there is not a shred of evidence that that policy was not applied in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.015" offset="1364010">And that's exactly what the court of appeals said in... in the footnote in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.391" offset="1381564">It said that's unquestioned.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="346.960" offset="1387833">Mr. Phillips, I'm having the same problem that Justice O'Connor and the Chief expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.995" offset="1407896">One thing is if we take this case, there's a no-hire rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.332" offset="1425241">Can an employer have such a rule and apply it with even hand?</text>
            <text syncTime="360.334" offset="1441332">That's a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.564" offset="1450214">But this case seems to be underneath messier.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.567" offset="1466201">For example, this no-hire policy was unwritten.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.449" offset="1481770">This is a company that had a lot of written rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.133" offset="1492532">That's an important rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.741" offset="1498906">Why was it unwritten?</text>
            <text syncTime="376.515" offset="1506011">Why does Medina testify we had a right, not that we'd apply it every case, but we had a right not to rehire someone who was discharged for cause?</text>
            <text syncTime="389.684" offset="1558674">The... the record is suspicious on, one, whether there was a policy; two, whether it was applied with an even hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.768" offset="1595037">That one can't tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.625" offset="1602456">So why should a judge take this as given that there was indeed such a policy and that it... it was applied with an even hand?</text>
            <text syncTime="411.317" offset="1645192">Don't those questions remain in the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="414.289" offset="1657104">Even if you prevail on if they had such a policy and if they applied it with an even hand, they would not be offending--</text>

            <text syncTime="443.100" offset="1772356">Well, but I mean, it could not have been more explicit in terms of dealing with this particular issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="456.475" offset="1825855">It may be that it's an unwritten policy, but the testimony in the joint appendix at 22a, 57a, 59a, 71a, 72a, and 73a, which is the affidavit and deposition testimony of Bockmiller who was the decision maker in this case and Medina who signed the... the statement, is consistent, that... that there is an absolute policy and practice that this employer uniformly uses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1046.636" offset="4186488">A policy... a mutual policy of refusing to rehire individuals previously terminated for serious misconduct does not constitute disparate treatment for purposes of the Americans with Disabilities Act even as applied to an individual previously discharged for drug-related misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.286" offset="4257123">The policy does not single out people who are addicted or those who test positive for drugs for disfavorable treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.625" offset="4290456">The policy treats all serious misconduct, whether drug-related or not, the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.289" offset="4309055">As a result, an individual who is refused re-employment pursuant to that policy is simply not subject to disparate treatment because of their disability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1097.063" offset="4388153">Justice O'Connor, in our brief we suggested that it would be possible to grant summary judgment for the employer here on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.289" offset="4417097">I have to confess, though, that that issue is of considerable less importance to the Government than the broader validity of this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.520" offset="4442070">One thing I... I'll address why we think summary judgment might be appropriate, but I want to emphasize, though, that even if the Court thinks that summary judgment is not appropriate here, the proper disposition would be to vacate and remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.318" offset="4493270">But it's very important to vacate the opinion because the theory of the Ninth Circuit, if you can divine one here, is that, all right, there's a pretextual case for discrimination and the employer comes in and says, we didn't discriminate on the basis of disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.776" offset="4547082">We applied a neutral, across-the-board rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.499" offset="4557949">And as I read the Ninth Circuit opinion, what they say is that neutral rule is not a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for your employment action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.665" offset="4594625">And they... they do that as a matter of law, and that is a profoundly wrong decision as a matter of law, especially in a disparate treatment case because Justice Stevens suggested that maybe you could have a reasonable accommodation theory but that's not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.155" offset="4652617">It is possible that the language of 42 U.S.C. 12112(b)(6), which embodies the Americans with Disabilities Act disparate impact principles, could be used to challenge the neutral policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.383" offset="4697443">But whatever else is true, when an employer applies a neutral policy, it has not engaged in disparate treatment on the basis of disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.574" offset="4730253">Now, if I can get back to the summary judgment question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.362" offset="4741433">I think there's two reasons why we thought summary judgment was... would be appropriate for the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.109" offset="4760346">One is as suggested by Mr. Phillips.</text>

            <text syncTime="1444.477" offset="5777868">But that doesn't mean that it's sort of harmless error if the Ninth Circuit opinion stays on the book because the Ninth Circuit assumes that the answer to the question on reasonable accommodation is that you could never justify such a policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.078" offset="5824261">You'd always have to grant a reasonable accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.512" offset="5833979">The Ninth Circuit opinion assumes that there would be a disparate impact even when there's not or even if the employer could justify the policy as job-related and consistent with business necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.741" offset="5878909">I wanted to be responsive to Justice Stevens' question, though, even though I think this Court should ultimately not reach it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.570" offset="5898240">With respect to reasonable accommodation, there's no question that reasonable accommodation applies in the application process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.886" offset="5923527">And so if you have... for example, if you're going... an employer wants to give a application test for the job, and puts it in a facility that's not wheelchair accessible, that reasonable accommodation would have to be given, and that would be a reasonable accommodation in the hiring process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.574" offset="5986220">I do think, though, that subsection (b)(6) addresses very directly a neutral qualification standard that's alleged to screen out an individual with a disability or to tend to screen out an individual with a disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.122" offset="6036480">And with respect to that claim, that would trigger the employer's burden to come forward and show that the requirement was job-related and consistent with business necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.987" offset="6075873">One of the real sort of ironies, if you will, of the Ninth Circuit's opinion is on the same page of the opinion and in consecutive footnotes, after they... they clearly hold that the disparate impact theory is not in this case, they also fault the employer for not justifying the neutral rule as consistent with business necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.306" offset="6153195">But the business necessity defense, as its status as a defense, suggests is not some sort of free-floating obligation on the employer, especially in a disparate treatment case where the employer has already pointed to a neutral and legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for their actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.166" offset="6212650">The business necessity defense comes into a case when a plaintiff has properly preserved a claim under subsection (b)(6) and triggers the obligation of the employer to come through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.197" offset="6252774">I would like to also point out, though, that we largely agree with Mr. Phillips that there is... there is much in 42 U.S.C. 12114(c)(4) that suggests that there may be a basis for an employer to maintain this kind of neutral policy, and I think an employer may be able to use that section as a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.829" offset="6339291">I would agree with Justice Stevens that it doesn't speak directly to this situation because all it does is allow... with respect to current drug users who aren't entitled to any protection under the act, it clarifies that an employer can apply a neutral qualification standard, and it doesn't matter whether the underlying misconduct has its roots in... in drug us or drug addiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.287" offset="6429048">And I think it doesn't directly say it, but implicit in that provision is the idea that an employer can use uniform and neutral sanctions for violations of those uniform conduct rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.342" offset="6477322">The difficult question becomes whether or not there's something special about a bar on re-employment, when you say that if you violate our conduct rules not only are you terminated, but you need never darken our door again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.247" offset="6524970">And I think with respect to that kind of policy, there are two... the act, in a sense, points in two different directions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.009" offset="6547958">On the one hand, the act draws a clear distinction between current drug users who are... who are not protected by the act and draws a distinction between recovered addicts who are protected by the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.049" offset="6592157">In... in any event, the Court can reconcile those competing policies in a subsequent case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1701.160" offset="6804584">Additionally... and then it goes to the question of whether or not this alleged uniform practice is, in fact, valid under the Americans with Disability Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1717.135" offset="6868532">And moreover, because this could be a mixed motive case, even if this Court concludes that the alleged oral practice is valid, the case would still have to be remanded because you... even if the employer had a valid reason to terminate Mr. Hernandez, if it also had a mixed motive and the other motive was invalid, it was... he was also terminated and based upon his history of drug and alcohol addiction, the case has to be resolved by a jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3089.275" offset="12357068">For example, under Raytheon's written rules, a temporary employee who tests positive for drugs and alcohol, quote, will have their assignment terminated and will not be eligible for assignment or for regular employment for the succeeding 12 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.767" offset="12431047">So Raytheon has a written rule that is actually contrary to its alleged oral practice, which impeaches the testimony regarding the existence of the written rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3354.251" offset="13416908">It seems to me that there are two ways to look at this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.057" offset="13428193">One is you can simply take the court of appeals at its word, which is to say we think there's a question for... that... that defeats summary judgment on a prima facie case, but when we get to the question of what the policy is of the... of the employer in this case, there's no dispute about that, the employer's policy was applied, and then address the question of whether or not that policy is valid under the ADA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.741" offset="13510949">I have not heard Mr. Montoya yet attempt to defend that... that holding in the face of a disparate treatment theory in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.930" offset="13543654">He puts in disparate impact under 12(b)(6).</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.348" offset="13553371">He puts in reasonable accommodation, 112(b)(6) and 112(b)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.702" offset="13570717">Those are not issues that were decided below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.681" offset="13578658">They were not the theory of the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.688" offset="13586704">This is a decision that has extraordinary implications because thousands of employers have precisely this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.344" offset="13609273">It is important for this Court to declare that that rule is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.809" offset="13623171">On the secondary question... and that is, can the Court get to that question?</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.775" offset="13639053">I think there's no doubt that the Court ought to just follow the court of appeals' logic on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.497" offset="13649920">But if the Court wanted to look at whether or not there is a question of fact as to whether or not this person was discriminated against because of his disability, I submit to you that the record does not permit a jury to make that finding under this Court's decision in Reeves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.524" offset="13710002">Bockmiller was the decision maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.618" offset="13722436">She testified, without contradiction, that she never looked past the summary sheet that said he was discharged because of conduct, and that was it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.551" offset="13758171">And she didn't have to look beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.104" offset="13764336">Medina testified, without contradiction, that that is the policy that applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.729" offset="13782831">She applied it in the right way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.215" offset="13788787">We do it consistently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.413" offset="13793593">It would have made no difference whether he was a thief or whether he was somebody who used drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.992" offset="13811879">We applied it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.274" offset="13816999">Mr. Montoya and his client had 2 years to discover whether that policy existed, whether it had exceptions, whether it was applied in any other particular way, and there is not one shred of evidence... he didn't even ask those witnesses if there were flaws in the way they applied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.878" offset="13879484">That is absolutely across the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.940" offset="13887739">The only... and... and then, you know, this is a policy that exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.565" offset="13906233">Thousands of employers use precisely this policy, which is why frankly it probably isn't written down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.971" offset="13927863">And so at the end of the day, there is nothing on the other side of this except the one statement that was sufficient to justify getting beyond the prima facie stage of this case, but that is not sufficient to justify taking this to a conclusion or to raise an issue of fact as to whether or not he was discriminated against because of his disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.373" offset="14005394">He was acted against because he violated the company policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.665" offset="14022635">That policy is valid under the ADA, at least as it's been litigated at this point, and for that reason the Court should reverse and enter judgment in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.550" offset="14054191">If there are no other questions, thank you, Your Honors.</text>
