            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="10.071" offset="40229">The apparent suicide of Vincent Foster who has been the Deputy Counsel to President Clinton received wide publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.409" offset="77636">That was some time ago and this case arises in the wake of that tragic event.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.225" offset="100833">The case was brought under the Freedom of Information Act by an interested citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.276" offset="121104">The respondent, whose name is Allan Favish, Favish sought to obtain copies of photographs taken by investigators at the scene of the death.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.899" offset="155585">One way to state the issue of the case in the narrowest possible terms is whether under the Freedom of Information Act Favish can obtain the four photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.899" offset="195500">The larger legal issue is whether the deceased’s surviving family members have privacy interests that they may assert under Exemption 7(c) of the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.721" offset="242834">And if they do have a privacy interest, the question then becomes whether those interests are outweighed by the public interest in disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.445" offset="277734">Exemption 7(c) exempts from disclosure records compiled for law enforcement purposes if their production could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.914" offset="331651">This case originally came to the United States District Court for the Central District of California and the trial judge initially ruled that only one photograph could be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.621" offset="366446">The Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit remanded the case to the application of a different legal standard, and after the District Court followed the instructions of the Court of Appeals, it ordered disclosure of five photographs and the Court of Appeals affirmed as to the release of four of the photographs which are the ones that are in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.615" offset="438439">We granted certiorari and we now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.314" offset="449202">The first issue we address is whether the family members have a privacy interest that can be asserted none of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.623" offset="470413">We hold that the Freedom of Information Act does recognize the rights of family members to personal privacy with respect to their close relative’s death scene images, burial rights or their counterparts have been respected in almost all civilizations from time immemorial.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.249" offset="532898">This well-established cultural tradition acknowledging the family's control over the body and the death images of one of its deceased members has also been long recognized at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.117" offset="576366">We assume that Congress legislated against this background of law in scholarship and history when it enacted the Exemption 7(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="151.705" offset="606772">It would be inconsistent with this presumption when we decide that the statute provides even less protection than the common law did.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.464" offset="633835">To say that the family members have privacy interests does not end the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.096" offset="648359">The next question is whether the invasion of privacy interest is unwarranted, a question that requires us to balance the family’s privacy against the public interest in disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.841" offset="683363">This means we first have to identify the public interest sought to be advanced and the public interest must be a significant one, and the information must be likely to advance that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.452" offset="721711">The interest here is a citizen’s interest in uncovering deficiencies or misfeasance in the government’s investigation into the apparent suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.223" offset="756820">We hold that where the public interest asserted just to show that responsible officials acted negligently or otherwise improperly, the person requesting the information must produce evidence that would warrant a belief by a reasonable person that government impropriety might have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.372" offset="829440">Here, the requester has produced no evidence to put that balance into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.476" offset="845845">It is of relevance we think that five investigations had independently concluded that Foster did commit suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.226" offset="872803">The District Court’s first order in this case followed the correct approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.491" offset="885864">The case is now remanded with instructions to grant the government’s motion for summary judgment with respect to the four photographs in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.622" offset="910420">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
