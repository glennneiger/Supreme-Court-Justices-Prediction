            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">The second case I have to announce is No. 03-526, Schriro v. Summerlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.242" offset="52872">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.721" offset="74815">The petitioner Warren Summerlin was sentenced to death in 1982, 22 years ago, for the murder of Brenna Bailey in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.345" offset="133329">Arizona law authorizes the death penalty if one or more aggravating factors is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.165" offset="160601">At the time that finding of an aggravating factor was made by a judge rather than a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.354" offset="189336">The judge in Summerlin’s case found two aggravating factors and sentenced him to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.314" offset="209189">That sentence was affirmed on Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.368" offset="221414">Nearly 20 years later, we decided in Ring v. Arizona, that Arizona's capital sentencing and procedures violated the Sixth Amendment by allowing the judge rather than the jury to find the facts essential to imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.701" offset="294766">This was an application of Apprendi.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.619" offset="306469">The Ninth Circuit acting on Summerlin’s federal habeas petition held that our decision in Ring could be applied retroactively to his case and overturned his death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.213" offset="356833">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we reverse the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.273" offset="376999">When a decision of this Court results in a new rule, that rule applies to convictions that are already final only in certain limited circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.656" offset="422557">New substantive rules generally apply retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.405" offset="441574">New procedural rules, on the other hand, apply retroactively only, we have said, if they qualify as watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.000" offset="507925">That a new procedural rule is fundamental in some abstract sense is not enough, the rule must be one without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.806" offset="559125">We conclude that Ring’s holding is properly classified as procedural, it did not alter the range of conduct or the class of persons subject to the death penalty in Arizona, but only the method of determining whether the defendant engaged in the criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.404" offset="629551">We further conclude that Ring did not announce a watershed rule of criminal procedure, even though the right to jury trial is fundamental under our constitution, we cannot confidently say the judicial factfinding, as opposed to jury factfinding seriously diminishes accuracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.894" offset="711576">It is a mode of finding the facts used in many other countries of the world, and as I indicated in announcing the prior case, the principal purpose of jury trial in the American system is not accuracy, but assurance of control by the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.758" offset="787017">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.185" offset="808647">Justice Breyer has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg joined.</text>
