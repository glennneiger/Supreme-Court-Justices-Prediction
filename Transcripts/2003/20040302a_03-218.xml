            <text syncTime="1170.032" offset="4680098">This is a remarkable instance of where Congress went through all of the things that the Court identified as problems with the previous statute, grappled with each of these definitions, adopted Court-approved definitions, standards, and limitations with respect to what this Court has agreed is a compelling problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.165" offset="4756584">If I can return to Justice Kennedy's concern about the issue of... take... the commercial pornographers, the statute is very clear that it refers to people that are in the business of profiting from this material, and then the Court... the statute goes on to say what is the business of being engaged in this and says that someone that takes time, effort, or labor in the regular course of a business of... of profiting from the transmission of this material.</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.168" offset="5452591">The other one that was suggested by the respondents is that... and the, and by the Third Circuit... is that somehow Congress should have required that this would be the primary business that the person was engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.337" offset="5505254">Again, that would have been a massive loophole subject to constant litigation over what was the primary business and whether a person's surrounded the harmful material with an acre or two of unharmful material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.209" offset="5568784">What Congress was getting at is that people that are in the business, knowing and knowing the character of the material, two other terms that are in the statute, that are making money distributing this material and who won't take the steps necessary to protect minors from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.543" offset="5638165">With respect to the argument that the respondents make and the court of appeals focused on that blocking at the home might somehow be a problem, Congress carefully considered that, decided it would not be an acceptable solution, except that it did at the same time enact... that it enacted COPA, required that the Internet service providers make that type of information available to people in their homes so that that could be in addition to what COPA requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.723" offset="5758851">The fact is that blocking material in the home is both underinclusive and overinclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.227" offset="5780898">It requires the consumer to go out and buy a product and spend money to adapt it to technological improvements that are happening all the times, and it's readily avoidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.266" offset="5824993">I did the same, this again is outside the record, but I did this, anyone can do this, the same experiment over the weekend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.321" offset="5853205">I went to Google and I typed in disable filter and you push the button and you will get a screen full of programs that will tell you step by step how to dismantle the computer so your parents won't know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.523" offset="5917989">It is that easy, and you can put it back on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.925" offset="5931677">These things are readily avoidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.868" offset="5943380">So the burden that Congress was... was... the burden that Congress imposed at the suggestion of this Court is to put the burden on the person or persons making money on a regular basis from this product to take the minimal steps necessary to prevent the damage that's done every day by minors by allowing people to use mechanisms that are already in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.546" offset="6046093">This Court mentioned it and Congress mentioned it, this adult check mechanism, that's another thing that... that anyone can check out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.180" offset="6076709">Type in adult... adult ID, and then press the button and you will find, I think there were 25 sites that mention in the congressional history which will provide an adult identification at a relatively nominal cost, I think it was 19.95 for a several-month period or something like that, and the availability is such that the steps that can be followed take a matter of less than a couple of minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.978" offset="6179840">So in the privacy of the home, the adult who wants material protected by the Constitution, in order to avoid damage to children in the privacy of the home with statutory protection as to anonymity, the... the problem can... it... it cannot be totally solved, but this is an important major step and this is an example of Congress following the directions of this Court as to how constitutionally to do it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1589.807" offset="6359144">COPA violates the First Amendment for two independent reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.540" offset="6378057">First, it is a criminal statute that suppresses a wide range of protected speech between adults on the Web, and second, the Government has a range of more effective, less restrictive tools available to protect minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.530" offset="6430093">The Government's attempt to narrow the range of speech that is affected by this statute defy the law's plain language, the record, and plain common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.139" offset="6472516">Even under the Government's interpretation, COPA criminalizes speech that under any definition adults have the right to access.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.712" offset="6502818">It criminalizes a depiction or even a description of nudity or even a description or depiction of the female breast.</text>

            <text syncTime="3319.338" offset="13277309">I wanted to go back to where Justice Breyer started, what would be covered by the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.632" offset="13302491">The examples given by the respondents were addressed in the Government's brief and all three of the... all of those examples we don't believe are covered by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.762" offset="13347004">Susie Bright is not within, doesn't fit within the prurient interest in the... and would be defended on... this is reminiscent of what the Court was facing in the American Booksellers case, and the respondents here were involved in that one as an amicus, were 16 examples were cited as the house was going to fall down, the sky was going to fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.545" offset="13430178">This Court decided to remand that to the... the Virginia Supreme Court and the Virginia Supreme Court found that none of the 16 parade of horribles would be even covered by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.951" offset="13467794">That's this all over again, and it flies in the face of the requirement by this Court to find a reasonable, a construction of the statute that would be, to which it would be reasonably susceptible that would deal with those constitutional problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.503" offset="13525995">And... and these definitions, these definitions have already been approved with respect to minors in the Ginsberg v. New York case, so we're not... and that's a couple of... several decades ago, so we're not dealing with something that is brand new.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.621" offset="13586390">Susie Bright, by the way, writes for Salon magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.014" offset="13596003">In order to get her column you have to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.257" offset="13604989">Adult IDs, you can get them with credit cards, you can get them with a check, and as we point out in footnote 2 of our brief, you can use a driver's license or a passport, so you don't have to necessarily use a credit card to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.945" offset="13659742">The... the deterrence issue, all of the... all of the... all the court of... the lower courts decided is that some people may be deterred, may be deterred, and some people may be... find this as an impediment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.135" offset="13716480">Some people may engage in self-center... self-censorship, and to the extent that there are thousands of people, that's an infinitesimal quantity of what's on... on the Web in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.103" offset="13760366">The most important point here, with respect to alternatives, Congress considered, as this Court suggested it should, the various alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.439" offset="13801744">The House, the Senate report's good, but the House report, 775, which is cited all over the briefs on pages 16 through 20 considered all of these examples, the tagging, the filtering and so forth and went through all of the reasons why Congress found that they would not be effective and that what COPA was providing would be effective, that there were costs, the burden should be on the commercial purveyor of the material and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.057" offset="13908219">Congress went through all of these things and made specific findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.629" offset="13922429">At the end of the day, it's important to emphasize this is a facial challenge to a statute constructed according to this Court's guidance, according to this Court's decisions as to how to deal with a very serious national problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.489" offset="13981884">It contains a scienter requirement the purveyor of this material must know what's being done, he must be engaged in the regular course of business, and I can't recall... I think it was you, Justice Breyer... who asked the question, how else could Congress have done it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.181" offset="14040712">This is a national problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.142" offset="14048549">It's serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.451" offset="14053773">It's causing irreparable injury to our most important resource, our children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.396" offset="14073522">Congress has been struggling with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.427" offset="14081672">It listened to what this course had... Court had to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.598" offset="14094315">It examined the nature of the medium, because this is a different medium, but one of the wonderful things about this medium is also the... one of the potentially dangerous parts of this medium.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.726" offset="14138828">It's easily accessible to children in the home and it's important that the Government be... this Nation and its three branches of government be concerned with the care and welfare of children independent of the parents' responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.447" offset="14193685">So this is an example of a serious national problem, Congress following conscientiously this Court's guidance as to how to solve the problem and then laying it out for this Court as to how it did so, and it came up with this statute, which is constitutional.</text>
