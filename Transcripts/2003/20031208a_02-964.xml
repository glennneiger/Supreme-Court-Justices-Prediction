            <text syncTime="14.201" offset="56738">When a state prisoner decides to attack his conviction on the basis of a claimed violation of Federal constitutional right, your cases have held that he must first alert the state courts he is raising a Federal claim, if that claim is to be exhausted for Federal habeas purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.895" offset="151510">But what the prisoner must say to the state courts to tell them he is raising a Federal claim continues to be a... a troubled area of Federal habeas law.</text>

            <text syncTime="92.591" offset="370312">And some courts have held that a Federal claim is fairly presented even when the statement of the claim is clearly a claim under state law only.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hardy Myers</label>
            <text syncTime="3409.198" offset="13636754">Your Honor, so two quick comments or points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.704" offset="13670713">First, this case illustrates the fallacy of any kind of doctrine which says that a appellate court can tell what issues have been chosen to be asserted to it, put before it, by going back and looking at the decision of a... of a lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.368" offset="13725466">Here, the trial court in Oregon disposed of one of the Federal inappellate assistance of counsel claims, citing Jones against Barnes, but it had before it state law claims of inappellate... ineffective assistance of counsel, as well as Federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.259" offset="13788996">The trial court didn't mention the state claims, but they were all dismissed as well by the judgment that was ultimately entered at the trial court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.432" offset="13821701">So both state and Federal claims were dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.745" offset="13830896">You couldn't tell by looking at the trial court judgment what the... what the prisoner was choosing to actually assert among those dismissed claims at the court of appeals level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.012" offset="13876036">He could as well have been asserting his dismissed state ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</text>
