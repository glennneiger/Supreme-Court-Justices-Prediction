            <text syncTime="70.455" offset="281809">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="73.187" offset="292676">The Ninth Circuit found that the arrest at issue here was one unauthorized, false, and in violation of international law because it occurred in Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.541" offset="334158">Nonetheless, the court found inapplicable the exception in the Federal Tort Claims Act for claims arising in a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.299" offset="365192">At the same time, the court read the bare jurisdictional terms of section 1350 in title 28 to provide courts with the authority to infer causes of action from sources of customary international law, including treaties that the political branches have expressly refused to ratify.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.622" offset="438439">The resulting decision, which reads express grants of executive authority narrowly and implied grants of judicial authority broadly, turns the established separation of powers regime for dealing with international issues on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.592" offset="502282">The Ninth Circuit first construed executive authority narrowly by holding that the DEA agents lacked the authority to effect an arrest in Mexico or abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.870" offset="547422">That decision... that holding has several problems, not the least of which is that by its terms it would preclude Federal agents from making an arrest abroad even in circumstances where the foreign country consents or there is no foreign government that is functioning to provide consent.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.706" offset="690782">If we... if we pick one, is there one that is... that is more important to the Government than the others?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="178.241" offset="712934">--Well, regrettably, Justice Scalia, this is the rare case where I think they really are of quite significance because what the Ninth Circuit has held is, on the one hand, Federal agents, including the FBI, would lack the authority to make arrests abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.119" offset="764447">They've also ruled in a way that I think really reads the foreign country exemption out of the Federal Tort Claims Act and then, of course, on the 1350 issue, that is an issue of tremendous importance to the Government and also to the broader community.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.048" offset="816170">So I guess if--</text>

            <text syncTime="220.099" offset="880327">Now, Mr. Phillips is going to be covering just 1350 because that's the only issue that affects his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.895" offset="903523">But the United States is both the petitioner in the case that raises the Federal Tort Claims Act issue, but also a respondent in support of petitioner with respect to 1350.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.672" offset="942602">So it's an ambitious goal in... in 25 minutes, but I hope to address them both.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="240.797" offset="963187">Well, getting back to Justice Scalia's question, I... I suppose the President or the Attorney General could make an order with respect to extraterritorial arrests, and that would eliminate one rationale of the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.716" offset="1026821">Or am I wrong about that?</text>

            <text syncTime="257.577" offset="1030269">Well, I think you are wrong about that, Justice Kennedy, because as I read the ruling of the Ninth Circuit, they say that the President, the executive, the Attorney General lack the authority to make an extraterritorial arrest, and they specifically--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="275.802" offset="1103203">And they said even if it had the authority, it... it has to be from a high official.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.509" offset="1134028">There's a concurrence by, I think, five of the six justices in the majority that said at a minimum you'd need a high-ranking official, but the majority opinion that's the law of the Ninth Circuit is that regardless of who approves the operation, the President categorically lacks that authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.913" offset="1207589">Is... am I correct in thinking if we agree with you on... on that issue, that disposes of the entire case?</text>

            <text syncTime="309.688" offset="1238727">Now, I would say that it... the other issues in the case are logically in some respects anterior to that question, especially because the... for example, the section 1350 really is a question about the... the very jurisdiction of the courts.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="343.892" offset="1375504">Well, we'd have to be pretty ambitious because some of them weren't addressed below and they're contrary... the position being taken today is contrary to the position taken by previous Solicitors General.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.071" offset="1424196">I mean, it's kind of a new question.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.684" offset="1438720">I'm not sure it was even raised and argued below.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.765" offset="1455020">--Well, we think it was raised and argued below, Justice O'Connor, and I think the 1350 issue is of tremendous continuing importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.490" offset="1485949">I mean, if I could... if I could address the point that you raised about the change in position.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.704" offset="1502772">It is true that the United States in the Filartiga case took a different position.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.238" offset="1520849">Now, subsequent that... to that, the administration has... different administrations have taken the position that 1350 is just jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.456" offset="1553763">And if I could draw an analogy to the experience that this Court has had, in 1947 this Court upheld the constitutionality of State statutes that provided reciprocity in inheritance laws with foreign countries and said that was okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.624" offset="1610397">21 years later, with the... sort of benefit of hindsight and the experience with State court judges causing foreign policy problems, this Court in the Journing case revisited that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.374" offset="1657417">And in a similar way, I think the 20-years-plus experience that we've had with the Filartiga regime has made it quite clear that these lawsuits provide tremendous problems for the foreign policy interests of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.212" offset="1708826">And at the same time, in the intervening... intervening period, if anything, this Court has made it quite clear what the proper mode of finding a cause of action is and the proper way to read a jurisdictional provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.142" offset="1820526">But I think one thing that's important to emphasize is that the case doesn't have to go to judgment to create potential foreign policy problems for the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.379" offset="1857515">And to give you just one example, there's litigation that's ongoing... it hasn't gone to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.873" offset="1875487">It's quite preliminary... in New York right now, where people are seeking compensation for abuses that occurred during the apartheid regime in South Africa.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.170" offset="1908611">Now, the Government of South Africa itself, of course, has a very different mechanism for dealing with those issues, the truth and reconciliation process.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.577" offset="1942256">And the Government of South Africa has formally protested at the highest levels that these issues that are very difficult issues for that government and that government is dealing with are the subject of litigation in the United States courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.196" offset="1992725">And I think what you see is time and time again you have private litigants that may be very well intentioned but are focused on only a single issue and they are bringing that issue into the courts, creating foreign policy problems for the executive branch which the executive branch then has to try to remedy and ameliorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.269" offset="2065032">At the same time, in the process of those lawsuits, you have courts making pronouncements on principles of international law and customary international law that may well be at variance with the views of the executive branch or--</text>

            <text syncTime="671.962" offset="2687791">--Well, with respect, Justice Stevens, let me take that in a couple of steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.804" offset="2703151">First of all, I mean, certainly Judge Bork thought that maybe those original causes of action would be actionable in Federal court at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.452" offset="2737737">Now, first of all, to make clear, what the first Congress did is rather than pass any kind of tort action, it dealt with those three very offenses against the law of nations and dealt with them criminally.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.902" offset="2783608">Now, it may be that what Judge Bork had in mind is that at the time of the framing, as a matter of general common law in the pre-Erie sense, it might have been possible to get into Federal court and raise those three violations against the law of nations as a tort action.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.593" offset="2842331">I don't think, however, that authority would survive Erie in any event, and I think it raises some questions of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.837" offset="2871275">Now, I think you're absolutely right, though, Justice Stevens, to say that the one objection you would have to applying straightforwardly the principles that this Court has adopted in cases like Cort against Ash and Sandoval is that this statute was passed at a much earlier time and where the... the enacting Congress may have had different assumptions in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.720" offset="2946821">But this Court has made clear that it's not going to sort of tether its analysis to what assumptions the enacting Congress might have had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.545" offset="2978168">It did so, of course, in the Sandoval decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.618" offset="2986423">But you did so yourself, Justice Stevens, in your separate opinion in California against Sierra Club where you said that it may very well have been that the Congress in 1890 that passed the Rivers and Harbor Act probably assumed there would be a cause of action in court, but you said it was more important to apply the principles of Cort against Ash in that case than to try to divine the intent of an enacting Congress from 100 years earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="784.227" offset="3136888">Yes, this is a good thing, but it's... it's... we want to make it really clear that torture is a crime against humanity and we want to include U.S. citizens as plaintiffs as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="817.351" offset="3269381">That was just a codification decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="839.539" offset="3358093">What I would point to the Torture Victim Protection Act, though, is a model of why it makes sense to ask Congress to get involved in creating a cause of action because when it does, it provides clear direction to the court and also acts in a way that minimizes tensions with allies because you're absolutely right to suggest that torture is one of the most well-established norms of international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.537" offset="3450044">Yet, notwithstanding that, when Congress addressed the issue in the TVPA, it provided specific definitions of the prohibited conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.924" offset="3483690">Then it also provided clear guidance to the lower courts by providing for a specific statute of limitations of 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.680" offset="3514619">And then, as I also indicated, it... it put in a specific statutory exhaustion provision which suggested that litigants shouldn't rush to United States courts if the courts in the area where the events actually took place are open for the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.941" offset="3571670">I think that last provision is particularly telling because it shows that when you take the normal course and insist that Congress get involved in the process of creating causes of action, Congress as a political branch with foreign affairs responsibilities of its own--</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="922.670" stopTime="978.860">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="922.670" offset="3690580">--Well, Justice Stevens, there certainly are international jurists that will argue that exhaustion principles are a principle of international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.516" offset="3722031">But I think that's exactly what ends up happening if you leave these issues to the courts and don't insist on a cause of action is you leave the courts as a matter of Federal common law, I guess, trying to interpret international law sources to come up with things like exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.969" offset="3787860">A statute of limitations I would think would be even more difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.291" offset="3801130">Principles of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.580" offset="3806250">And they're supposed to do all of that as a matter of Federal common lawmaking with the only guide they have in the text is the 33 words in 28 U.S.C. 1350 which, by their terms, really only address jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.469" offset="3857868">So I think that would put the courts in a very difficult position, and I think in contrast, the Torture Victim Protection Act shows the virtues of waiting for Congress to take some action before somebody would get involved in this kind of situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="996.814" offset="3987226">Yes, Justice Kennedy, and thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.375" offset="3993496">Let me start with the... the arrest authority question because, as I said at the outset, the view of the Ninth Circuit is that there is categorically no arrest authority abroad, even if a foreign nation consents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.344" offset="4041352">And that really cannot be correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.276" offset="4049084">And I think respondent recognizes that implicitly by not defending that aspect of the Ninth Circuit ruling, but rather insisting on a rule that would give arrest authority only with consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.053" offset="4088163">And with respect, though, I think that is not a workable rule for the Federal courts, and if I could use, by way of example, the arrest of the individual who's the convicted killer in the CIA shooting, Mir Aimal Kasi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.331" offset="4137273">This is an individual who was arrested by FBI agents in Pakistan in 1997.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.355" offset="4161411">Under the Ninth Circuit's approach, obviously, this individual could not be arrested by FBI agents as a categorical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.611" offset="4190354">But under the approach of respondent, the Federal courts would have to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the arrest and to inquire specifically into whether the Government of Pakistan consented to the arrest by FBI agents in Pakistan in 1997.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.110" offset="4256392">Now, I think the prospects for interfering with sensitive diplomatic relations, not to mention the difficulty of divining any principles for discerning the requisite degree of consent, are manifest in both those cases, and I would suggest that the far better approach is to read section 878 of title 21, consistent with its plain terms, to give the DEA the arrest authority for any felony cognizable under the laws of the United States without reading in either a territorial limitation or a limitation based on consent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1100.444" offset="4401737">That was... when Congress looked at this, they restricted DEA agents' authority, not granted it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1108.331" offset="4433293">With respect, Justice Ginsburg, I actually think the Mansfield Amendment supports the view of the United States here, and indeed, under the view of the Ninth Circuit, it's entirely unclear what the Mansfield Amendment was supposed to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.808" offset="4483135">It was under their view limiting an authority that did not exist because what the Mansfield Amendment does is put specific limitations on the authority of Federal agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.514" offset="4522005">It applies only to direct arrests, only to foreign police actions, and only in the context of narcotics control efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.051" offset="4552202">And then even there it provides specific exceptions for exigencies and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.667" offset="4574668">And so I think what that reflects is that there may be circumstances where an extraterritorial arrest authority raises concerns and Congress may react to those, as it did in the Mansfield Amendment, but the very fact that there is this specific and tailored limitation on DEA authority suggests that there must be some broader grant of authority that includes extraterritorial arrests.</text>

            <text syncTime="1187.671" offset="4750629">And I think there's two implications from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.814" offset="4759197">One is, of course, if that's the way you read it, the Mansfield Amendment certainly doesn't bar the action here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1197.230" offset="4788872">But here's why I think it still implies something about the scope of section 878 because section 878 of title 21 is not just the authority for the DEA to make arrests, it's basically the source of all their statutory authority for law enforcement efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.782" offset="4847073">And I think that even participation in the midst of a foreign police action, as you were envisioning the reference in the Mansfield Amendment, is at least a law enforcement involvement of the DEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.590" offset="4890331">And so I think that unless 878 authorizes extraterritorial actions by DEA agents, be it arrests, be it simply carrying a firearm, or be it engaging in other investigatory activities, then so too I think the language of the Mansfield Amendment, even if it limits the very specific kind of law enforcement activity by the DEA, still suggests that 878 by its terms is not strictly limited to the territory of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1269.032" offset="5076114">If I could say just a... a few things about the foreign country exemption before I sit down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.678" offset="5098684">I think that there is a very clear error in the analysis of the Ninth Circuit because this is really a... a rare case where you have an arrest that is false and tortious only because it occurred in Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.856" offset="5147376">You have the lower courts recognizing that the plaintiff is entitled to damages only for the period he was in Mexico, and every element of the tort took place in Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.644" offset="5186560">Yet, nonetheless, somehow the court applies this headquarters doctrine to say that the foreign country exception applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.960" offset="5215817">And I think what that illustrates is that although the headquarters exception may have been a helpful gloss on the language of the statute when it was first developed, as it's been interpreted by the Ninth Circuit, it becomes a free-floating exception to the... to the foreign country exception that allows a plaintiff to skirt the language of the statute simply by alleging any degree of U.S. involvement or direction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1375.873" offset="5503478">But the truth is, as one of the amicus briefs for the respondents points out, there are at least 35 cases that they cite in their briefs that have been filed under section 1350.</text>

            <text syncTime="2647.298" offset="10589100">--Well, what they did is they asked the... the States to enforce the law of nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.581" offset="10610312">And Connecticut passed that particular statute in order to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.374" offset="10625463">Other States did not act in response to that, but that's not to suggest that they didn't decide that they already had adequate remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.471" offset="10657855">Moreover, the resolution did more than just ask the States to enforce the law of nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.907" offset="10687530">It also provided a new... which was not a common law thing... an indemnity for the United States if the United States had to do something to take up the slack for the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.476" offset="10729848">And so from our standpoint, what... what the... the 1781 resolution really does is that is the... the step is from 1781, feeling completely frustrated and not able to enforce the law of nations, coming to the Constitution where there's lots of evidence that the Founding Fathers believed that we had to as a Nation enforce the law of nations, having incidents like the Marbois incident and the... the attack on the ambassador in New York right before them, deciding in the alien tort statute to make those claims available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.871" offset="10871432">Now, what... what the Government and... and Petitioner Sosa want the Court to believe is that having gone through the trouble of expressing to the world, to the people, in terms of the... that... that we would as a Nation enforce the law of nations, that then the Congress just didn't do it because basically Congress didn't do anything else to enforce the torts in violation of the law of nations clause of the Judiciary Act of 1789.</text>

            <text syncTime="2784.508" offset="11137985">On the first one, in terms of whether the law of nations is too indeterminate... boundless I think is the word that's used in the petitioner's brief... this Court has affirmed at least in... on two occasions that I'm aware of, in U.S. v. Smith and in Ex parte Quirin, the fact that Congress can easily by reference incorporate the law of nations and that it is not indeterminate enough to justify a death sentence in the... against the pirate in the United States v.

            <text syncTime="2819.521" offset="11278002">The Court... it is perfectly permissible for the Congress, particularly in 1789, to incorporate by reference what lawyers at that time knew to be the law of nations.</text>

            <text syncTime="4778.612" offset="19114423">He was so upset by the fact that it was a clear violation of law, but we nevertheless would give the defense act of state doctrine to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.768" offset="19143053">But you may be right, but that's my... it was my recollection of the opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="4789.640" offset="19158518">My point I guess would be, though, that where there is diversity among nations or about the norm, then I don't think they can be forced... enforced within the alien tort statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.305" offset="19197179">And I think that in the South Africa case, for example, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if that would be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4806.130" offset="19224451">It's... I think there's a motion to dismiss pending, and it may be that... that that's the kind of case that ought not to be in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.276" offset="19245035">I don't know much about the details of it, so it's very hard to make that kind of comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4815.900" offset="19263530">But you know, I think that there are... there are doctrines that the Court has, both domestically and internationally, to make sure that these problems don't become the kind of problems that are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.900" offset="19323507">And if they are problems, they can be remedied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4834.632" offset="19338449">They can be remedied by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.705" offset="19346808">And it seems to us that that's where... that's where the decision should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.119" offset="19368438">I see that my time is up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.740" offset="19378887">And the... the closing remark I... I would make really is that in... in Ker v. Illinois in 1886, this Court denied a remedy to someone who had been kidnapped from another country and said that he could be tried notwithstanding that violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.866" offset="19459448">The Court also said that that person would not be without a remedy, that all that person had to do was bring a suit for trespass and false arrest, and the Court was sure that that statement would provide a remedy in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4883.526" offset="19534054">After Dr. Alvarez's acquittal, he took up the Court on that suggestion that he might get a remedy under the statutes that Congress has... where Congress has authorized the courts to provide redress for... for those kinds of torts and for those kinds of violations of the law of nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.899" offset="19615556">And to... all that we are asking from this Court and all we asked in the courts below is that the courts perform the kinds of functions that courts have performed for hundreds of years before the republic, all during the republic in providing a damage remedy for the violation of personal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.733" offset="19694864">And upholding the modest judgment in this case is not going to undermine our national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="4932.018" offset="19727987">It will only affirm the values that have made the... the country as great as it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4938.484" offset="19753900">Thank you very much.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="4944.147" offset="19776575">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4945.727" offset="19782844">If I could first address the argument that is advanced by respondent that we can solve the extraterritorial arrest problem by simply insisting on there being consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.022" offset="19820042">I think this Court in its first Alvarez-Machain opinion at footnote 16 made the point that there are some issues that are best dealt with in diplomatic relations between countries and not in the courts of a single party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.092" offset="19872287">And I think consent for an extraterritorial arrest is a prototypical example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.325" offset="19893290">In diplomatic relations between countries, a certain amount of ambiguity can make the diplomatic relation function and so there may be varying degrees of consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.313" offset="19933205">In the context of a United States judicial proceeding, though, the tendency is to bore down and find out whether there was some modicum of consent, some legal standard of consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.461" offset="19973747">And I would point again to the example of Mir Aimal Kasi as how having courts bear down and figure out the exact extent of consent between Pakistan and FBI agents in 1997 would not have been a productive exercise for the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.741" offset="20030903">A very brief note on the Ker opinion, Ker against Illinois that was just mentioned at the closing of respondents' argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.786" offset="20055144">It's true the Court said that there might be an action for kidnapping in that case, but this Court did not opine in any way what would be the relevant law in that kidnapping that occurred in Peru.</text>
            <text syncTime="5024.322" offset="20097254">I would suggest if it had looked at that issue, it would have suggested that the law that applied would be the law of Peru in the same way that if there is any law that applies to the false arrest here, it is the law of Mexico and that only underscores that this arrest, even if it were actionable somehow, would fall within the foreign country exemption to the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5044.253" offset="20176980">If I could say two things about section 1350.</text>
            <text syncTime="5047.596" offset="20190354">The... first of all, in terms of trying to divine exactly what was in Congress' mind when it enacted this provision in 1789, I would say that that is exceedingly difficult and that strongly suggests that what the Court should do is simply apply its rules for when there is a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5066.149" offset="20264542">But if there is any agreement at all as to what at least one of the events that led to the passage of the statute was, it was the events involving ambassadors in the United States and violations and assaults on those ambassadors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5079.869" offset="20319399">And I think the reaction to those assaults is telling.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.039" offset="20332147">First, there were no civil actions ever brought in the courts that anybody is aware of to remedy those actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5088.634" offset="20354508">What were brought are common law criminal actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5091.866" offset="20367464">That's what the Longchamps case in Pennsylvania was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.069" offset="20380212">It was a common law criminal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5096.942" offset="20387736">Now, I don't think anybody would suggest that a common law criminal action in law of nations somehow survives this Court... this Court's decision in Hudson, saying there's no longer any common law criminal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.368" offset="20441443">In the same way, to the extent that the Court... the Congress may have had in mind some general common law action that was available, there's no particular reason why that decision should withstand the Erie decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5122.827" offset="20491285">But again, I think it is noteworthy that there was no civil action in response to those incidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.091" offset="20512287">What there was is the 1781 Continental Congress action, and it just didn't ask the court... the State courts to do something about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5136.318" offset="20545202">It told the courts to authorize actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5139.110" offset="20556382">The one court... the one State that took up the challenge was Connecticut, and if you look at what Connecticut did, it is very telling because first they put in a jurisdictional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.525" offset="20598073">Then as a separate provision, they used language that is rights-conferring language.</text>
            <text syncTime="5154.760" offset="20618971">It seems obvious that Congress with section 1350 did the former but not the latter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5160.634" offset="20642482">There is jurisdiction, but there is not any rights-creating language.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.518" offset="20662021">Now, it may be a bit anomalous to apply this Court's current conception to an old statute like the Judiciary Act of 1789, but this Court has done it before.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.573" offset="20694204">Thank you.</text>
