            <text syncTime="1603.167" offset="6412643">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In the free exercise context, this Court has held that the minimum requirement of neutrality is that a law not discriminate on its face</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.216" offset="6472829">That's clearly what is taking place here, and I'd like to put in context exactly how the implementation of the statutory program works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.896" offset="6503549">Washington, when they adopted the Promise Scholarship program and how it's applied, works this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.848" offset="6523298">A student applies for this general grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.191" offset="6536673">In this particular case, Josh Davey applied for the grant when he was aware of it in the summer, was notified by the state that he was qualified and accepted in the program in August.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.874" offset="6583484">At that point he enrolled at Northwest College, which is an accredited and eligible institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.614" offset="6606367">It was not until...  and he declared his major, the dual major, at that point in business administration and the pastoral ministries degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.423" offset="6633639">Two months later, it was two months until he was notified by the financial aid office through a memorandum that the state circulated that after reviewing the Promise Scholarship program, the state then decided that in fact there would be a prohibition put in place on pursuing a degree in theology and that state has interpreted that to mean pursuing a degree in theology from a religious perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.086" offset="6724336">The check, Justice O'Connor, is sent directly to the student.</text>

            <text syncTime="2463.952" offset="9855791">The reason those details matter because the line drawing albeit may be crude on the State of Washington, here is within the context of the Free Exercise Clause, because here the school is an eligible institution, so that's not even at issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3319.484" offset="13277936">Yeah, but the Court went on to say that this was a free exercise violation as well as a First Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.519" offset="13297998">The other point that I think is very, very important with respect to that, if the state starts to distinguishing between discussion of a subject and proselytizing, the entanglement problem is going to be enormous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.029" offset="13348049">The program will have to be looked at to see how persuasive it is.</text>

            <text syncTime="3352.383" offset="13409489">No, because the line has been drawn by individuals, individuals making genuinely free, independent choices to make a dispensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.178" offset="13444702">It's like the Court's example in those cases of an individual receiving a check and then deciding exactly how to spend it so there's a great difference between those kind of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3383.591" offset="13534354">I would like to return to three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.535" offset="13558073">One, on the statute that says no aid shall be awarded to a student pursuing a degree in theology.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.101" offset="13584300">A question was asked saying that for administrative ease the state uses this legislative approach, their constitutional command.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.274" offset="13617006">But it's not just administrative ease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.215" offset="13624842">I think it's a question of entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.868" offset="13631425">Should the state be involved in a class-by-class assessment of whether it...  it individually, it should be categorized as religious instruction or not.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="3416.496" stopTime="3422.152">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="3416.496" offset="13665907">But we've held in Witters that there is no problem with that...  with that kind...  with that kind of subsidy.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="narda_pierce" startTime="3422.152" stopTime="3558.788">
            <label>Ms. Narda Pierce</label>
            <text syncTime="3422.152" offset="13688581">For purposes of the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.465" offset="13697776">And I just wanted to point out that our state supreme court has questioned in a dissent in the Gallway v. Grimm case, some justices of our state supreme court have asked, is focusing on the degree program sufficient for our state constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.645" offset="13762560">But we believe there are good reasons for it that's not yet been addressed by our court, and that's to avoid that kind of class-by-class determination, not necessary in Witters because there the focus is, does the Establishment Clause...  is it violated by government endorsement?</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.794" offset="13823164">But Washington does take a different approach to both prongs, both twin prongs of religious freedom, and this is my second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.390" offset="13853466">For purposes of funding, it looks beyond government endorsement and looks to the freedom of conscience in religious matters of a broader range of citizens, including citizens who may not want to have their compelled tax payments used for religious instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.480" offset="13921907">So it's the same principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.800" offset="13927131">It doesn't become hostility to religion just because it extends that one principle beyond what the Establishment Clause requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.852" offset="13959314">On the other hand, the State of Washington also puts greater restrictions on government where their regulations may impact someone's free exercise of their religion so that unless a state...  the state can show a substantial need, certain regulatory laws cannot be applied in a fashion that burdened the free exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.664" offset="14038622">The Munns v. Martin case is a classic example that we have cited to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.008" offset="14051997">It's a case where historic landmark laws could not prevent a church from building a pastoral center because the historic landmark laws were deemed not to be substantially needed by the state to protect the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.344" offset="14105287">So we do think there is wide latitude, and my final point, Mr. Chief Justice, is that this Court has accorded the states wide latitude in funding decisions for the states to make their own policy judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.726" offset="14154815">Here, all the state has done has been to decline to fund religious instruction wherever it occurs, including in a theology degree program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.385" offset="14193476">We have not overstepped our bounds by imposing an unconstitutional condition on Mr. Davey as a recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.983" offset="14223882">In the overall picture, we're not suppressing...</text>
