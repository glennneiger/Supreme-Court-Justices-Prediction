            <text syncTime="230.177" offset="920660">We... I think we need to go back to what Belton was all about.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.578" offset="1002266">And the Belton rule itself says, quote, at page 460, when a policeman has made a lawful arrest of the occupants of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.626" offset="1070498">Belton was focusing on that highly dangerous situation when a police officer initiates contact with and approaches a... an occupied vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.048" offset="1116160">As this Court recognized in Pennsylvania v. Mimms, that may be the most highly dangerous situation an officer faces.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.711" offset="1298808">When they arrested him, yes, but not when they search... do the search.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.161" offset="1316571">--I would agree with that 100 percent, Your Honor, but the converse of that position is that in order to do the search, the... that he's allowed to do under the Fourth Amendment, that... that right to search fixes at the moment he effects the custodial arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.361" offset="1381355">You don't want to... or it's not reasonable to require the officer to conduct that search with the suspect at his elbow.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.164" offset="1412598">So while I would agree with Your Honor as a... as a very practical matter, there is no danger to the officer in the situation where the man is arrested, stuffed in the back of the squad car, and then we go search, that's kind of a fiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.015" offset="1476023">But on the other hand, it may be a kind of a reasonable fiction because otherwise, the converse is, if the officer is going to search the car, he's got to do it with Mr. Thornton or Mr. Belton standing right beside him.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.628" offset="1530462">And that's why--</text>

            <text syncTime="1605.955" offset="6423719">The sole contention advanced by petitioner on appeal was that the search of his car was not lawful under the rule of New York v. Belton because Officer Nichols did not succeed in initiating contact with him while he was still inside his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.225" offset="6484846">The court of appeals correctly rejected that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.595" offset="6498325">To begin with, petitioner's initiation of contact rule has no foundation in the rationale of Belton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.786" offset="6523089">It is the fact of the arrest and not the reason that the person exited the car that gives rise to the justification for the Belton search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.938" offset="6555690">The custodial arrest is an extremely dangerous and volatile encounter for the officer in the field, and that's particularly true in the case of the arrest of a recent occupant of a vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.193" offset="6600725">In Belton, this Court drew the generalization that when the recent occupant of a vehicle is arrested, that the inside of the vehicle is always within the area in which that occupant might try to... try to lunge in order to get a weapon to effect his escape or to grab evidence to conceal it or destroy it in the car.</text>

            <text syncTime="1722.051" offset="6888176">And that's a critical point for the Court to understand in weighing the... the petitioner's reaching distance argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.928" offset="6911687">This Court knows what the world is like in a reaching distance regime under Chimel and the important context in which the recent occupant of a car is arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.057" offset="6948153">As the Court mentioned in... in Belton, it's a world in which there's disarray and confusion in the case law, more litigation and more confusion for the officer in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.067" offset="6988173">The Court noted on page 460 of its decision in Belton that that kind of confusion was not helpful to the police who need clear rules for the scope of their authority in this context.</text>

            <text syncTime="2624.363" offset="10497358">The inventory search I don't think is an answer to the officer's safety concerns and justification for Belton, which are real as long as the person is still at the scene of the arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2640.215" offset="10560784">There's also the risk, as... as you mentioned I think, that there could be confederates in the area who might try to get into the car, either for a weapon or to get drugs out of the car or other contraband out of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.538" offset="10602057">Officers in... in the Belton stop, it's not uncommon for them to... to have the person out of the car, to secure him, and then it's only at that point that they... that they feel safe to go back to make sure that there's no one else in the car who could be hidden in the car or other things in the car.</text>

            <text syncTime="3014.549" offset="12058122">--Well, and... and that's... that's a different fact pattern that has arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.414" offset="12077558">We think Belton would apply in that situation, and police we think have reasonably concluded that and courts have reasonably concluded that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.783" offset="12107128">But... but that's not the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.988" offset="12119876">And the most important question for the Court to answer, which is the situation where the police do see the person get out of the car and do confront him moments later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.720" offset="12154880">The... the States... a number of States have filed an amicus brief in this case supporting the Government's position and... and urging against adoption of an initiation of contact rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.442" offset="12197721">And... and we do think it's significant that each of the States and jurisdictions that have adopted the initiation of contact rule, States like Florida and... and Illinois and Michigan, have signed that brief and urged the Court to reject the initiation of contact rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.713" offset="12258847">We think that that rule is unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.087" offset="12268251">It's shown to be unworkable in cases like Gant v. Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.039" offset="12284134">There are other cases in which added wrinkles have been applied to the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.233" offset="12304927">There's a Florida case, which is not discussed in the briefs, but it is publicly reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.861" offset="12327393">It's Kavallierakis v. State, 790 S. 2d 1201.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.493" offset="12345887">In that case, the courts in Florida, applying the initiation of contact rule, concluded that in order to trigger Belton, the contact had to be of a confrontational nature and not of a friendly nature, so that in that case, the courts reversed a conviction for possession of drugs found in a car because the police officer met the person with a greeting while he was getting out of the car as opposed to a confrontational signal such as a... as a siren or a light.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.009" offset="12459990">Now, that... that seems like an extreme application of that rule, but it's nevertheless indicative of... of the variations in the line-drawing that can arise and that have arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.172" offset="12496666">In this case we think that the court of appeals properly held that Belton apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.954" offset="12515788">The record conclusively shows that petitioner was a recent occupant of the car and the search was contemporaneous with the... the arrest, and we would ask the Court to affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank W. Dunham, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3143.396" offset="12573571">I have four brief points, Your Honor, that I'd like to make, if I could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.412" offset="12589558">The first is that the State court opinion in Michigan v. Long, People v.... People v. Long, shows that the car there was being chased by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.003" offset="12631980">They just weren't observing him drive by at a high rate of speed and crash into a ditch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.102" offset="12648385">They were in a high-speed chase, and it's reasonable to infer that they had their lights on and therefore had initiated contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.559" offset="12674194">Furthermore, the State court opinion in People v. Long shows that Long was in the vehicle when the officers got out of their car, after he had crashed into the ditch, and began to approach the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.919" offset="12715572">Then Long exited his vehicle and walked towards the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.520" offset="12729992">So I don't think it's... it's fair to say that there was no initiation of contact by the officers with Long in the Long case and that the footnote in the Long opinion referencing to Belton is no expansion or further brightening of the Belton rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.799" offset="12799164">Second, I want to point out that the Frick case, which is the one possible exception that I think Justice Stevens referred to when he was talking about the cases that Belton points to as defining its class... the man is either getting into or getting out of his vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.674" offset="12858619">He has not... he has not achieved the status of pedestrian.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.523" offset="12874083">Most people... I think you could still consider someone who was in the act of either getting in or getting out... you could call that person an occupant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.509" offset="12905953">Third, if you... the Fourth Circuit did not adopt Mr. Garre's place where he would have occupied if he had been arrested test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.489" offset="12941897">We call... that's the Government's might have test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.410" offset="12953600">But Mr. Garre would add that to what the Fourth Circuit rule and would have him... and... and would add a limit that, oh, as long as he's arrested where he might have been if he might have been arrested, if we'd stopped him when he was getting out of his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.785" offset="13011069">It seems to me that that is an unworkable rule and it just adds further confusion to the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.326" offset="13037296">Yet, it's necessary, necessary because it's the only way you avoid reversing Chimel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.936" offset="13059657">Now, the... the other point I want to make is Justice O'Connor I think made a good point about the inventory search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.092" offset="13088287">Why can't we draw Belton narrowly because in 90 percent of the cases, we're going to have an inventory search anyway?</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.382" offset="13113469">And why can't we maintain some semblance of Fourth Amendment protection in automobiles?</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.934" offset="13143667">And finally, with regard to the handcuffs point, Mr. Garre's point that people sometimes get out of their handcuffs, I'd simply like to say if we indulge in the presumption that suspects are going to get out of their handcuffs, there's simply no search incident to arrest rule that we can fashion that doesn't just have us searching everyplace on God's green earth.</text>
