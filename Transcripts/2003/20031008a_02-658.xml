            <text syncTime="12.965" offset="51827">The question in this case is whether the Federal Environmental Protection Agency has the legal authority to override by fiat a discretionary determination that Congress expressly directed be made instead by the State of Alaska, which Congress trusted to exercise its own independent judgment according to local priorities and local conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.315" offset="133224">We submit that the answer to that question is no.</text>

            <text syncTime="79.134" offset="316500">Now, can EPA, under the statute, say, Alaska, you just didn't follow the required procedures?</text>

I would have thought a much more rational interpretation of the statute is that, yes, the State has certain obligations under the statute to consider the factors, but if they were not considered, the person who would bring them to account for not considering them is initially the State courts and then, on certiorari, to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3175.579" offset="12702302">We care that a court does and not EPA acting at any time by fiat according to any information that it may have at... at... on the basis of what it thinks may or may not be reasonable or unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.640" offset="12746501">The point of the matter is, is that the State procedures are fully adequate to address any concerns that EPA has raised here, and its injecting itself into the process, disrupting the orderly process... and, Justice Stevens, the record would be different and it would be different because Alaska law allows, when a party has properly objected, for a de novo administrative hearing, at which the agency is allowed to present additional evidence, witnesses, and further refine and clarify its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.057" offset="12864157">If there was any legitimate concern as to whether the State's decision wasn't clear, as it should have been, that is the manner in which it should have been resolved, through the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.139" offset="12900519">And we are confident that it would have been resolved there, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.112" offset="12912431">That's where the back and forth would have occurred, not in the manner of here where we're now 4 years later and we still don't have a decision as to what technology this company can use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.060" offset="12952137">And finally, Your Honors, the... the point of the matter is there's no legitimate dispute here that the result of Alaska's decision is cleaner air and that cannot be unreasonable.</text>
