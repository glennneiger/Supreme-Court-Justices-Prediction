            <text syncTime="71.235" offset="284839">The rule this Court announced in Ring did not change what is to be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.652" offset="326531">It only changed who decides.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.193" offset="340741">It did not make any conduct... it did not decriminalize any conduct, nor did it make any defendant ineligible for the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.604" offset="410331">We agree with all the State and Federal appellate courts that have looked to determine whether Apprendi or Ring should apply retroactively and concluded that the Apprendi/Ring rule is not the sort of ground-breaking rule that overcomes this Court's Teague bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="129.952" offset="519732">Mr. Todd, could we go back to what you opened with, that you said this is just a... and you emphasized this throughout your brief... it's only a who decides, not what.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.870" offset="559438">But I thought that the notion in Ring is that it adds elements to the offense that were not there before.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.009" offset="611997">So now you have aggravating factors is an element of the offense, and by so characterizing it, other things happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.824" offset="647210">It has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt on the aggravating or the other aggravating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.390" offset="689528">You would have whatever you have to prove elements; that is, you... the confrontation clause would apply, everything that goes with making it as part of the substantive crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.631" offset="742504">It's not just a question of, well, before it was the judge and now it's the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.832" offset="759327">Because it's part of the substantive crime, other things go along with it too, don't... don't they?</text>

            <text syncTime="222.203" offset="888790">It... it didn't change the substantive reach of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.408" offset="1209574">But the... the key question... I mean, the key fact is that the underlying conduct, the... has not changed at all, that the aggravators are the same today as they were before Ring.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.305" offset="1261192">The... it has the conduct... the reach of the statute hasn't changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.439" offset="1277701">All we're talking about is applying the Sixth Amendment guarantee to these aggravators that the Arizona put into their sentencing statute as a result from this Court's opinion in Furman.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.850" offset="1407373">It's... the argument that it's substantive, which is... imagine you have a statute that says if you use a gun in connection with a drug sale, it's a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.888" offset="1451468">All right?</text>
            <text syncTime="364.318" offset="1457215">And then this Court says that doesn't mean the drug in the... the gun is in the attic.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.253" offset="1476963">you know, the gun is in the attic... that doesn't count.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.214" offset="1484800">That's clearly substantive, isn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_pressley_todd" startTime="372.944" stopTime="374.296">

            <text syncTime="374.857" offset="1499324">Now, suppose they have a subpart (b) which said if the gun is in the attic, you get more, but the gun in the attic will be found by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.242" offset="1532865">That's just as if those words, gun in the attic, weren't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.804" offset="1551151">So it's just like the first statute, and that's Apprendi, you see.</text>

I think that the... that this Court's discussion in Bousley or Bousley... as... as you were indicating based on the Bailey decision, sort of capsulizes where... what... what in terms of retroactivity analysis, where substantive... what... what a real substantive change is.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.849" offset="1819376">The... this Court does not construe State statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.923" offset="1843618">State courts do that, and it's our position that in order to change the substance of a crime, this is something either that the legislative body must do or that the State court, in the case of a State--</text>

            <text syncTime="503.240" offset="2012891">I... if I read your cases correct, Justice Stevens, I believe that you have decided three cases since Teague in which you have found that the... there was a problem, unconstitutional problem, with a jury sentencing procedure in a capital case and you have found that those cases are Teague barred.</text>

            <label>Mr. John Pressley Todd</label>
            <text syncTime="539.683" offset="2158655">My recollection, Justice Stevens, is that in each of those cases there had been a prior holding by this Court finding some unconstitutional procedure and that the case was in these three cases that procedure existed, only they had... they were on collateral review and this Court found them Teague barred.</text>

            <text syncTime="563.330" offset="2253218">In our opinion, the only way that Mr. Summerlin can avoid this Court's Teague bar is if somehow he can find that the Apprendi/Ring rule fits within the exception for watershed changes in the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.099" offset="2364395">And as this Court recalls, in order to do that, the Ring/Apprendi rule must meet two tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.034" offset="2404101">It must satisfy two tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.475" offset="2413819">The first test is it must enhance the accuracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.698" offset="2430746">The second test is it must alter this Court's understanding of some bedrock principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.503" offset="2465959">Now, as to the... the first test, we would suggest that this Court's line of cases from 1968 answer the first question in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.496" offset="2541923">That is, that the Sixth Amendment jury guarantee and cases arising out of that are not to be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.633" offset="2590511">As you... as you recall in Duncan v. Louisiana in 1968, this Court for the first time held that the Sixth Amendment jury guarantee should be applied to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.493" offset="2649966">And in that very case... in that very case, this Court said that judge trials are not inherently unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.872" offset="2691448">Then a month later in DeStefano v. Woods, this Court decided and held that this right, this very right to have a jury trial, would not be applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.912" offset="2767621">And then in a series of cases after that, this Court... that in cases where the... the right arose out of the jury guarantee... this case... the Court did not apply those cases retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.654" offset="2838570">At the time when the military was... had a right to a jury for a civil offense that the person committed, this Court held that that would not be applied retroactively.</text>

            <text syncTime="1143.564" offset="4574250">With respect to the bedrock principles... that is... that is, the bedrock watershed rules that come within the second Teague exception... the Court has articulated that exception not in terms of any rule that carries out a principle of the Constitution, even an important rule that carries out a principle of the Constitution, or one of the amendments that have been incorporated, but rather a bedrock rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.620" offset="4674456">And the examples that the Court has given, which are things like the violation of the rule of Gideon against Wainwright or a mob dominating a trial or the knowing use of testimony that was... of a... of a confession that was extracted by torture I think give guidance as to what that sort of bedrock rule is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.510" offset="4741956">And what it is, is those are elements that, if they exist in a criminal trial, you can look at that trial and say this was not... could not have been a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.316" offset="4773198">In fact, the trial conceivably could have come to the right result, but it couldn't have been a fair trial if those elements were not satisfied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1228.659" offset="4914573">And accordingly, the law at that time was that and it would have to satisfy the Teague second exception if it were to be applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1294.096" offset="5176320">The question in these cases was things that the legislature had... was at the margins, things that the legislature had set forth not as an element of the offense, but as a sentencing factor that only goes to sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.891" offset="5223549">And what those cases did is divide up the... the universe of things that just go to sentencing and say some of them have to be submitted to the jury and others don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.488" offset="5257927">Those kinds of line-drawing decisions are not the kinds of things that are... that you can look at the commission of that particular fact to a judge rather than a jury and say this proceeding couldn't have been a fair one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1426.323" offset="5705247">The definition of those facts is a substantive point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.714" offset="5714756">And the reason for that is that in Bousley, what the Court said was a... a longstanding concern of Federal habeas is that someone is going to stand convicted of an offense based on conduct that the law does not make criminal or does not subject to the punishment that he's going to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.025" offset="5784033">Now, when a court comes to a new understanding of an element of... of what the meaning, the substantive meaning, of an element of an offense, what conduct is or isn't criminal or can or cannot be subject to a particular punishment, there is a risk that... that the defendant, who was tried under a different standard, does stand convicted of committing an act that the law didn't make criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.419" offset="5869610">And that's why substantive rules don't come within Teague.</text>

            <text syncTime="1547.172" offset="6188617">But I don't think the Court should reach that result for the reasons I just said, which is as a matter of substance and procedure, I think you can... if the question is, is this an element or is it a sentencing factor, but in both cases it's something that the legislature intended to set aside as this is something that's going to trigger a particular penalty, in this case the eligibility for the death penalty, either way I don't think that's a substantive decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.017" offset="6284016">If the question is, as it was in Bousley or in the... the Bailey case, well, is mere possession of a gun a criminal act or do you have... or is something else, is it something narrower than that, it has to be active use of the gun, that is a substantive decision because there are defendants who might have been found to have just possessed the gun and... and therefore not to be guilty of any crime at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.741" offset="6374922">And that does tie into a core purpose of habeas as... as the Court articulated in the Bousley case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.687" offset="6402717">The Court has said in... said in Tyler... to return to the... the bedrock, the second Teague exception, the Court said in Tyler and... v.

            <text syncTime="1621.299" offset="6485159">That exception is a narrow one because States have very vital interests in the finality of criminal convictions and in coming to closure after there's been a criminal conviction based on a good faith interpretation and reasonable interpretation of existing law, that not having to constantly reopen criminal convictions as the law naturally develops, as it does with respect to the jury trial right or any of the other rights that have been incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.177" offset="6584633">Applying that standard, the... the decision in Ring and the decision in... in Apprendi also, shouldn't be applied... don't come within the Teague second exception because it cannot be said in those circumstances that the... that the trial, in violation of those rules, was necessarily... couldn't have been a fair trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1706.274" offset="6825064">And this Court has done that before in Stringer v. Black, the only case that we are aware of where you were looking at jury instructions to whether they're old and new.</text>

            <text syncTime="2821.217" offset="11284793">But for a misunderstanding of how the system in Arizona worked, this Court... had this Court been presented with, for example, the information the Arizona Supreme Court gave in Ring I when they explained that in the Arizona system the aggravating circumstances do serve the eligibility purpose that they are an essential statutory factual element, then had you had that before Walton, had you had that information, Walton would have resulted in a different opinion is our position because you would have known then what you acknowledged in Ring, that we're not talking about jury sentencing in capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.603" offset="11442364">We're talking about making determination of eligibility for the death penalty itself with these aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.800" offset="11471099">And I would point out this is heinous, cruel, and depraved aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.240" offset="11488862">It isn't one... and this goes back a little bit to accuracy, but it isn't one that everybody necessarily agrees on because the prosecutor himself, the initial prosecutor in this case, did not, as the court in the Ninth Circuit points out, believe that there was enough evidence to support the heinous, cruel, and depraved circumstance... aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.513" offset="11570051">But that--</text>

            <text syncTime="2893.324" offset="11573290">Why... why should that be a factor that we take into consideration?</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.487" offset="11585933">I mean, surely there could be a difference between prosecutors and the fact that somebody in the DA's office thought there wasn't evidence... enough evidence to go ahead, shouldn't be crucial in deciding whether the finding was correct made by the court or by the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2911.125" offset="11644447">--It just, Your Honor, goes to the fact that if two people on the government's side of the case are disagreeing on it, then it just shows the absolute need and the... the essential character of the jury's role in determining the community's sense of whether such an aggravating factor did exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.516" offset="11709962">Now, if I can just continue on the old versus the new then, what happened then was that given the understanding of the... how the Arizona court worked, this Court went back to... to the basics of determining that every element of an offense, in this case capital murder, must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and the State is not able to rely upon mere labels or, you know, drafting of the sentence... of the statutes to give a different determination to what those aggravating circumstances are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.412" offset="11861577">And so this is really back consistent with Mullaney and... and Patterson and McMillan, although McMillan wasn't out at the time Mr. Summerlin's case became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.811" offset="11903164">That was 2 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.290" offset="11909120">But that series of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.692" offset="11914762">When we say it's... it's old, it's as if Walton was a... in essence, a new rule and Ring was a new rule that corrected Walton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.550" offset="11954155">And so we're back for Mr. Summerlin where he's raised this issue for 20 years since 1983, over 20 years, and... and has sought to have the jury verdict on the capital offense to make... and their determination of whether he was eligible for the death penalty.</text>
