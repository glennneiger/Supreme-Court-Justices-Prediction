            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="10.176" offset="40647">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United Sates Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.073" offset="64261">The Employee Retirement Security Act known as ERISA was intended to protect employees’ justified expectations of receiving the benefits their employers promise them.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.621" offset="110446">To that end, ERISA’s anti-cutback rule prohibits any amendment of an employee pension plan that would reduce a plan participant’s accrued pension benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.825" offset="155272">Respondents Heinz and Schmitt are retired construction workers covered by a multi employer pension plan that is administered by the petitioner, Central Laborers' Pension Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.940" offset="203755">When Heinz and Schmitt retired, the terms of their pension plan allowed them to receive pension benefits and still take post-employment work as construction supervisors, as they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.083" offset="252238">In 1998 however, the plan was amended to prohibit supervisory work and Heinz and Schmitt’s pension benefits were suspended when they refused to quit their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.298" offset="301140">The question is whether ERISA’s anti-cutback rule prohibits applying the 1998 plan amendments to Heinz and Schmitt.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.417" offset="333636">We must decide, in other words, whether the plan reduced already accrued benefits when it expanded the categories of post-retirement employment that triggers suspension of those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.941" offset="383687">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we hold that the amendment did reduce accrued benefits and accordingly we affirm the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.127" offset="420467">As a matter of commonsense, a participant’s benefits cannot be understood without reference to the conditions imposed on receiving those benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.326" offset="453277">An amendment placing materially greater restrictions on the receipt of the benefits therefore reduces the benefit just as surely as a decrease in the size of the monthly pension benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.503" offset="501969">Heinz and Schmitt worked in accrued pension benefits under a plan with terms allowing them to supplement retirement income by working as construction supervisors and they were being reasonable if they relied on those terms in planning their retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.742" offset="562887">The 1998 amendment undercut any such reliance paying retirement income only if the respondents accepted a substantial curtailment of their opportunity to do the kind of work they knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.144" offset="624536">We simply do not see how, in any practical sense, this change of terms could not be viewed as shrinking the value of the respondents’ pension rights and reducing the benefits that they had already earned.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.970" offset="671869">Our reading is confirmed by an internal revenue service regulation that it adopts justice reading of ERISA’s anti-cutback rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.772" offset="703007">The regulation allows employers to modify the pension packages they are offering to their employees so long as any changes applies solely to the portion of an employee’s retirement benefits earned his compensation for future employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.409" offset="769567">The IRS regulations treats such a plan modification very differently however when an employer attempts to add new conditions to the receipt of benefits already accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.669" offset="814602">The rule in that case is categorical, “the addition of objective conditions with respect to a pension benefit that is already accrued violates the anti-cutback rule.”</text>
            <text syncTime="215.235" offset="860891">So far as the IRS regulations are concerned, the any anti-cutback provision flatly prohibits plans from attaching new conditions to benefits that an employee has already earned.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.837" offset="903314">The fact that the Internal Revenue Service has taken different positions and less formal settings is not relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.512" offset="929959">Speaking in its authoritative voice, the IRS has long since approved the interpretation of the ani-cutback rule that we adopt today.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.923" offset="963605">Justice Breyer has filed a concurring opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justices O’Connor and Ginsburg joined.</text>
