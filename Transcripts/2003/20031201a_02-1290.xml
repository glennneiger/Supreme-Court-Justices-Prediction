            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">We'll hear argument now in No. 02-1290, the United States Postal Service v. Flamingo Industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.256" offset="33019">Mr. Kneedler.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="9.910" offset="39602">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.375" offset="53499">The Ninth Circuit held in this case that the United States Postal Service may be sued for treble damages under the Federal antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.548" offset="86100">The court of appeals fundamentally erred in this holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.892" offset="99474">Throughout the nation's history, postal operations have been carried out by the United States Government itself, pursuant to the express authorization in article I of the Constitution, for Congress to establish post offices and post roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.124" offset="160496">As this Court explained in the Council of Greenburgh case about 20 years ago, the furnishing of postal services has historically been regarded as a sovereign function, indeed a sovereign necessity, to promote intercourse among the states and bind the nation together.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.811" offset="223190">Such functions of the United States Government are not regulated by the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.634" offset="246491">Indeed, more than 60 years ago, in the Cooper Corporation case, this Court held that the United States is not a person for purposes of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.126" offset="284421">Although the precise question before the Court in that case was whether the United States could sue as a plaintiff under section 7 of the Sherman Act, the Court noted that the same word, person, is used to describe who may be held liable as a defendant, either in a civil action or in a criminal prosecution.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="88.753" stopTime="98.662">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="88.753" offset="354952">Mr. Kneedler, in your view, are there any instrumentalities of the United States that you think could be considered a person under the Sherman Act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="98.662" stopTime="121.075">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="98.662" offset="394553">Well, I...  I think that there are no instrumentalities that are constituent parts of the United States Government itself that could...  that could be held liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.783" offset="431125">The word instrumentality is used in a...  in a somewhat vague sense, elastic sense, and I think it would be necessary to look at the particular statute to see how much of a governmental character a particular entity has.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="121.075" stopTime="133.147">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="121.075" offset="484206">Of course, I guess the court whose judgment we're reviewing thought that the change in the structure of the Postal Service affected the nature of that instrumentality.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="133.147" stopTime="160.501">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="133.147" offset="532584">It...  it...  it did, but the...  the court of appeals was wrong on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.877" offset="551497">First of all, after the...  the court of...  after the...  this Court's Cooper decision, a number of lower court decisions have held, beginning with the D.C. Circuit's decision in the Sea-Land case involving the Alaska Railroad, that agencies of the United States or instrumentalities just like the United States itself is not a person subject to the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.425" offset="637597">The Ninth Circuit didn't...</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="160.501" stopTime="173.876">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="160.501" offset="641985">Mr. Kneedler...  Mr. Kneedler, but I don't think in that case there was...  the question was raised whether the Alaska Railroad was an agent of the United States that would...  would carry the immunity of the United States.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="173.876" stopTime="205.659">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="173.876" offset="695484">Well, the...  the...  it was...  the Court regarded it as an...  as an instrumentality, and in fact the...  the Court there recognized that the railroad and the officials of the Government responsible for supervising the railroad could be sued under the APA, and that, therefore, there had been a waiver of sovereign immunity to that extent, and to the extent of allowing injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.288" offset="785136">So the...  the Court certainly focused on the question that the Alaska Railroad and those responsible for managing it were part of the United States Government.</text>

          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="205.659" stopTime="209.580">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="205.659" offset="822544">I didn't think it was a contested issue in...  in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="209.580" offset="838217">It may not have been contested, but it...  but it...  the Court certainly addressed that question and then went on to hold that as an instrumentality of the United States, the...  the railroad was not subject to suit under the antitrust law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="223.326" stopTime="226.010">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="223.326" offset="893283">Is the Postal Service subject to the Administrative Procedure Act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="226.010" stopTime="279.963">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="226.010" offset="903941">It is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.836" offset="907285">It...  it...  Congress specifically accepted it that there's...  in section 410 of the act, there's a very detailed enumeration of the provisions that Congress did want and did not want to be...  the Postal Service to be subject to.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.607" offset="970397">But the...  the important point for present purposes is that in 1970, when Congress enacted the Postal Reorganization Act, it carried forward the essential governmental character of the Postal Service, just as it had been up until that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.755" offset="1031001">In fact, section 101(a) of the act says that the United States...  and I quote...  the United States Postal Service shall be operated as a basic and fundamental service provided to the people by the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.502" offset="1085962">And then it says, the Postal Service shall have as its basic function the obligation to provide postal services to bind the nation together.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="279.963" offset="1119817">So you say it carried forward the...  the essential governmental character.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.338" offset="1137267">What...  what does that consist of?</text>
            <text syncTime="286.667" offset="1146567">Doesn't it consist of the nature of the entity, not just...  just the...  the tag?</text>
            <text syncTime="292.429" offset="1169659">It can't just put a tag on it and...  and say it has an essentially governmental character.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.796" offset="1191184">I thought that the...  that the purpose of the reorganization was to make the Postal Service function like a regular business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1498.161" offset="5992594">First, this is unlike any other Federal entity in the fact that the Postal Service has been authorized to decide which markets it wants to compete into.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.078" offset="6028225">It's not competing in order to fulfill a specific congressional mission, but rather to compete in order to break even to make money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.887" offset="6055497">Second, Congress has directed the Postal Service enter these markets with scant regulatory oversight.</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.186" offset="12248712">So again, the Postal Office has defined itself through its actions as a person in comparable commercial tort situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.633" offset="12278491">It's only logical that if a Postal Service in the commercial world, saying that it's not like the United States for copyrights, for trademarks, then it's not like United States with respect to antitrust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.877" offset="12327497">When Congress formed the Postal Service, Your Honors, and it took away the APA, the Postal Rate Commission for these non-monopoly actions, as well as the Federal acquisition regulations, certainly there was a quid pro quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.379" offset="12369502">If you streamline the operations of the Postal Service, launch it into business, you would expect the private commercial torts in antitrust laws to be the restraint to make sure that the monopoly is not extended to the other kind of operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.278" offset="12429061">And so I think that Congress' intent is quite clear that the Postal Service is unique, does not partake of the United States, and therefore, just as the Postal Service can be sued in tort law and under the Lanham Act, be it the old Lanham Act, the new Lanham Act, it can be sued under the antitrust laws as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.518" offset="12498024">The burden, therefore, on the Solicitor General to explain why Congress would have wanted the Postal Service's monopoly to be extended, and why Congress would have wanted the Postal Service to be sue...  to be able to be sued and to sue themselves without really being able to take advantage of the opportunity to sue in their own name under the antitrust laws or under trademark and copyright law, et cetera, and why they shouldn't be sued as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.656" offset="12606589">If there are no further questions, thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.667" offset="12630622">Several points, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.875" offset="12647445">In addition to the other statutes that I've mentioned with respect to the right to sue, there are a number of other respects in which Congress has treated the Postal Service as a Federal entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.475" offset="12693838">It's subject to their Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, the Inspector General Act, it's subject to the Federal sector OSHA regulations, and as this Court pointed out in the Loeffler decision, it's subject to the Federal sector Title VII prohibitions, not...  it's not treated as a private corporation for purposes of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.225" offset="12764891">It is subject to the National Labor Relations Act, but this act was passed in 1970 before the Federal sector labor...  labor management provisions came in in the Civil Service Reform Act, and as you pointed out, Justice Scalia, that's an express provision subjecting the Postal Service to something that otherwise applies to private entities, but in...  but in virtually every other respect, Congress has specified that it would be subject to Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.450" offset="12865724">And in section 409 of the act, with respect to judicial proceedings, Congress specified that the Postal Service would be...  would be treated just like the United States, not just with respect to Tort Claims Act, but venue, removal jurisdiction, and representation by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.179" offset="12944614">But the...  the most fundamental point, however, to be made is that this is not a situation in which Congress has created a new entity and launched, in that sense, that entity into a private commercial world.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.783" offset="13007099">Here, Congress has carried forward the nation's tradition of treating postal services as sovereign functions performed by the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.897" offset="13047536">These are...  these are...  to the extent they're commercial functions and...  and they are unusual commercial functions, the Constitution treats them as...  as something of particular interest to the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.074" offset="13096229">I should point out that with respect to the postal services, all postal services are subject to the jurisdiction of the Postal Rate Commission, not just those that are subject to monopoly, that...  that the Postal Service has monopoly control over, Justice Breyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.587" offset="13162266">So even in those areas in which the Postal Service is subject to competition in...  in parcel and express mail, for example, the Postal Service...  the Postal Rate Commission...  does have regulatory jurisdiction over those...</text>

            <text syncTime="3304.705" offset="13218795">It does not over greeting cards, but the non-postal functions of the Postal Service constitute less than 1 percent of the revenues of the...  of the Postal Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.318" offset="13249202">We're talking about a very minor aspect of the Postal Service's operations, and the affirmative authorization for the Postal Service to engage in that in section 404(7) of the act is cast in the same terms as the Postal Service's authorization to engage in all the other functions and they're really incidental.</text>

            <text syncTime="3329.574" offset="13318269">But the fact that it's only...  the fact that it's only 1 percent means they're only liable under the antitrust laws for 1 percent of their business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3365.324" offset="13461211">That's the curious thing about this suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3375.642" offset="13502485">And in procurement, and in procurement in particular, Congress has treated the Postal Service like all other...  all other Federal agencies under the Contract Disputes Act, particularly with respect to the disputes at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.214" offset="13560790">So in the end we believe that, as Justice O'Connor said, this is essentially a policy choice for Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.787" offset="13583047">If...  if in the current climate the Postal Service is to be subject to the antitrust laws, notwithstanding the fact that it remains a governmental entity, that is a...  that is a choice that Congress should make, whether these governmental activities should be regulated by treble damage actions, which was extremely unusual under...  under Federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.446" offset="13657757">And where Congress has chosen to subject the United States to liability under statutes such as this, but not nearly as free-ranging in the patent laws, et cetera, it has done so expressly, and we think 30 years after the passage of the Postal Reorganization Act, that if the...  if the Postal Service is now to be subject to the antitrust laws, that is something for Congress to do and not for the courts to try to divine from complete silence in the Postal Reorganization Act or its legislative history on that point.</text>
