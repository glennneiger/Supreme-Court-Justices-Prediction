            <text syncTime="158.766" offset="634984">But to finish the answer to Justice Scalia, the... the issue that underlies the whole concept of foreign sovereign immunity at its very basis is the question of whether our courts, in the case of United States' jurisdiction, will exercise jurisdiction to question past judgment on the sovereign conduct of foreign states acting in their own... within their own borders with respect to property within their own country in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.397" offset="6649522">We believe there are four independent grounds for affirming the lower court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.855" offset="6667389">First, as the Court has just discussed, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act regulates the exercise of jurisdiction, not the underlying primary conduct of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.650" offset="6702498">Therefore, the Act does not operate retrospectively.</text>

            <text syncTime="1679.198" offset="6716709">Well, why doesn't it retro... why... why isn't it just as easy to say that it does operate retrospectively, because the question is, when should it exercise jurisdiction for a particular purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.139" offset="6760490">And on the one hand there's no point in exercising jurisdiction now if it's not going to adjudicate later, so so far as the court is concerned, presumably it's going to adjudicate on a substantive issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.854" offset="6811376">That being the purpose, why can you... why really does it make sense to draw that neat line?</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.189" offset="6852754">Why... why... why isolate jurisdiction when we all know that the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction is to exercise it for the purpose of adjudicating a particular kind of case and to apply a particular substantive law to it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.777" offset="6915030">Because the... the operative event, the event that's being regulated by a jurisdictional statute, as the Court has said, is that exercise of the Court's power, regardless of when the underlying acts took place, the Court has differentiated between the primary conduct of the parties and the secondary conduct, which is the exercise of the Court's power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.301" offset="6993189">For example, just last term in the Dole Food case, the Court found that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is not intended to chill the conduct of the foreign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.415" offset="7033626">Rather, it's there to decide whether now presently it would embarrass the conduct of foreign relations, and the... 25 years ago, over 25 years ago, Congress decided that cases such as these should be allowed to go forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.161" offset="7160581">Why not... why not get into it now and consider it in interpreting the... the scope of the act, in particular its retroactivity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1874.084" offset="7496307">In... the same district court judge who handled our case and granted jurisdiction in our case, Judge Cooper, also was given a class action case asserting World War II era claims against Austria, this is the Anderman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.209" offset="7548761">And just last April, she threw out that entire class action, because the Government had come in and filed a statement of interest and asserted its interest in the... in the case, and she found very similar to the Court's holding in Garamendi last term that the political question doctrine was implicated when the Government comes in and says that the prosecution of this particular case will interfere with foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.955" offset="7639771">But I've never heard any... in any other case the Government say that a case that does not implicate foreign relations, as this one does, should be dismissed on jurisdiction grounds merely because we have justiciability concerns with other cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2162.918" offset="8651651">The act of state doctrine, as I understand it, is designed to prevent courts from entering into situations where there is no settled basis for deciding the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.723" offset="8698880">In other words, in the Cuban cases where there's a regime that has a completely different property system than ours, it would be unwise for the courts to venture into this political dispute over whether communism or capitalism is the appropriate way to adjudicate these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.380" offset="8757499">In our case, we have a treaty, article 26 of the Austrian State Treaty says Austria must return property taken from Jewish families during the Nazi era.</text>

            <text syncTime="2804.302" offset="11217189">So, in other words, very clearly before the suit could not proceed, now the statute's been changed without any suggestion of retroactivity in the enactment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2998.690" offset="11994697">Our third point, this I don't want to spend too much time on, but it's our view that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act merely codified the common law of sovereign immunity, and therefore, it did not substantially change the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.345" offset="12053316">If one looks at the State Department circular that was sent out in 1976 to foreign states, it says, this enactment will not substantially alter the rules for deciding sovereign immunity questions in U.S. courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.306" offset="12113189">So it was the position of the State Department at the time that they proposed this legislation that it merely codified what the State Department then considered to be the rules of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.186" offset="12156656">And we have an interesting situation, I think an unprecedented situation, because the common law itself depended on the views of the State Department, so we have a little bit of a reflexive situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.514" offset="12202005">The way I look at it, let us suppose, for example, that the... that instead of enacting the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act they issued another Tate letter, another letter that merely said, henceforth we want the courts to adjudicate under this... under this regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.143" offset="12272536">So it's not a new statute, it's just a suggestion to the courts on how to decide cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="3173.713" offset="12694779">I think it's easier to decide the case on those, rather than the way the Ninth Circuit did in evaluating the expectations, but if one doesn't decide in our favor on all of those other arguments, that the statute itself is jurisdictional, that Congress intended it to apply, that there's really no change in the law because it's the same as the common law of sovereign immunity, then really under Hughes one has to look at whether, as to the parties of this case, there is any retroactive effect, and that... that's... that's what the Hughes holding is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.858" offset="12811389">It's a statute phrased jurisdictionally, but let's look at what happened here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3235.924" offset="12943673">And in this case, as we've made very clear, Austria could always have been sued, at least since it was re-established after World War II for these acts, and as a matter of fact, Austria was required by the United States to enact restitution laws that were designed to afford people like Mrs. Altmann relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3321.211" offset="13284833">--Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.417" offset="13285564">I... I don't know how all states have done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.729" offset="13294864">I know that, for example, in Austria we cited the Dralle case, which concerned a post-war communist expropriation of a... of a subsidiary company in Czechoslovakia, and a German company was allowed to sue Czechoslovakia in Austria concerning the trademarks and... and the expropriation, and have an Austrian court rule whether that expropriation violated international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.052" offset="13388173">So I would say as to Austria, the argument is, and I think we cited also in our brief a statement by an Austrian professor, Seidl-Hohenveldern, who said that the courts... there's nothing in international law that prevents courts from adjudicating the rights and property taken in violation of international law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Scott P. Cooper</label>
            <text syncTime="3373.512" offset="13494021">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.620" offset="13502380">Just on that last point, the Dralle case, which is one that we address in our reply brief, does not stand for the proposition that Czechoslovakia's expropriation could be second-guessed in Austria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.230" offset="13560895">Quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.139" offset="13564552">Austria determined that the legality of Czechoslovakia's activities in their own... in its own country were not subject to reconsideration in Austria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.633" offset="13602482">Austria concerned itself only with whether, given its own neutrality as between Czechoslovakia and Germany, whether Austria could give effect to an expropriation as an act of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.802" offset="13655144">And it determined that it could not with respect to property located in Austria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.799" offset="13675102">That issue has nothing to do with what's before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.604" offset="13686387">Sovereign immunity isn't merely a form selection rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.268" offset="13704986">It confers on the foreign state the right to choose whether and where to be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.121" offset="13732467">That's a substantive right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.691" offset="13738736">It's a right this country has always understood as a right in a sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.315" offset="13757231">Austria's choice, if it did so choose, the circumstances under which it would provide remedies in its own country, either by statute or in its own courts, doesn't constitute a waiver of the sovereignty to which it had been accorded in this country throughout the current period up to 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.464" offset="13853780">So this country has always recognized the difference between a sovereign's right to create a remedy, and this country has done so in its own instances with respect to events that were claimed to be the subject of reparations, and by doing so it has never suggested that it thought it was subjecting itself to the jurisdiction of a foreign court for individual claims to be able to look for more than the statute of the United States provided for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.155" offset="13968614">In addition, with respect to the law immediately prior to the enactment of the FSIA, I think the suggestion was that somehow the United States had... had eroded the expropriation rule or that Congress thought that it was adopting the... codifying the law of the land with respect to expropriation in the FSIA, and that plainly is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.334" offset="14069238">The legislative history, and more importantly the statements of the State Department, in particular the... the digest by John Boyd with respect to State Department decisions from 1952 to 1976 cited in our brief make it clear that the State Department considered this to be a fundamental change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.753" offset="14146978">The conduct being regulated here is expropriation or at the very least possession that goes back to events in 1948 alleged in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.369" offset="14197447">It is not the mere question of the exercise of jurisdiction here or, worse yet, this mere substitution of another tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.573" offset="14234227">This is something that Congress focused on in each of the expropriation exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.003" offset="14264007">It identified the conduct that it thought the foreign sovereign had engaged in that justified one of our narrow exceptions to the general concept of foreign sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.611" offset="14306429">Whether that was an express waiver under (a)(1), whether that was the exercise of commercial conduct that any private party could engage in under (a)(2) or the... or the expropriation of property in violation of international law in (a)(3), Congress identified the conduct that it thought justified the lifting of the generally applicable foreign sovereign immunity and decided that's the conduct we want to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.926" offset="14403605">And that's what we think justifies the variance from our general rule with respect to sovereigns, and that is a change in the law that requires application of the retroactivity analysis to treat those sovereigns fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.506" offset="14457940">If there are no further questions, I have nothing.</text>
