            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="9.454" offset="37721">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.593" offset="50364">This is an ERISA pension case.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.572" offset="58201">The petitioner is a multiemployer pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.461" offset="69799">The respondent plaintiffs are two plan participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.971" offset="83801">Each accrued a pension and took early retirement at age 39, and each claimed a full pension in the form of a life annuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.790" offset="115148">At issue in the case is a plan amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.086" offset="124343">It authorizes the suspension of retirees' benefit payments during the time that they choose to go back to work as construction supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.124" offset="160496">Before the amendment, suspension was triggered only by work as a construction laborer.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.491" offset="181917">The change gives rise to an important, albeit highly technical, question about the relationship between two provisions of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.582" offset="214309">The question is: may such an amended employment suspension provision apply to previously accrued benefits?</text>
            <text syncTime="60.808" offset="243148">The plan says the answer is yes; the participants say the answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.387" offset="261538">The expert agencies charged by Congress with administering ERISA have also spoken to the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.960" offset="283794">They say that ERISA does authorize such an amendment, and they reached that conclusion by construing the two ERISA provisions in para materia.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.557" offset="314201">Countless pension plans around the Nation, in turn, have relied on the agencies' guidance in shaping their plan amendments for decades, and that is the principal reason that the case is so important.</text>

            <text syncTime="102.911" offset="411585">--There... there are a couple of layers of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.406" offset="421616">The first is that the IRS publishes guidance ahead of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.362" offset="433424">For about 2 decades, there has been something called the LRM, the List of Required Modifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.101" offset="456307">It's quoted in... it's quoted in the Government's brief in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.733" offset="470831">And that said to plans, if you're going to adopt a plan or revise a plan, here's what you can do.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="123.306" offset="493192">Then there's a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.080" offset="500297">The second step is that more recently they have published what's known as to IRM, the Internal Revenue Manual, and that's guidance for IRS employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.701" offset="538749">And then there's a third level, and that is plans can submit their plan provisions and amendments to the IRS for what are known as determination letters on which the IRS signs off.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.937" offset="579709">And so all three of those exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.881" offset="603429">I don't think that the IRS was able to come up with a particular number, but they did say that their consistent practice for decades has been to approve this particular--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="159.798" offset="639164">Is there anything to document that, that it's been for decades?</text>
            <text syncTime="162.770" offset="651076">I mean, the manual provisions and the rest of... of what you're describing is not... not published.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.656" offset="682527">So where do we get the 2 decades from?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas C. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="174.250" offset="696947">--We get that from, I guess, two sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.850" offset="707396">The first is that there is the document... the... the series of documents known as the LRM, the List of Required Modifications, that has guided the plans for a couple of decades, and it does not restrain plans in its... it specifically addresses revisions to plans, amendments, and it doesn't say that you can only apply it a suspension provision to benefit payments that accrue in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.777" offset="791092">Beyond that, when it comes to, you know, what the IRS does day in and day out, we just have their representation.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="217.467" offset="869773">--It... it... literally in its text it does, but as a practical matter it doesn't because, as I was saying to Justice Ginsburg, the LRM's have addressed revisions to plans and to amendments, and they haven't restrained in any way the ability to apply it to previous--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="232.783" stopTime="234.807">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="232.783" offset="931109">But that's a pretty negative inference, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="234.807" offset="939154">--It's true, but the... the way these documents work, as I understand them, is that if there's a restriction, something you can't do, they say it expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.897" offset="971546">When you... remember, the default rule under ERISA, of course, is that you are allowed to adopt a plan amendment, and then the... they... they articulate particular restrictions--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="252.102" offset="1008327">So I... I think it's pretty explicit when it says that the accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.671" offset="1050645">And I don't... the trouble I'm having is it just seems to me utterly unrealistic to say that his accrued benefit has not been decreased when he used to be able to work as a... as a supervisor and continued to draw from the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.511" offset="1118041">Now he cannot work as a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.855" offset="1131416">How can you... I mean, certainly if you placed a dollar value on his right to receive money from the plan, you would... you would put a higher price on... on the... the individual who has the right to work as a supervisor and still continue to draw money as opposed to the person who doesn't have that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.167" offset="1212604">I mean, the... the language just seems to me utterly plain.</text>

            <text syncTime="315.799" offset="1263177">But just to lay them out, it's going to be the text, the purposes of the suspension provision, which is section 203(a)(3)(B), and what will best protect participants' expectations.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.746" offset="1302883">You focus rightly on the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.111" offset="1308421">The... the key is what is a benefit versus what is a suspension of benefit payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.359" offset="1333394">As I said in the introduction, the plan participants here earned a benefit and that is a life annuity in a service only pension.</text>

            <text syncTime="878.057" offset="3512216">But when you come to the question of the suspension of benefit payments, which throughout ERISA is a different concept than a decrease in benefits, when you come to a suspension... that is, your... your claim to the benefit payment each month... I'm taking that away from you... that's covered by 1053.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.185" offset="3580656">And our point is that this plan amendment is... and the Government agrees... is authorized by 1053.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.751" offset="3606988">I had said that I was also going to go beyond the... move from the text to the purposes underlying the statute and the protection of participants' legitimate expectations.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.244" offset="3644918">But before doing that, I do want to point to the regulation, Justice Scalia, that addresses our understanding of what it is to decrease, and we contend that the regulation, which is published after notice and comment, is entitled to Chevron deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.271" offset="3704999">And it is... is reproduced on page 8a of the yellow brief, and I will just... it's quoted in our brief as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.080" offset="3732271">And it explains that a decrease in a benefit is something that changes the computation of the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.768" offset="3759020">This does not change the computation of the benefit.</text>

            <text syncTime="947.076" offset="3788278">Briefly, with respect to the purpose of the statute and plan's expectations, the critical point is that the suspension rule cannot work if it... this is section 203(a)(3)(B), the 1053 provision... cannot work if it does not apply to already accrued benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1041.625" offset="4166426">And those showed that Congress was cabining the authority of plans so that they didn't unduly restrict the ability of plan participants to go back to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="3530.097" offset="14120333">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.381" offset="14141440">I have four points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.413" offset="14145620">The first deals what kind of promises we can make to participants that they can enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.614" offset="14166413">The promise can only go in one direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.193" offset="14176758">That is, if we promise them we will not change the suspension rules, if they... trustees put that provision in and the employees and the participants rely on it, we... that... to... to change that would violate the plan and they would have a right under 502 to enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.037" offset="14236108">But, Justice Scalia, there is no way that there's a middle ground under which the plans flag for the participants, hey, this is open to a change because 204(g)... if they win, they'll win under 204(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.776" offset="14283024">204(g) is categorical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.616" offset="14290442">You can't reduce benefits even if you say you're going to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.787" offset="14307056">It's just no way you can do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.849" offset="14315311">And therefore, the only middle ground is under our provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.193" offset="14328686">If participants and the trustees want a plan provision, making it a concrete promise, we won't change the rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="3609.729" offset="14438818">But it's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.389" offset="14441535">It could have gone... we could have been even more clear, but this is a right, a statutory right, that we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.249" offset="14464940">Justice O'Connor, Justice Ginsburg, what does 203 cover?</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.222" offset="14476852">It covers a normal retirement benefit, and usually what we think of as an early retirement benefit, that is, the unsubsidized portion of an... of a early retirement benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.096" offset="14520320">The third is it is... Justice Breyer is absolutely right about the purpose of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.742" offset="14538919">We want to be able to adjust to current labor conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.086" offset="14552294">And Justice Souter, the statute recognizes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.141" offset="14564519">203(a) has a special rule for multiemployer plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.197" offset="14576744">They cover things like construction and labor where the markets change a lot, and they have a much narrower provision in 203 for single employer plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.318" offset="14613211">But ultimately, I think that this is fairly characterized as ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.572" offset="14630243">The agency here has an enormous amount of experience in balancing the purposes of these different statutes and knowing what's different between a decrease and a suspension.</text>
