            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>

            <text syncTime="82.732" offset="330919">But it was also true in Penry II, which when it came to this Court, came from the Fifth Circuit on a denial of COA, and this Court resolved the merits in that case by examining the merits of the underlying State court decision and reversed the judgment in the case in exactly the same fashion that we are asking the Court to do in our case.</text>

            <text syncTime="101.514" offset="406047">Well, as long as we're into these preliminary matters... and then I'll let you, so far as I'm concerned, proceed the way you wish.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.420" offset="429662">It is true that in this case, isn't it, if... if we say there should be a COA, the Fifth Circuit is just going to follow its... its earlier panel opinion, and I... I assume it must on... on the nexus rule.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_c_owen" startTime="119.968" stopTime="200.382">
            <label>Mr. Robert C. Owen</label>
            <text syncTime="119.968" offset="479817">That's exactly right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.030" offset="488072">I think that the... in fact, in... within the last couple of years, the Fifth Circuit has taken those rules en banc and has issued an en banc opinion that applies and upholds not just the nexus rule, but the other elaborate sort of framework of the Penry doctrine that we've explained in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.516" offset="566021">So I think you're exactly right, that if the Court grants a COA and returns this case to the Fifth Circuit, it will be back here in 6 months because all the Fifth Circuit panel could do is say it's controlled by the circuit precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.269" offset="617012">So I think in... for that reason as well, Your Honor, if the Court concludes that those rules are, in fact, not consistent with its cases, that the shortest route to resolving the case is to do so at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.787" offset="663092">This Court in Penry I held that the deliberateness question was not an adequate vehicle for giving mitigating effect to a defendant's personal moral culpability, and in this case it functioned exactly the same way as it did in Penry.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.730" offset="722860">Also, the future dangerousness question, with respect to an IQ of 67, could only give that evidence aggravating effect rather than mitigating effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.525" offset="758073">And in the entire context of this trial, particularly with respect to the arguments of counsel respecting the evidence and how it might be treated by the jury, really makes clear the existence of the Penry violation.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>

            <text syncTime="203.521" offset="814080">You are claiming low IQ.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.351" offset="833306">You did not in... in your papers up till now... you did not make a claim of retardation, just low IQ.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.639" offset="870504">Is that still the... there is no... in other words, is no Atkins claim in this case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert C. Owen</label>
            <text syncTime="223.705" offset="894746">There is no Atkins claim before this Court, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.305" offset="905195">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.298" offset="909166">We have filed a successive application in State Court in order to preserve Mr. Tennard's rights to have a determination of whether he's a person with mental retardation.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.245" offset="948976">But the evidence at trial established only his very low IQ, not the other aspects that would have been necessary for a diagnosis of mental retardation.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.443" offset="989727">So there's no Atkins claim before this Court in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.537" offset="1002057">As I was saying, the arguments of counsel sort of highlight the inadequacy of the jury instructions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.391" offset="1029538">Defense counsel's argument was effectively a plea for nullification.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.560" offset="1046152">He asked the jury to take account of the defendant's very low IQ in... in imposing sentence, but he couldn't provide them any sort of road map to tell them how they could get from the low IQ to a no answer to one of the special issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.967" offset="1103830">For his part, the prosecutor, in replying to that argument, said the low IQ is not even relevant to the second special issue, and those were his words: not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.627" offset="1142491">So to some extent the State is trying to have it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.835" offset="1159314">At trial, the prosecution argued to the jury that this fact, a 67 IQ, wasn't relevant to the second special issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.887" offset="1191497">Here, however, tracking the opinion of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, it's respondent's position that this evidence was sufficiently relevant to the second special issue that the jury could be understood to have given it effect in imposing sentence.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="310.723" offset="1242802">But do I understand that the... that the specific issue that we've got here, assuming we... we do reach the... the merits issue as part of the COA problem, is the specific circuit rule that there has got to be a finding of, as I recall, unique severity and a finding of causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.445" offset="1325767">And as I understand what the circuit said was, because those conditions were not satisfied, we ultimately do not even reach the kind of Penry issue that... that you described as being in the background.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.531" offset="1378116">Is... is that a fair statement of what we've got in front of us?</text>

            <text syncTime="348.785" offset="1395043">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.240" offset="1396924">That... that is a fair statement, and I think that that is exactly what the Fifth Circuit did with this case, was it applied these preliminary doctrines which are effectively threshold tests and they looked at this evidence and said, it's not uniquely severe and there's been no showing that it caused the defendant to commit the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.982" offset="1471843">And as a result, the Fifth Circuit never got to the question of how does this evidence possibly fit into the special issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.534" offset="1502041">Because this is a habeas case and we want... we're trying to get the Court to... to ultimately grant relief, we wanted to explain why the underlying State court decision constitutes an unreasonable application of this Court's cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.788" offset="1555122">And the Court of Criminal Appeals relied, on the one hand, on the unique severity idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.443" offset="1577691">They said this IQ score, standing alone, doesn't rise to the level of mental retardation, so Penry is out of the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.624" offset="1606426">And then it went on to say even if that's... even if it was wrong about that judgment, there is some way for the... for the jury to have given it effect in answering the second special issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1127.328" offset="4509257">In the... in the interim, this Court said in Johnson that the test was not necessarily full consideration but meaningful consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.450" offset="4545724">And so our position is that at the time the Court of Criminal Appeals decided this case and said that there was no need for an additional instruction, they... at a minimum, the test was Johnson's demand that there be meaningful consideration and that under this set of instructions, there was no way to give meaningful consideration to the fact of a 67 IQ, and that that is the... that is the way in which the Court of Criminal Appeals went astray.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.728" offset="4650841">And in fact, that's illustrated well, I think, by the portions of the Court of Criminal Appeals opinion that try to show how a jury, confronted with the future dangerousness question, could figure out a chain of a reasoning that would get you from this guy has a 67 IQ to, therefore, we can answer no to the future dangerousness question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.669" offset="4730671">It is based on... it is... the... the chain of inferences that the Court of Criminal Appeals suggests is contrary to the evidence that was presented at trial because it relies on characterizations of Mr. Tennard as a follower which are not in the evidence and aren't supported by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.001" offset="4791902">It is actually contrary to the arguments that were made at trial because the prosecutor told the jury that they wouldn't be allowed to consider what happened or might happen in prison as a way of deciding the answer to the future dangerousness question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.539" offset="4838087">And it's contrary to this Court's cases like Boyd and Penry II where the Court says, in deciding whether a jury was able to give effect to mitigating evidence under the charge, you don't just look at the language of the charge, but you look at the evidence, you look at the arguments, you look at the context of the whole trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.629" offset="4906423">The Court of Criminal Appeals effectively covered up the context of the whole trial and said let's see if we can imagine a trial with different evidence and different arguments that might have produced a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.486" offset="4949891">And that... it may be many things, but that is not a fair reading of Penry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1783.858" offset="7135399">I... I don't know whether the jury was aware of that fact at the time of trial because it was never explained to them, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1791.926" offset="7167687">However, I think the Fifth Circuit's opinion is illustrative of... of the difference between the... the four-part test that's identified in the Fifth Circuit for determining Penry violations and the additional analysis that goes on top of it, which is even aside from this question of whether we have a nexus, whether we have a... whether we have severity or permanence, these other factors, the court invariably ends up looking at whether the jury could consider that evidence within the special issues, whether it was relevant in... in some way, in some meaningful way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.923" offset="7303628">And... and that's the question the Court identified in Johnson and in Graham that... that should be... be the controlling factor in Penry cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.825" offset="7335288">So I think... I think the Eighth Amendment only requires looking at Johnson and Graham, that... that the jury be able to give effect in some manner to the evidence introduced, not that it be able... not that it's required to give effect in every conceivable way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.745" offset="7386906">And so the issue isn't really whether Tennard can identify some relevance for this evidence beyond the special issues that were given, but whether he can... whether we can look at the record and see if it had some relevance within those special issues that was available to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.589" offset="7446256">And I think that's exactly what the State court did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.107" offset="7456392">They looked at deliberateness and as Tennard has argued in his brief, I think quite eloquently, deliberateness was truly designed to deal with the question of party liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.221" offset="7496829">Whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation that death would occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.762" offset="7515011">And in this case, where a party instruction was given during the guilt/innocence phase, there was that lingering question of whether Tennard was the primary actor here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.255" offset="7552940">And so that's exactly how Tennard's counsel argued it to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.849" offset="7567360">He suggested that... that Tennard was a follower.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.071" offset="7580212">He wasn't the primary here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.307" offset="7585228">He may not have even stabbed the victim in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.362" offset="7597349">It might have been his co-defendant who may be lying or... or minimizing their own responsibility in order to cover their tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.664" offset="7618560">And so that's the theory before the jury from counsel's perspective, and that fits squarely within deliberateness here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.633" offset="13258501">Mr. Owen, is your understanding the same as Mr. Marshall's that we're talking about a universe of 100 cases?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_c_owen" startTime="3322.313" stopTime="3475.795">
            <label>Mr. Robert C. Owen</label>
            <text syncTime="3322.313" offset="13289221">I... I tried to count them myself, Your Honor, and my number was closer to 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.636" offset="13310537">And I don't know on what... I don't know where or how we disagree, but I think the universe of cases is... is obviously more than perhaps 40 and... and I guess by his count fewer than 100.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.775" offset="13359020">Again, it's only the people who were sentenced... and again, I think we need to emphasize that a ruling in favor of Mr. Tennard would only affect the sentences of people who introduced mitigating evidence at their trial that had relevance to moral culpability outside the inquiries that the jury received in its instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.937" offset="13439687">So, again, there would be a subset beyond the number of cases just tried prior to 1991 that would include the cases in which certain kinds of mitigating evidence like the 67 IQ in this case were introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.469" offset="13489842">Let me address Justice Breyer's question first about the Fifth Circuit's treatment of the claim in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.753" offset="13510949">Justice Breyer, I'd like to refer you to pages 20 to 22 of our brief, and at those pages we described the way in which the Fifth Circuit analyzed the claim in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.816" offset="13555252">And I think it is... it is the case that they applied both the unique severity test and the nexus test and found us wanting on both scores.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.468" offset="13597780">And then ultimately, in the way that the Fifth Circuit has, having reached the merits, it said that we didn't get a COA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.534" offset="13622126">So I'm... I'm not sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.475" offset="13629858">I think... but that... they did... they did apply the test, and so I don't think there would be anything inappropriate about this Court assessing the appropriateness of the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.012" offset="13667997">With respect to the trial record, I do want to emphasize that the word follower does not appear in defense counsel's closing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.044" offset="13708121">Defense counsel did not make the argument that Mr. Tennard was a follower, that his 67 IQ made him a follower, that he followed other people in committing this crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.588" offset="13742289">There is only one... one comment from defense counsel, a single sentence in the course of the closing argument which says with respect to an earlier crime that Mr. Tennard was involved in, that he was not the leader.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.643" offset="13790563">He doesn't say, and he was less culpable than anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.820" offset="13803207">He doesn't say, he only got involved in that crime because he was following somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.771" offset="13815014">This is not a case that was defended at trial on the theory that Mr. Tennard, because of his 67 IQ, is a follower.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.223" offset="13844793">It is a case that was defended at trial on the theory that having a 67 IQ is the sort of globally disabling quality that affects everything Mr. Tennard does, every action that he takes, every thought that he has, every judgment that he makes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3476.721" offset="13906860">It is certainly argued, Your Honor, that... as defense counsel puts it to the jury, he says, you have a man who has an IQ that is that low, and he says to the jury, none of you know what it's like to have a 67 IQ.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.344" offset="13953358">And I think... and the... and the prosecutor, for his part, doesn't dispute the lowness of the IQ score.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.339" offset="13973316">The prosecutor's argument isn't, oh, come now, a 67 IQ isn't that low.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.632" offset="13990452">The prosecutor's argument is, under these instructions, ladies and gentlemen, you're not asked why Mr. Tennard became a danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.585" offset="14018247">You're being asked whether he's a danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.920" offset="14027651">That's the only thing that the... that the jury was asked to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.885" offset="14043533">I think that... that it's important to keep in mind the quality of this mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.259" offset="14060983">It also was suggested that counsel didn't object to the instructions, didn't ask for a special instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.098" offset="14084389">While he did not ask for a special instruction at the point of the jury charge, there is a pretrial motion filed by defense counsel which complains that the Texas statute does not permit the consideration of mitigating circumstances, which asked for definitions of the key terms in the statute, and that was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.571" offset="14142276">So it's... it's certainly not a case in which there was... it was... you know, the people at trial were unaware of this problem with the instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.258" offset="14169025">That's evident from defense counsel's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.488" offset="14177907">I think that the... the one... one thing I want to emphasize about the nature of this mitigating evidence is the way in which it's... it's... it does affect moral culpability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.399" offset="14221584">And the quote I found that I liked the best on this actually is from a concurring opinion in Skipper where, in the course of explaining why they felt that evidence of good behavior in jail didn't qualify as Eighth Amendment mitigating evidence, Justice Powell joined, among others, by Chief Justice Rehnquist, said, evidence of a reduced capacity for considered choice bears directly on the fundamental justice of imposing capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.209" offset="14332761">This evidence in our case is evidence of that kind of reduced capacity that the jury had no vehicle for giving that kind of mitigating effect to in imposing sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.701" offset="14370795">We'd ask the Court to reverse the judgment below.</text>
