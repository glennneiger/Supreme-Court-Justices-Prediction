            <text syncTime="8.878" offset="35422">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.079" offset="56216">The officers in this case went to respondent's apartment on a weekday afternoon to execute a valid search warrant for drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.932" offset="83696">They knocked loudly and announced their purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.533" offset="94041">They waited at least 15 to 20 seconds without hearing any response and then forcibly entered the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.683" offset="118700">Those actions were reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.821" offset="131239">The Ninth Circuit concluded otherwise based on its adoption of a rigid, four-part categorical approach to knock and announce cases that is fundamentally at odds with this Court's precedents in two critical respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.908" offset="183589">First, it is inconsistent with the flexibility that is an essential feature of this Court's totality of the circumstances test, and second, it turns primarily on the need to damage some property in order to effectuate an entry, a factor that under this Court's reasoning in Ramirez should have no relevance to whether the entry at a particular time was itself lawful.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="70.057" offset="280137">Did the court here say that these were the only... the only four factors?</text>

            <text syncTime="74.719" offset="298841">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.288" offset="305110">What the court here did... and I would refer the Court to... to page, I believe, 6a of the appendix to the petition for certiorari, actually beginning on page 5a.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.062" offset="348160">What the court does is it first creates four basic categories of knock and announce cases, and those categories are defined by two factors, one being the presence of exigent circumstances and the other being the need to damage property.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.551" offset="406152">And then on page 6a, what it does is its says that the essential question of whether the entry was reasonable is approached in the following way.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.690" offset="454740">First, we characterize... and this is the first full paragraph on page 6a.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.072" offset="468219">In addressing that inquiry, we characterize entries as either forced or non-forced, meaning either property is damaged or not damaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.874" offset="499461">The reasonableness must then be determined in light of the totality of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.074" offset="520255">Now, the court does list a number of factors that it thinks are relevant.</text>

          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="133.213" stopTime="139.613">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="133.213" offset="532793">And... and it says that... that those factors are not exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.762" offset="547004">They say they're... they include but are not limited to.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_b_salmons" startTime="139.613" stopTime="206.774">
            <label>Mr. David B. Salmons</label>
            <text syncTime="139.613" offset="558393">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.017" offset="560065">And we take no issue with its list of non-exclusive factors in terms of whether those factors are relevant to the question under the totality of the circumstances test.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.362" offset="593398">The difficulty we have with the Ninth Circuit's approach in this case is that it has engrafted a rigid property destruction rule onto the Fourth Amendment's flexible standard of reasonableness and onto this Court's totality of the circumstances test.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.539" offset="642090">In other words, what the court of appeals does is it requires that where an entry is non-forcible, again meaning no property need be destroyed, then the officers must wait a significant amount of time before entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.997" offset="695902">But where some property damage is required, it would require, quote, an explicit refusal of admittance or the lapse of an even more substantial amount of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.368" offset="733414">And we think that that both is inconsistent with the totality of the circumstances standard because it imposes this rigid rule of property damage, and it's inconsistent with Ramirez which makes clear that the need to damage property, although it's certainly relevant to the ultimate question of whether the manner of the execution of the warrant is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, it's not a relevant inquiry into whether the entry at a particular time is itself lawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.274" offset="957022">The way that it typically works, as I understand it, Your Honor, is that there is a significant fund set up based on forfeiture assets, and that those funds are used to pay for damage to property that may result during the course of... of a search or... or other law enforcement activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.218" offset="1016790">Typically what happens is the law enforcement officers will not leave the premises until it is at least secured, and then they provide forms or other information so that individuals can make claims--</text>

            <text syncTime="408.177" offset="1632653">In other words, if there's no risk that anything is going away, isn't it reasonable for the police to say, okay, give them another minute or something like that?</text>

            <text syncTime="440.787" offset="1763056">In the hypothetical that you gave, none of those other law enforcement concerns are present, and so the question then, we submit, would be whether the officers could reasonably conclude that they had been constructively denied admittance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1285.054" offset="5140167">15 to 20 seconds is a substantial delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.769" offset="5155004">Even if this Court were to conclude this case based only on the question of whether they had been constructively denied admittance, we think these other factors warranted a prompter entry here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.936" offset="5191680">And in fact, the testimony of the officers in this case suggests that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.160" offset="5208607">The officer from the Nevada police that was at the front door stated that he waited a long time in this case because he thought there was some chance that the case may go to Federal court, and he wanted to make sure that there were no knock and announce concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.428" offset="5265659">The FBI agent at the back of the... of the apartment testified that he... he became concerned about the length of the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.914" offset="5307559">He described it as unusually long and stated that he was concerned that the occupant might be attempting to flee from another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.973" offset="5335876">This is simply not a case that's close to the line, and for the Ninth Circuit to hold that the officers in this case were required to wait some additional period of time that's unspecified, in addition to the 15 to 20 seconds, really does pose threats to law enforcement officials engaged in the front-line law enforcement activities in the jurisdictions covered by the Ninth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3338.080" offset="13352229">Well, Your Honor, what I do know is that as this Court indicated in its decision in Wilson where it incorporated the common law tradition into the Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness, that the standard at common law was a flexible one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.569" offset="13410220">It didn't require knock and announce in all cases, and it took into account a variety of law enforcement concerns and, we would submit, including the risk that there might be dangers to the officer's safety or that evidence might be disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.520" offset="13466018">So we think that our rule is perfectly consistent both with the common law tradition and with this Court's decision in Wilson that incorporated it.</text>
