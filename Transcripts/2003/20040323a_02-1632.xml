            <text syncTime="16.597" offset="66351">The sentencing system at issue here contains exactly the same infirmities that the system... that this de-validated two years ago, in Ring versus Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.429" offset="101669">Once a defendant's convicted of a felony, Washington law sets a statutory cap to that a sentencing Judge may not exceed unless there are facts present that are not accounted for in the guilty verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.916" offset="143569">These are called aggravating facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.689" offset="150674">Yet in Washington, just like Arizona, a Judge makes these findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.860" offset="167393">And in Washington, it's even worse than Arizona in that the standard of proof is a preponderance of the evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.595" offset="198322">But it's--</text>

            <text syncTime="53.272" offset="213055">--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the statutory maximum as Apprendi defines that term, as Apprendi and Ring define that term, is the highest sentence that is allowable based on the facts and the guilty verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.327" offset="261224">That... that sentence in this case, is the top end of the standard range, it would be 53 months for Mr. Blakely.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.726" offset="286824">You're correct that Washington law labels an additional cap as what Washington law calls the statutory maximum which is the ultimate exceptional sentence, or the ultimate enhancement that could be put forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.781" offset="335099">But that is simply a second cap.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.875" offset="347429">The question that this Court in Apprendi and Ring asked was what is the maximum sentence to which the defendant can be subjected to, based on the facts in the guilty verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.618" offset="386403">And that is the top of the standard range.</text>

            <text syncTime="109.887" offset="439484">Well, the big difference, the biggest difference between the Federal system and Washington, is the Federal system is a system of court rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.657" offset="466547">Not a system of Legislative mandates.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.515" offset="473966">So when Apprendi and Ring use the term the highest penalty authorized by the legislature, or the statutory maximum that is easily applied to this case, because all of the--</text>

            <text syncTime="134.862" offset="539376">Because the sentencing system that is at issue here, is fully legislated.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.747" offset="570932">Your point is that if the same scheme that Washington has were adopted by courts, it's okay.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.792" offset="631118">But this Court's clearly held Williams and lots of other cases that if a legislature leaves it up to individual judges to decide what kinds of facts they want to consider in meting out sentences that is fully constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.035" offset="680124">And as this Court described the Federal guideline scheme is Mistretta, this Court in pages 395 and 396 of that opinion said what we really have is just an aggregation of that same individualized discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.152" offset="772598">I realize there was some disagreement on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.086" offset="784300">However, Justice O'Connor, to get back to your question, the critical distinction is, if the legislature is content to leave it up to judges, or the judicial branch to decide what factors matter and where lines should be drawn, then Apprendi is not triggered in the same way that it is when a legislature steps in and says... as it has done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.581" offset="874266">We are not prepared to allow a court to go above a certain threshold unless it finds additional facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="240.047" offset="960157">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there are two parts of Apprendi, one is... footnote 16 of Apprendi, this Court talked about the democratic constraints that operate on legislatures vis-a-vis courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.366" offset="1001430">And when a legislature steps in and says we're not prepared to let a sentence go above a certain level unless certain facts are present, that's a very different system, than when a legislature steps in and says we will let courts operate however they like underneath a certain... underneath a certain system.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.344" offset="1117309">Based on the judge's discretion, that's perfectly okay.</text>

I mean, no matter whether it's happening under the... under the immediate authorization of legislation setting up the guidelines or legislation that sets up, or that authorizes a component of judiciary set guidelines, isn't the same thing going on?</text>

            <text syncTime="334.213" offset="1336842">--Well, from the defendant's point of view you might say that it is, but there is a difference in that Apprendi talks... the baseline of Apprendi is deciding what are elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.623" offset="1374459">And elements... the wellspring of elements and the definition of a crime has to flow from a legislative function, a legislature or the person who makes the laws sets out what facts matter, or what facts don't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.247" offset="1428898">So it's absolutely the case of course that Windship and the Sixth Amendment apply to courts just as much as they apply to legislatures, however we need a baseline for where those rights kick in, and I think that the proper baseline, or a proper baseline would be the facts that the legislative body or the lawmaker has set out that matter for punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.647" offset="6186527">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.074" offset="6200216">Whether the statutory maximums in the State of Washington is what the legislature says it is, or the upper end of the standard range, established only for the purposes of enforcing legislative limitations of judicial discretion is at the heart of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.702" offset="6270746">And I would suggest to this Court that the answer to that question lies in the examination in the way that the statute works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.875" offset="6303451">In Washington, the legislature of course like all States, initially defines the elements of a crime, and sets statutory maximums.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.451" offset="6341799">And I think if we look at the elements of the crime, and look at the way they work, you will see that they are substantially different, the kind of sentencing factors that are dealt with in reaching aggravating, or mitigating sentences under the Sentence Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.660" offset="6394567">The criminal elements apply equally in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.253" offset="6408986">They are necessary and sufficient I think, as was put in the General's brief, in each and every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.714" offset="6442841">They are mandatory, and forced to consider each and every one of them, the fact finder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.544" offset="6462171">And there's only one result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.864" offset="6467396">Conviction... conviction or acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.600" offset="6474397">There's no weighing of competing interests, there is no discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.808" offset="6491220">Now, I offer doing this... the Washington legislature then created the Sentencing Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.239" offset="6520895">The Sentencing Reform Act, I would submit to you created a situation in the State of Washington where we have three zones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.655" offset="6546599">There's first a standard range and I would suggest to you that the word standard in the sense that it's used by the Washington legislature, it's used in defense as a basis of measurement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.843" offset="6583275">The standard range is a baseline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.238" offset="6592888">It is a zone in which the sentencing court has absolute discretion, as you will see in the guidelines themselves, and provisions, that a sentence within these guidelines is not reviewable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1700.539" offset="6802077">This limited discretion is limited only in two ways.</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.569" offset="6914194">One of the primary purposes of the Sentencing Reform Act is to... is to ensure that the defendant, the criminal defendant is punished only for the crime of conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1782.439" offset="7129652">Doesn't it also have to have as a component the identification, the finding of facts upon which this discretion can be exercised.</text>

            <text syncTime="1796.269" offset="7185032">The basis for going above was cruelty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3207.438" offset="12829675">And by doing that, by calling upon judicial discretion to consider unspecified factors, the legislature has not erected surrogate elements, which is what the Court found in Apprendi.</text>

            <text syncTime="3241.701" offset="12966766">That is what it boils down to, Justice Souter, because we're starting from a spectrum at which one end lies Williams versus New York, in which the Court fully accepted that it is entirely constitutional for a judge to say, in my courtroom if you commit a kidnaping and you engage in deliberate cruelty which I'm going to find by a preponderance of the evidence, you're going to get the maximum.</text>

            <text syncTime="3262.417" offset="13049626">If that in fact is the position, then I take it, it is open to a legislature in a case like this to say, instead of having a formal maximum range, I forget what it is, but from zero to 10 years, we're going to make it zero to 100 years, and we're going to leave everything else to the discretion of the judiciary, and Apprendi in effect will be a dead letter.</text>

            <text syncTime="3292.865" offset="13171357">I think that follows directly from Williams versus New York, and it's an additional reason why this Court should be very reluctant to apply Apprendi to sentencing guideline systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.955" offset="13203749">Washington would not have to react to a decision applying Apprendi to its guidelines the way Kansas did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.239" offset="13224856">Washington could decide that, all right, if the problem is that our standard range created a top of a statutory maximum term, we're just going to do away with the top of the standard range, and we'll leave it to judicial discretion, with the following policy statements to give some guidance to what they do.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey L. Fisher</label>
            <text syncTime="3506.366" offset="14025456">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.900" offset="13423595">I think it's important to make two points about Washington law, lest the Court be left with any confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.813" offset="13443239">The first is, the Washington legislature has most definitely not left it up to Washington judges to depart upward for any reason they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.268" offset="13481064">They have not left it entirely up to the judges' discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.619" offset="13490469">A judge has to find, as the judge in this case did, one of the eleven listed factors or one that is analogous to those eleven factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.754" offset="13522965">And there are case after case in Washington, or appellate decisions saying this aggravating fact is not good enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.736" offset="13546893">But if the Gore decision, and the Cardenas decision both cited in my briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.618" offset="13562462">Another example is Barnes... the Barnes decision at 818 P. 2d 1088 in which for example the Washington Supreme Court said future dangerous which is a common aggravating factor in other contexts, it's not a valid aggravating factor in Washington in most kinds of crimes because the legislature did not list that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.985" offset="13643860">And in fact what the Washington Supreme Court said there, is they said, if we were to find that we would be giving ourselves too much discretion back for the very point of the Sentencing Reform Act was to take discretion away from us, to go above the standard sentencing range.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.888" offset="13695478">The second point about Washington law is, Mr. Knodell is right, that there is some discretion built into the system, but that discretion kicks in only after the judge has made the required factual finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.572" offset="13742184">In that respect the system is just like the one in Ring where the aggravating fact is necessary but not sufficient for the ultimate sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.887" offset="13767471">The Judge still can in his discretion... this, Justice Breyer, goes to your question, the judge still once the jury or the proper fact finder makes all the required factual findings, the judge can still consider all the facts in the case, and go anywhere below that new maximum that's been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.456" offset="13833822">So judicial discretion is still retained in Kansas' system and it would be retained in Washington's system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.127" offset="13860467">And the final thing I'd like to say is that Mr. Dreeben's point that this case is different than Ring because the fact that they're illustrative rather than exclusive would lead to Apprendi simply being a mere formality because all the legislature would have to do, for example in the Ring case, is have factor number 11 that says anything similar to the others on this list.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.827" offset="13943223">Then you'd have people saying, well, judges can do just about what they were doing, which was finding one of those 10 factors, but because there's factor 11, that says something similar to this is also good enough that Apprendi somehow doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.087" offset="13992333">We submit that a straightforward application of Apprendi as it was stated in Ring, requires a reversal in this case.</text>
