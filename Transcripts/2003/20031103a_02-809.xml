            <label>Mr. Gary E. Bair</label>
            <text syncTime="2889.036" offset="11556049">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.401" offset="11561587">I just wanted to first clarify any record inconsistencies or... or clarifications that might be in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.925" offset="11603696">I believe that the court of appeals' opinion, which is at appendix page 3A to the petition for cert, makes very clear that the court of appeals, the highest court in Maryland, construed the record as the officer seeing a large amount of money rolled up in the glove compartment, and it totaled $763.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.442" offset="11685721">That is clearly stated in the court of appeals' opinion, and I would direct the Court's attention to the trial transcripts at pages 83 to 84.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.421" offset="11729607">It is not in the joint appendix but it is in the record in the case, the trial transcript pages 83 to 84 from the trial on April 10th of 2000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.195" offset="11772761">The police officer who arrested respondent testified at the trial that he saw a large roll of money in the glove compartment and that it totaled $763, so clearly there is record support and the court of appeals so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.678" offset="11834619">With regard to the glove compartment being closed or locked, there's nothing in the record ever indicating that the glove compartment was locked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.344" offset="11869309">I think the only natural inference from this record is that it was closed at the time the car was stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.371" offset="11893447">The officer saw the drug... excuse me... saw the money in the glove compartment when the driver went to retrieve his vehicle registration, and then after the officer obtained consent to search the car, he then opened the glove compartment again and seized the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.514" offset="11958021">I think it's ironic that the rule that is being suggested by respondent is the bright line rule that the driver should always be arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.749" offset="11998981">I think that's absolutely inconsistent with this Court's Fourth Amendment law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.207" offset="12016744">In closing, unless the Court has any questions--</text>

            <text syncTime="3011.145" offset="12044539">One is that the passenger had nothing to do with it, didn't know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.155" offset="12056555">Two is, everybody knew about it but that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.635" offset="12066482">And three, they knew about it and wanted to help sell the drugs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3020.433" offset="12081633">Now, she says, one plus two are so great that three isn't probable cause, but about, at least two.</text>
