            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">I have the opinion of the Court to announce in No. 02-809, Maryland against Pringle.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.345" offset="29362">The respondent, Pringle was a front seat passenger in a Nissan Maxima stopped for speeding Northwest of Baltimore about 3 O’clock a.m. by a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.692" offset="70740">There were two other occupants, the driver and the back seat passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.116" offset="88398">The officer, upon searching the car, seized $763 of rolled up cash from the glove compartment and five glassed in baggys of cocaine from between the back sit arm rest and the back seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.678" offset="146704">After all three men denied ownership of the cocaine and money the officer arrested each of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.819" offset="171259">A few hours later, Pringle confessed the ownership of the drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.940" offset="187664">The Court of Appeals of Maryland by a divided vote reversed Pringle’s conviction concluding that Pringle’s confession should have been suppressed as the fruits of an illegal arrest because the officer did not have probable cause to make a warrantless arrest to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.451" offset="257776">We granted certiorari and we now reverse the judgment of the Maryland Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.610" offset="278361">A warrantless arrest of an individual in a public place for a felony or a misdemeanor committed in the officer’s presence is consistent with the Fourth Amendment if the arrest is supported by probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.677" offset="334681">It is uncontested in the present case that the officer, upon recovering the five plastic glassine baggies containing suspected cocaine, had probable cause to believe a felony had been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.036" offset="388075">The sole question is whether the officer had probable cause to believe that Pringle committed that crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.150" offset="416496">The probable cause standard is incapable of precise definition or quantification in the percentages because it deals with probabilities and depends on the totality of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.991" offset="471876">However, the substance of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief and guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.707" offset="498730">To determine whether an officer had probable cause to arrest an individual, we examine the events leading up to the arrest and then decide whether these historical facts viewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonable police officer amount to probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.128" offset="564454">In this case, Pringle was one of three men riding a car in the early morning hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.723" offset="586815">There was $763 of rolled up cash in the glove compartment directly in front of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.793" offset="611161">Five plastic glassine baggies of cocaine were behind the back seat arm rest and accessible to all three men.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.185" offset="640731">Upon questioning, the three men failed to offer any information with respect to the ownership of the cocaine or the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.866" offset="667376">We think it is an entirely reasonable inference from these facts that any or all of the three occupants had knowledge of and exercised dominion and control over the cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.720" offset="710844">Thus, a reasonable officer could conclude that there as probable cause to believe Pringle committed the crime of possession of cocaine either solely or jointly.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.455" offset="749819">Pringle’s arrest therefore did not contravene the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.249" offset="772911">So, the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland is reversed, the case remanded for proceeding not inconsistent with this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.263" offset="801019">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
