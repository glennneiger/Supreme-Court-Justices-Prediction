            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">The opinion of the Court in No. 02-658, Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation versus the Environmental Protection Agency will be announced by Justice Ginsburg.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="11.939" offset="47752">This case concerns the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency or EPA to superintend enforcement of the Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.923" offset="95608">Two provisions of the Act expansively empower EPA to enforce any of the Act’s requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.564" offset="126224">The requirement at issue relates to the Clean Air Act's prevention of significant deterioration or PSD program.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.625" offset="166452">As its name indicates, the PSD program is designed to maintain air quality in areas still relatively free of pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.523" offset="210024">PSD provisions require receipt of a permit before constructing or modifying a large air pollutant emitting facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.913" offset="251611">To gain a permit, the applicant must show that the insulation is equipped with the best available control technology or for short, BACT.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.854" offset="303334">The Act defines BACT as the technology that results in the maximum degree of pollutant reduction achievable taking account of energy, environmental, and economic factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.558" offset="362162">The permit authority in this case, is the petitioner Alaska acting to it, Department of Environmental Conservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.152" offset="404584">The question presented, may EPA order construction stopped on a facility when EPA finds that the State permit issuing authority, here, Alaska’s Environmental Department, has unreasonably determined what si the best available technology, the BACT, for that facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.454" offset="501760">In December 1999, the Alaska Department issued a permit allowing increase production at the Red Dog Mine, a zinc mine in Northwest Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.751" offset="547004">The permit authorized additional generative capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.082" offset="568320">As the best available technology or BACT, the Alaska Agency first suggested a method found technically and economically feasible that would reduce emissions from the new installation by 90%.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.391" offset="629551">In the permit given Red Dog however, the Alaska Agency selected as BACT a different cheaper technology, one that would reduce emissions by only 30%.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.390" offset="681482">In justification of that choice, the Alaska Department said that Red Dog’s operation and competitiveness would suffer where the mine forced to use a more expensive technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.933" offset="731638">The Alaska Agency acknowledged however, that it could reach no judgment on the economic factors it was to take into account because the mine had refused to provide the State Agency with relevant financial data.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.967" offset="791824">EPA found that the State Agency’s choice of emission control technology lacked evidentiary support and was therefore, unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.643" offset="830485">Invoking its statutory enforcement authority, EPA ordered the Red Dog operators to stop construction of the additional generator at the mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.953" offset="871758">The State Agency contested both EPA’s authority to issue stop construction orders in general, and EPA’s determination in this case, that the Alaska Department’s choice of emission control technology was unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.154" offset="932571">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit both upheld the Federal Agency’s assertion of supervisory authority generally and concluded in this case that EPA had legitimately exercised its authority when it ordered the Red Dog Mine to stop construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.287" offset="1001117">We affirm the Ninth Circuit’s judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.073" offset="1016268">The Act does not give state permit issuing authorities untethered discretion, rather it confines the State Agency’s choices by directing that an emission control technology selected as BACT must yield the maximum achievable reduction in pollutants taking account of practical considerations listed in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.524" offset="1106024">For reasons detailed in the Court’s opinion, we find the Federal Agency’s reading of the Act fitting and proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.457" offset="1133819">We therefore, hold that EPA can exercise its supervisory power to block a facility's construction when a state permit issuing authority makes a BACT determination untethered to the Clean Air Act's guide and the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.824" offset="1203200">We further conclude that EPA properly exercised its authority when it stopped construction at the Red Dog Mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.753" offset="1234965">As EPA found, the Alaska Department’s own records showed that there was scant of any evidentiary basis for choosing the less stringent emission reduction technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.843" offset="1287314">It remains open to the Alaska Agency however, if that agency elects, to revisit the matter and to establish in the renewed proceedings a satisfactory evidentiary basis for its BACT determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.574" offset="1350217">Justice Kennedy has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas joined.</text>
