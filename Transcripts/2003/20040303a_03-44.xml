            <text syncTime="1107.791" offset="4431099">I recognize that the Commerce Clause could also provide a basis for Congress to reach transactions involving criminal activity that affect commerce, but this Court in Salinas v. United States, in describing why section 666 was constitutional, as applied to the facts of that case, discussed that there was a legitimate Federal interest in protecting the particular program that corruption had affected in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.151" offset="4560562">And the outgrowth of section 666 historically is of an effort by Congress to improve on previously deficient methods of protecting federally funded programs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1382.578" offset="5530227">I believe the Court could uphold the statute as a regulation of interstate commerce, but it was clearly not designed with that in mind, and this Court did not so regard it, or at least didn't articulate itself as regarding it that way in Salinas v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.471" offset="5593861">The problem that Congress was trying to solve was a very particularized problem, not the generalized problem of there is crime in America, therefore it will affect federally funded activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.178" offset="5636702">The problem that Congress was trying to solve was that it would give Federal money to particular entities to... to administer Federal programs, and there would be crime that had the potential to affect those Federal interests, but because of deficiencies or perceived deficiencies in prior statutory law, that crime could not be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.967" offset="5719771">In particular, with theft crimes there was a problem because once title had passed with the money to the local entity or State entity, some courts were saying that was no longer theft from the Federal Government and the theft statute didn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.078" offset="5780271">With respect to the Federal bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. 201, lower courts had divided on whether State and local officials who were administering Federal programs could be held accountable as Federal officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.452" offset="5833770">And to remedy those deficiencies of prior law, section 666, as the court of appeals I think aptly described it, changed the enforcement paradigm, and it said that what we want now is not to focus on particular Federal monies that we have difficulty tracing into federally funded entities or who is a Federal official.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.771" offset="5910988">We want to make sure that the entities that we fund to carry out Federal assistance programs are clean, and the way that we are going to do that is to draft a prophylactic statute that ensures that all agents who are involved in the authority to conduct business on behalf of the entity are not engaged in significant acts of theft, embezzlement, or bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.982" offset="6015896">It, therefore, included various limitations in section 666 that prevent it from being an all-encompassing, all-devouring statute that sweeps in all related crimes to the entities that are funded.</text>

            <text syncTime="1954.111" offset="7816359">18 U.S.C., section 201 was the Federal bribery statute that primarily focuses on people who are Federal officials or who are designated to become Federal officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.371" offset="7865469">And this Court in United States v. Dixson interpreted the statute to cover State and local officials who were administering Federal programs because they were acting on behalf of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.034" offset="7920118">And with respect to that branch of section 201, although the Court did not address the constitutional question in Dixson, I think that the proper grant of authority to analyze it is the Necessary and Proper Clause as applied to the spending power because it, like section 666, criminalizes the activities of non-US persons because they are engaged in an activity that relates to federally funded programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.784" offset="8027115">So the theory of protecting through criminal law the misdeeds of agents that may impair Federal programs or impair Federal funds is not new.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.961" offset="8075807">What was new about section 666 was its removal of the impediments that Congress found in the prior law so that it could have an effective mechanism to ensure the integrity of its programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.759" offset="8127007">The case that is before the Court today is a facial challenge to section 666, arguing that it is always and everywhere unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.790" offset="8167131">That submission is impossible to reconcile with this Court's decision in Salinas v. United States which specifically said that as applied to the conduct in that case, where there was a connection to a Federal program, the statute was constitutional as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.342" offset="8233273">What that means is that the court of appeals was clearly correct in holding that section 666 is not facially unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.509" offset="8269949">It leaves open whether there is an as-applied constitutional challenge to section 666.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.657" offset="8294609">No such challenge was brought in this case, and the United States made a proffer to the district court indicating how the particular bribery in this case would have had an effect on Federal funds and Federal programs, making clear that no such as-applied challenge would have succeeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.746" offset="8362945">So the only way that petitioner can prevail in this case if this Court is prepared to say that notwithstanding its prior decision in Salinas, holding that section 666 was constitutional as applied, it now turns out that section 666 is facially unconstitutional and can never be applied to anyone anywhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="2211.021" offset="8844016">The Court would have two options open to it if it decided, contrary to our arguments today, to read in some sort of a nexus requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.163" offset="8872647">It could do what the Second and Third Circuits have done, which is, we think incorrectly, superimpose on the statute as an implicit element that has no textual foundation some sort of a Federal nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.711" offset="8922802">Now, if the Court did construe section 666 to require a Federal nexus, that's clearly a jury issue under United States v. Gaudin.</text>

            <text syncTime="2293.376" offset="9173473">Well, so long, Justice Ginsburg, as the statutory valuation elements are met, that the transaction involves $5,000 or more, which it probably would, given teacher salaries, then it would be covered by section 666, and the Government would have discretion to prosecute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.324" offset="9249228">I think what that illustrates is that the broad prophylactic approach that section 666 takes leads easily to the manufacturing of hypotheticals that seem attenuated from core Federal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.577" offset="9302204">And the choice that Congress had before it was to draft a statute that would go to that degree of breadth but eliminate impediments that had previously hobbled the enforcement of a law or draft a statute which Congress believed was both under-inclusive and would put to the jury perhaps difficult and murky issues of whether there really was a Federal connection that justified application of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.982" offset="9395827">And let me give an example because it's a very important, classic example of the way that we use section 666.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.388" offset="9417456">Suppose that there is a city council person or a mayor or some other official who has responsibilities for some respect... in some respects administering a Federal program or Federal funds, and he turns out to be engaged in corruption with respect to non-Federal monies and non-Federal programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.533" offset="9498122">The Government wants to prosecute him to ensure that he doesn't begin to widen his field of operation and harm the Federal program, but in the facts that can actually be proved, there's no connection between the Federal program and the offense conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.644" offset="9558518">Conceivably could a statute be drafted that would allow the Government to say that's the kind of Federal nexus that's covered?</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.876" offset="9583491">Certainly, but there are many, many hypotheticals where the potential injury to Federal interests is not necessarily going to be easy to articulate and prove to a jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2436.000" offset="9743987">If it's a question of law, is the statute unconstitutional as applied, then the defendant should have the burden of establishing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.853" offset="9771363">But I understood Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical to raise the question what if Congress had drafted a narrower statute that had some sort of an offense nexus element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.232" offset="9804904">Then we'd have to prove it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.347" offset="9809293">The United States Attorneys Manual does direct prosecutors to use 666 in cases where there's a substantial and identifiable Federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.635" offset="9846491">So what you have here is a combination of Congress saying we need a statute that's adequate to vindicate Federal interests and prior efforts to draft narrower ones have frustrated that goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.402" offset="9893512">We're going to draft a broader statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.093" offset="9900304">And then the Federal executive branch uses its discretion to prosecute cases that do, indeed, pose a real threat to Federal interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.238" offset="9944921">Now, that's as a matter of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.467" offset="9953802">It's not as a matter of constitutional law, and it's not as a matter of what the statute provides.</text>
