            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">The second case I have to announce is Tennessee against Lane.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.555" offset="26122">Respondents are paraplegics who use wheelchairs for mobility.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.161" offset="44617">They claim that the State of Tennessee has failed to provide them with reasonable access to several County courthouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.016" offset="80039">They have filed suit against the State and a number of its counties pursuant to Title II of the American with Disabilities Act, which forbids public entities from discriminating against persons with disabilities in the administration of public services.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.799" offset="147122">They sought both money damages and equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.155" offset="164571">The State moved to dismiss the suit invoking the State’s Eleventh Amendment immunity from private suits for money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.042" offset="204069">The District Court denied the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.830" offset="215249">While the case was pending on appeal, this Court issued its decision in Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama against Garrett which held that the Eleventh Amendment bars private suits for money damages under Title I of the ADA, the Title that prohibits employment discrimination against the disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.736" offset="294870">Garrett left opened the question whether suits for money damages are permitted under Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.864" offset="319425">In answering that question in this case, the Sixth Circuit held that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar respondent’s suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.165" offset="348578">We granted certiorari and now affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.428" offset="361639">It is well settled that Congress can abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity when it acts pursuant to its authority under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce the substantive guarantees of that Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.592" offset="414302">The primary question in this case is whether Title II constitutes a valid exercise of Congress Section 5 power.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.947" offset="447739">In Garrett, we held that Title I was not a valid section five enforcement legislation because its broad remedial scheme was insufficiently targeted to remedy or prevent constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.397" offset="509492">We concluded that disability based classification are valid under the Fourteenth Amendment if they bare a rational relationship to a legitimate government purpose and if the states were not engaging in a pattern of irrational employment discrimination against the disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.618" offset="586397">Title II differs from Title I in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.476" offset="605832">Whereas Title I aims primarily at employment discrimination in the private sector, Title II aims that the whole range of public services in the public sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.155" offset="652539">Most important, it seeks to enforce not only the constitutional prohibition on an irrational discrimination but also a number of other fundamental constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.326" offset="697260">Infringements of these rights, including the right of access to the courts, that is at issue in this case, are subject to a heightened standard of judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.573" offset="738220">Moreover, Congress had ample reason to think that legislative action was needed to remedy or prevent violation of these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.958" offset="771762">Judicial decisions, the legislative records, congressional hearing testimony, and anecdotal evidence, all describe a pattern of pervasive unequal treatment of the disabled in the administration of public services and programs including the systematic deprivation of fundamental constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.357" offset="857339">The question then is whether Title II is, in the language of this Court’s Section 5 cases, a congruent and proportional response to this pattern of discriminatory treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.154" offset="904568">Title II, unlike other statutes we have reviewed for validity under Section five, does not seek to enforce just one constitutional provision but reaches a wide array of official conduct in an effort to enforce an equally wide array of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.953" offset="971755">We therefore go no further than the precise question that this case presents.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.887" offset="991504">Whether Title II appropriately enforces the constitutional right have access to the court?</text>
            <text syncTime="253.552" offset="1014178">We hold that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.369" offset="1021388">Title II requires public entities to make reasonable modifications to permit persons with disabilities to participate in judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.822" offset="1063288">This duty to make reasonable accommodations is perfectly consistent with the well-establish principle that states must afford all individuals a meaningful right to be heard in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.998" offset="1111980">So, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.366" offset="1125460">Justice Souter has filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Ginsburg joined: Justice Ginsburg has also filed a concurring opinion in which Justice Souter and Justice Breyer joined; The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion which Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas joined; Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas have also filed dissenting opinions.</text>
