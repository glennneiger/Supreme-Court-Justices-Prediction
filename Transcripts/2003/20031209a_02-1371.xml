            <text syncTime="51.620" offset="206472">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="54.304" offset="217130">Miranda's core ruling is that an unwarned statement may not be used in the prosecution's case in chief to prove guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.158" offset="244611">In this case, the prosecution did not seek to admit an unwarned statement, rather the statement that was offered was preceded by a meticulous recitation of Miranda warnings, an express waiver of rights, and was the product of non-coercive questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.521" offset="310021">A fully warned and otherwise voluntary statement is not tainted by the existence of a prior unwarned statement even if the officer intentionally initiated questioning without warning and that is true for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.001" offset="363938">First, because an officer's intent does not render the unwarned statement actually involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.924" offset="387657">The unwarned statement is merely presumptively compelled, and once warnings are administered, that presumption ends and the suspect has the information necessary to make a knowing and intelligent decision about waiver.</text>

            <text syncTime="109.601" offset="438335">You say the second warning removes the presumption as to the earlier unwarned statement.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="130.383" offset="521509">And is that true if the... if the conversation after the warnings includes interrogation about what he said before?</text>

            <label>Ms. Karen K. Mitchell</label>
            <text syncTime="136.616" offset="546377">--It would depend on how that happened, but under the facts of this case, yes, it would still remain true.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.476" offset="569887">There are essentially... under Miranda, there are two elements that we have to look at in determining whether a statement is admissible, and that is whether you have a knowing, intelligent, voluntary waiver and whether the statement is in fact voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.496" offset="621923">If there is a reference back, as there was in this case to the previous statement, it could be a problem if that is part of the waiver element.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.852" offset="655360">And I believe that's what this Court indicated in Elstad itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.446" offset="669780">If the officer used that in a way that affected the knowing nature then of what the... the information that was imparted and made the waiver therefore defective, it may be problematic.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.827" offset="719308">However, as in this case, where there's simply a reference back during the... the questioning, after there is a waiver and a decision to go forward, that alone does not affect the voluntariness of that subsequent statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.458" offset="877819">The difficulty I have with the argument is the premise that you state... is in accepting the premise that you state, and that is that a second interrogation that falls on the heels of the first... here, I think there was a 20-minute break... can really be separated as a matter of simple psychology.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.551" offset="962142">I... I have difficulty in accepting the plausibility of a conclusion that the... that the ostensible waiver in the second case is really a free waiver as distinct from sort of throwing up one's hands and saying it's too late to say no now.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.168" offset="1044584">It's the... it... there's a basic implausibility in your case.</text>

            <label>Ms. Karen K. Mitchell</label>
            <text syncTime="268.599" offset="1074364">Well, first, Elstad addressed that exact issue and came to the opposite conclusion.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="273.762" stopTime="306.101">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="273.762" offset="1094949">But... but Elstad... I mean, let me... and maybe that's the way I should have focused the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.310" offset="1109159">In... in Elstad, you did not have a... let's say, a... a systematic questioning of the... of the sort that went on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.373" offset="1153463">Here the... the police did, indeed, engage in a kind of first-round interrogation, and the... the intensity of their pressure to get answers in this case seems to me qualitatively different from Elstad.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="karen_k_mitchell" startTime="306.101" stopTime="336.920">
            <label>Ms. Karen K. Mitchell</label>
            <text syncTime="306.101" offset="1224307">It is different, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.198" offset="1228696">There clearly is a continuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.518" offset="1234024">But the appropriate question is whether the first statement was involuntary or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.438" offset="1249698">If in fact that questioning and that pressure had been great enough to make that first statement involuntary, then absolutely it would create the kind of taint that could carry forward even after subsequent warnings were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.205" offset="1296718">I think that is the lesson of Elstad.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.979" offset="1303824">But Elstad draws that distinction between actual coercion and presumptive coercion, and where it is merely presumptive... it does not rise to the level of actual... then that does not carry forward.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.920" offset="1347605">But that's... comparatively speaking, I... I think maybe that was... that was relatively easy to tell in Elstad.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.153" offset="1372578">Here, it's going to be a serious issue, and it seems to me that in order to litigate this issue as the threshold issue to determining whether the second waiver or as part of the litigation as to whether the... the ostensible waiver really is a waiver and the second statement really is voluntary, we're right back in the morass of litigation, which is one of the principal objects of Miranda to avoid in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.985" offset="1479889">We... we said, look, this... this litigation is very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.866" offset="1495458">It's difficult to engage in this litigation and produce a... a clear and reliable answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.759" offset="1522939">It seems to me that... that the position you take forces us right back into that litigation position that we tried to get away from in Miranda itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1042.771" offset="4171024">An officer's failure to give Miranda warnings before taking an initial statement does not presumptively taint the admissibility of a subsequent statement that has been preceded by Miranda warnings and an express waiver of Miranda rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.864" offset="4231419">And the reason is that the risk of compulsion that is inherent in unwarned custodial interrogation and that makes the first statement inadmissible is counteracted once Miranda warnings have been given.</text>

            <text syncTime="1098.193" offset="4392751">And the... the fact of intentionality adds nothing to the level of compulsion that is experienced by the suspect during the initial interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.308" offset="4433189">It adds nothing to the psychological force that operates on the suspect who has confessed once as a result of unwarned... during unwarned questioning and the giving and subsequent administration of Miranda warnings is no less effective in providing the information that is necessary to make a knowing and voluntary decision--</text>

            <text syncTime="1131.221" offset="4524826">That's... that's what's not clear to me, that... that... it seems to me you're absolutely on the right track in saying that Miranda has, as one of its basic purposes, dealing with cases where there may or may not be compulsion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1142.921" offset="4571638">And this gets rid of the risk, so that that's a very good way of describing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.529" offset="4590028">And then it seems to me in this kind of case we have two risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.237" offset="4608940">One was the risk that really it was compelled... the first statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.157" offset="4624614">And second is the risk that really that first statement does lead to the second confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.913" offset="4647602">And so to obviate those risks, would it make sense to say in any case where the police knowingly or reasonably should have known they're supposed to give Miranda warnings in the first case, you can use the second statement but only if the government shows that, first of all, that first one wasn't compelled?</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.732" offset="4734851">Second, it shows that the Miranda warning was given before the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.882" offset="4759510">And third, it shows that a time has to have elapsed sufficient to make that Miranda warning reasonable, reasonably cutting the causal connection that you want it to cut.</text>

            <text syncTime="1229.308" offset="4917185">Now let me address your question about reasonable and knowing and whether that should make a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.231" offset="4940904">The fact that the warnings were known, that... that this was a custodial interrogation situation, the fact that the officer may have been unreasonable in thinking it was not... neither of those adds anything to the level of compulsion that is experienced by the suspect during the initial--</text>

            <text syncTime="3154.149" offset="12616516">Ms. Bartholow, you... you've asserted that the question presented is not... is not really accurate, that... that the Missouri court, in fact, had found that given the totality of the circumstances, one of which was the intentional failure to give Miranda warnings, the second statement was... was coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.089" offset="12720274">And I find that in fact that your brief in opposition did make that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3194.107" offset="12776385">Would... do you think it presents the question at least of whether the intentional failure to give a Miranda warning is one of the factors properly considered in determining whether the second confession is voluntary or not?</text>

            <text syncTime="3215.699" offset="12862694">I don't... I don't think the Court should proceed on the assumption that the initial statement was voluntary, and that is... that's always been our first line of defense, is that this wasn't a voluntary statement because under Elstad... under Elstad the Court said that when a suspect is being subjected to a coercive environment or where the manner of the questioning in the case is coercive, then the standard Elstad rule doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.792" offset="12983066">And... and especially because when Justice Brennan tried to posit this two-step interrogation that it would become all the rage and specifically... I mean, the description of Justice Brennan's two-step interrogation mirrors this... this exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.428" offset="13049626">This Court said that's apocalyptic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.385" offset="13057463">We are not encouraging that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.583" offset="13062269">We do not want police officers or prosecutors to... to use that tactic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.898" offset="13087556">And... and unfortunately, I believe law enforcement took the invitation of Justice Brennan's dissent perhaps and didn't listen to what you said in the majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.672" offset="13130606">I think this tactic is bad for the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.523" offset="13141995">It is bad for suspects, and it is bad for courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3290.707" offset="13162789">And the test that we would ask you to apply is that when police officers deliberately withhold Miranda in order to elicit an incriminating response when they knew or should have known that Miranda was required, then the second statement will be presumed compelled unless and until the State can show that it has been attenuated from the first.</text>

            <text syncTime="3347.483" offset="13389845">The... the woman would feel just as coerced whether the failure to give it was... was intentional or non-intentional it seems to me.</text>

            <text syncTime="3375.801" offset="13503112">If the officer intends to disrespect those rights and leave the Fifth Amendment unprotected, then I think there's a grave danger that they will use tactics that they used here, that they will refer to the unwarned statement to pressure the waiver, that they will refer to the unwarned statement to get the second statement, and that there will never be an exercise of the suspect's free will.</text>

            <text syncTime="3461.894" offset="13847510">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.720" offset="13850854">On the issue of systematic interrogation that came up several times during the argument, that is relevant only if it rises to the level of making that first statement actually involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.345" offset="13905293">And I think that's clear from the Elstad opinion itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.233" offset="13916891">At one point during the Elstad opinion, specifically in footnote 2 of the majority opinion, the Court is talking about lower court decisions where the... the lower court did not apply the attenuation-type doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.038" offset="13964121">And referring to some of those cases as involving, quote, clearly voluntary, unwarned admissions, the Court then goes on and cites a number of cases that involve actual station house interrogations, in many cases much longer than the interrogation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.982" offset="14023889">Specifically, I'd point the Court to the Derrico decision cited in Elstad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.797" offset="14039144">So just the idea that you have a traditional station house-type interrogation is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.187" offset="14060669">The question is, does it render the first statement involuntary and therefore capable of tainting the second statement?</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.246" offset="14088882">In this case the question of voluntariness of each statement was raised in the initial motion to suppress, and even though there were not extensive findings by the trial court, they denied those motions to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.103" offset="14132349">And that issue was not raised again in either of the appellate courts in Missouri, and the Missouri Supreme Court did not reach that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.707" offset="14158785">On the question of what the Missouri Supreme Court held, three points I think are very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.703" offset="14178743">The court starts out by phrasing or... or characterizing its decision as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.328" offset="14197238">Essential to the inquiry is whether the presumption that the first statement was involuntary carries over to the second statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.137" offset="14224509">The court then goes on and throughout the opinion makes the decision to, in fact, carry that presumption forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.810" offset="14247184">It focuses on intent and finds intent to be an improper tactic, as this Court used that phrase in Elstad, which is the predicate then for applying a fruits-type analysis and requiring attenuation, which is exactly what the Missouri Supreme Court does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.230" offset="14308833">And that is why we sought cert in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.997" offset="14319909">As to this... the... the apocalyptic issue and Justice Brennan's discussion in Elstad, Justice Brennan talked about a number of situations, including the application of Miranda to the Fourth Amendment, including the use of statements by police officers to garner a waiver which did not happen here, and other things that are simply inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.629" offset="14406426">This case is not that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.434" offset="14417711">Finally, what we are asking this Court to do is to reverse the Missouri court decision that focused on intent, deterrence, and the carrying forward of the presumption to taint the subsequent statement because each of those findings are inconsistent with this Court's holding in Elstad, and instead to apply the framework of Elstad to this case and to reverse.</text>
