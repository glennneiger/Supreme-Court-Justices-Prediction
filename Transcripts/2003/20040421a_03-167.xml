            <text syncTime="186.770" offset="746998">In... in the ineffective assistance of counsel context, one reason for putting a high... you know, the heaviest burden on the defendant is that it is so very difficult to police effective assistance as you go along.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.462" offset="805825">The judge watching the... the plea hearing has no way of knowing what's going on or has gone on between the lawyer and... and the client.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.337" offset="853264">There... there are a couple of people in a position to... to avoid the kind of problem that we've got here.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.693" offset="882730">One obviously is the Federal judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.076" offset="892238">If he had a checklist in front of him, something like this wouldn't have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.113" offset="908434">The second is counsel for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.065" offset="924212">The counsel for the Government can get up in a case like this and say, Judge, you forgot something, and avoid this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.738" offset="954932">So it may be that because there are easier ways to avoid this, the burden on the defendant shouldn't have to be so heavy.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.610" offset="990354">What do you say to that?</text>

            <label>Mr. Dan Himmelfarb</label>
            <text syncTime="248.826" offset="995265">Well, this Court's decision makes clear in Vonn that the defendant has a burden, of course, rejected the contention in that case that no matter when... regardless of the circumstances of when a rule 11 error occurs, the Government bears the burden of showing that there was no effect on substantial rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.238" offset="1064856">The holding of Vonn is that the defendant bears the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.274" offset="1077081">The only question in this case is what that standard is, and we think again it's directly analogous to the ineffective assistance of counsel context.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.991" offset="1179899">Well, if... if that's so, Olano's fourth prong, if you will, is that the error... asks whether the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.601" offset="1246354">And I'm not sure that I understand, under your test, how that fourth prong would be applied or if it's still part of the test.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dan Himmelfarb</label>
            <text syncTime="321.475" offset="1285851">--It certainly is, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.324" offset="1293270">We make two alternative arguments, one under the third prong of the plain error rule, one under the fourth.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.478" offset="1317825">Our primary submission is that in order to satisfy the requirement of the plain error rule... in other words, in order to show an effect on substantial rights... that's right... a defendant has to show that the error affected his decision to plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.322" offset="1373205">Our alternative argument is that the Court... even if the Ninth Circuit standard is correct so that a defendant would not have to show that the error affected his decision to plead guilty in order to show an effect on substantial rights and he could therefore satisfy the third requirement of the plain error rule, he can't satisfy the fourth requirement unless he makes that showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.020" offset="1464007">And we think that conclusion follows from this Court's decisions in Cotton and Johnson where the Court assumed, without deciding, that the failure to submit an element of the offense to the grand jury or the petit jury affected substantial rights, but held that the defendant could not satisfy the fourth requirement of the plain error rule because the error had no effect on the outcome of the grand jury proceeding or of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.385" offset="1561496">So we're making two alternative arguments here, one under the--</text>

            <text syncTime="399.157" offset="1596604">And you're asking the Court to choose... well, the plain error is what we're doing and how high a burden the defendant would have to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.565" offset="1642162">But this relates to a question Justice Souter asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.351" offset="1657313">I was surprised, given that this was not a new district judge, that she didn't have a litany that would cover all the rule 11 elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.425" offset="1705691">And I was also surprised that the Assistant U.S. Attorney didn't say at the end of the colloquy, judge, you forgot to mention that this plea can't be withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.916" offset="1755638">Is there a manual that judges follow?</text>
            <text syncTime="442.968" offset="1771833">Are U.S.... Assistant U.S. Attorneys instructed, when something is left out of rule 11, to remind the judge?</text>

            <text syncTime="449.538" offset="1798060">--Justice Ginsburg, my understanding is that there is a bench book available to judges, and obviously there are a great many district judges in the United States district courts and some are going to be more meticulous than others.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.696" offset="1850723">Assistant U.S. Attorneys often or at least are supposed to bring checklists with them to a guilty plea proceeding so that they can ensure that rule 11 is strictly complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.503" offset="1901923">Of course, a prosecutor has no more interest in litigating a rule 11 error on appeal than anybody else does.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.109" offset="1936405">So it's very much in the prosecutor's interest to try to ensure that there's strict compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.496" offset="1953959">Vonn makes clear, though, that in the event that one of the... one of the advisements slips... and there was only one here that the district judge did not give... it's the defendant's burden to object and if he doesn't, he's in a plain error posture on appeal, not a harmless error posture.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.297" offset="6141179">I have three points to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.149" offset="6148493">First, Olano created a framework that the lower courts have been consistently applying... applying in evaluating forfeited errors in a rule 11 context for 11 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.706" offset="6190811">Second, now having suffered an adverse ruling in a fact-specific case, the Government is urging this Court to adopt a strict, heavy burden, bright line, but-for prejudice test in every case that eliminates the lower court's flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.982" offset="6255909">Third, not only is the Government's test incorrect, but the Ninth Circuit cited and applied Olano and was consistent with Olano in Benitez.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.922" offset="6295615">Now, first, the Olano standard is a national standard under plain error review where an error affects the substantial rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.130" offset="6336470">And that means... generally is taken to mean it's prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.347" offset="6353293">And in most cases prejudice means that it affects the outcome of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.151" offset="6372519">In Benitez, this is what the Ninth Circuit held as well because in Benitez, if it's not minor or technical, that means it's prejudicial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3287.709" offset="13150772">And it's counterintuitive to enter into an agreement when you understand that one party could withdraw, to think that you can't.</text>
