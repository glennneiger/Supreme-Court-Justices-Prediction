            <text syncTime="69.295" offset="277107">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="72.330" offset="289228">Unlike the Hamdi case, which raised not only the question of the President's and the military's authority to detain, but also questions the process and access to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.269" offset="329038">This case raises only two relatively discrete questions, first, whether the habeas petition in this case, challenging Hamdi's present physical confinement in South Carolina, was properly filed in Manhattan, rather than against the immediate custodian in South Carolina, and second, whether the President has the authority to detain a citizen who travels abroad, affiliates and associates with the enemy abroad, receives training in enemy camps in wiring and explosives and then returns to the United States at the direction of the enemy to commit hostile and warlike acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.994" offset="487967">Now, there are many aspects of this case that raise issues that are really extraordinary, but the habeas petition that was filed in this case was a standard, indeed ordinary, use of the writ to challenge the prisoner's present physical confinement and the habeas rules are settled that when the writ is used to challenge the present physical confinement, the proper custodian, the proper respondent, is the immediate custodian and the suit should be filed in the district where that custodian is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.930" offset="607713">In other words, in a case to your present physical confinement, the case should be filed in the district of confinement.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.879" offset="695484">Now, I think in that case, there would still be a question, especially if there was the, the habeas petition was filed and he was immediately removed, there would still be the question of venue at that point and there is a Seventh Circuit case hat's not in the briefs but Ross against Menday that you may want to look at that says that in a case like that presumptively--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="216.455" offset="865802">Jurisdiction under the Habeas Statutes has been a bit of a confusion because, for instance, on behalf of aliens, I think we have allowed jurisdiction to be obtained in the manner it was here, have we not?</text>

            <text syncTime="233.250" offset="932989">I don't know which case have you in mind, but I'm aware of no case of this Court that takes the unprecedented step that the court below took, which is basically to allow a habeas petition to go forward in a case where neither the prisoner nor the custodian is in the jurisdiction where the habeas petition is filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.262" offset="1008953">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, as I was suggesting to Justice Stevens, that case involves a kind of unique situation where a habeas petition is filed, challenging a certain kind of confinement, and then after the petition is filed, and after jurisdiction attaches, the prisoner is moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.442" offset="1081678">In that case, it was an individual moved from California to--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="272.642" offset="1090560">They never, they never named any custodian in that case, did they?</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="277.096" stopTime="328.129">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="277.096" offset="1108323">--Well, I don't know for sure, Mr. Chief Justice, but I would say a couple of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.000" offset="1127967">One is on the immediate custodian rule, I think that is a rule that perhaps the government could waive in a case, and so if you have a situation--</text>
            <text syncTime="290.773" offset="1163076">In a way Hamdi is that case where when the habeas petition in Hamdi was filed, he was being detained in Norfolk, which was in the Eastern District of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.359" offset="1197349">It did not matter in that case whether the immediate custodian was Paulette, who is the brig, the commander of the brig, or Rumsfeld because in the government's view, they are both territorially present in the Eastern District of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.852" offset="1247399">So the immediate custodian rule I think is something that government can waive.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.404" offset="1261610">I don't think that the territorial jurisdiction limit on the courts, though, is something that the government is in a position to waive.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.308" offset="1289195">I think that is a restriction on the power of the court to issue the writ of habeas, and again, as I was indicating--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="328.129" stopTime="333.366">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="328.129" offset="1312496">Well, is there a circuit split on whether aliens can name the attorney general?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="333.366" stopTime="398.791">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="333.366" offset="1333394">--Yes, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.968" offset="1343843">There is a circuit split on that issue, and I think in some ways that issue is sort of tied up with this case, though even there as I understand most of those cases, there is a case from the Ninth Circuit called Armantero, which in the government's view goes the wrong way.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.311" offset="1401208">There is favorable precedent in the Sixth Circuit, the First Circuit, and the Seventh Circuit, but even the Ninth Circuit, I think, envisions a case where they view the attorney general as the proper custodian, but they, you know, it's not clear where they think that individual can be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.885" offset="1455438">Now, I suppose that the Ninth Circuit applying that rule might also take the unprecedented step here.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.189" offset="1476754">It's also true if you want a sort of sense of the potential for abuse in these cases, I think could you point to the Ninth Circuit case where the Ninth Circuit held that the Central District of California had habeas jurisdiction over a claim filed by a petitioner in Guantanamo.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.282" offset="1541120">I mean, obviously there is the issue that this Court has, but there is a question of if there were jurisdiction, I wouldn't have thought that it lay in the Central District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.220" offset="1572780">And I think that happens when you relax these traditional rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.439" offset="1589708">And I think particularly in a case like--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="398.791" stopTime="403.243">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="398.791" offset="1595141">Where does jurisdiction lie for someone in Guantanamo, do you suppose?</text>

          <turn speaker="paul_d_clement" startTime="403.243" stopTime="407.730">
            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="403.243" offset="1612904">--Well, if, let me answer the question this way, which is if you had a citizen in Guantanamo.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="407.730" stopTime="408.347">

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="408.347" offset="1633384">And under this Court's cases like Toth against Quarles and Burns against Wilson, that citizen is unable to file a habeas petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.068" offset="1660238">Our view is that the proper place to file that would be either in the Eastern District of Virginia, if you were naming the Secretary of Defense or if were you naming some official present in the district, you would sue in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.859" offset="1707363">But the important thing is even in that case, the court where you filed the petition would have jurisdiction, territorial jurisdiction over the Respondent and what is so anomalous here is in a sense, it doesn't, I mean it matters to us in the sense that we think the proper Respondent is Commander Marr, but even if you assume the proper Respondent here is secretary Rumsfeld, the case still shouldn't be brought in the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.009" offset="1807987">It should be brought in the Eastern District of Virginia.</text>

            <text syncTime="463.651" offset="1854589">I think it only makes sense to have the defense mounted in the place where the detention is taking place.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.555" offset="1878204">And I think that's particularly true in this case, because this isn't a petition that only challenges the fact of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.208" offset="1904744">If you look at the, the petition in this case, the amended petition, joint appendix page 56, the relief that's sought here also goes to the conditions of confinement in Commander Marr's brig.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.980" offset="1947899">Now, in a case like that, it seems--</text>

            <text syncTime="518.718" offset="2074854">There is no question that Federal courts have habeas jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.522" offset="2098051">They have that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.807" offset="2107141">And you are talking about not the large question, what kind of case can a Federal court hear, you are talking about a where question, not a what question.</text>

            <text syncTime="539.632" offset="2158446">I mean, unless the word essentially is going to bear a tremendous amount of weight, I disagree because I think that what you have here is not general venue principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.340" offset="2197316">You have a situation where the relevant statute that gives courts habeas jurisdiction restricts their ability to issue the writ to their territorial jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.760" offset="2230962">And this Court has been clear in cases like Carbo and this is even consistent in Justice Rutledge's dissent in the Ahrens case, that for that provision to have any meaning at an irreducible minimum, it has to mean that a writ that goes to the proper custodian has to be filed within the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="592.667" offset="2370664">And this Court decided that in Endo long before Ahrens when it reaffirmed an even stricter rule and there is nothing in the post-Ahrens cases that suggests that this Court has ever deviated from this understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.324" offset="2417267">And indeed I would point the Court to the decision in Schlanger against Seamans, because I think in some ways, it shows how, that that case really decided this issue, because what the court there had was an individual who was trying to get ROTC scholarship in Arizona, but he was assigned to a unit in Alabama, and he filed his habeas petition in Arizona, and he named as Respondents an individual in Arizona who had no custody over him whatsoever, so that individual was out.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.743" offset="2534922">He also named the Secretary of the Air Force.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.445" offset="2545685">The court did not rely on that, and the court said that his true custodian is his commanding officer in Georgia, and what this Court said is there was no jurisdiction in Arizona over that custodian in Georgia, and just to be clear about it, the Court noted and rejected an argument based on 28 U.S.C. 1391(e), which among other things provides nationwide service of process against Federal officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.161" offset="2640562">Now, if that statute had applied, then it would have been perfectly appropriate to bring the case in Arizona against a Georgia Respondent who was a Federal officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.000" offset="2675984">But the Court said no. 1391(e) does not trump the habeas statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.320" offset="2697195">Now, if that is true of a Federal statute that provides for nationwide service of process, it seems like it would be true a fortiori for Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.211" offset="2740767">But that's the theory under which the courts below exercised jurisdiction in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="695.767" offset="2782981">And I think the best evidence of that, there is two things I'd like to point to.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.369" offset="2797401">But maybe the simplest way is that both Strait and Braden cite Schlanger favorably and, indeed, if you look at the very end of the Braden opinion, when the court says that the proper Respondent there is within the court's service of process, it sites Schlanger for that proposition, which makes sense because in that case the petition was properly filed, challenging a Kentucky detainer in Kentucky, so the proper Respondent was within the territorial jurisdiction of the court in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.705" offset="2910772">The second reason I would say that Schlanger is very much good law as we pointed out in our reply brief, is that the court in Schlanger went out of its way, because at that point, Ahrens was sort of already teetering on the verge of obsolescence, to state that the rule would be exactly the same even under Justice Rutledge's view in Ahrens, so I think for those two reasons, Schlanger continues to be good law, and clearly would trump any service of process that would be provided by Rule 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.891" offset="3023517">And I think, and this is consistent with what the unanimous three-judge court in the Fourth Circuit said in the Hamdi case, that particularly in cases that raise such sensitive issues as the cases that are involved on the merits in this case, it is particularly important that the court try to avoid unnecessarily reaching Constitutional issues by first ascertaining that it has jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="856.507" offset="3426011">I think that this Court, it is true, in situations where it has relaxed the notion of custody, and has allowed habeas petitions to be brought in circumstances where they previously weren't available, Strait against Laird is an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.231" offset="3480869">This Court's decision in Braden, basically is an example because it was accommodating the overruling of McNally against Hill and Payton against Rowe.</text>

            <text syncTime="1396.022" offset="5584039">But I think that the practical reason is if you capture somebody who is not just somebody who is guilty of a war crime or a violation of some provision of Title 18, but also has a wealth of information that could be used to prevent future terrorist attacks, then it seems to me that the military ought to have the option of proceeding with him in a way that allows him to get actionable intelligence to prevent future terrorist attacks, and should not be forced into a choice where the only way they can proceed is to proceed retrospectively to try to punish him for past acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1601.540" offset="6406060">But what I would... just to be clear, I think as we point out in our reply brief, if you applied a clear statement rule to Quirin, it would have to come out the other way because Article II of the articles of war that were in force at the time were restricted to members of the United States military.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.450" offset="6465724">Article 15, which the Court relied on, didn't expressly authorize military commissions expressly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3181.549" offset="12726126">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.667" offset="12730619">And let me say that those are exactly the sort of individuals that the passage of 4001 was designed to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.571" offset="12758204">The Emergency Detention Act, which 4001 repealed, specifically talked about the possibility of saboteurs in this country who are under the direction and control of the communist empire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.046" offset="12804180">And so there was a specific concern with individuals who might be under that kind of power in 4001.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.866" offset="12827376">And Congress wanted to make very clear that such individuals could not simply be detained at executive discretion, but could only be detained pursuant to positive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.806" offset="12863216">Positive law that is simply nonexistent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.174" offset="12876696">The type of association with a terrorist organization is also unclear based on the Government's allegations in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.446" offset="12917760">Surely the Government cannot claim that anyone who associated with any member of Al Qaeda at any time would be subject to indefinite military detention without trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.802" offset="12955167">Mr. Padilla's mother, because she is associated with her son, may be argued to have associated with Al Qaeda, and clearly that's not what Congress had in mind, to allow that person to be locked up with no right to a lawyer, no right to a hearing for as long as the war on terror lasts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.145" offset="13016503">That's simply not consistent with our nation's constitutional traditions, it's a limitless power and there is no call for it in this case.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3263.850" stopTime="3269.487">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3263.850" offset="13055373">So you say that Judge Mukasey's solution for this case was not adequate, then?</text>

            <text syncTime="3269.487" offset="13077943">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.054" offset="13084212">We do not believe that Judge Mukasey's solution was adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.391" offset="13097482">We believe that in the first sentence, clear authorization and parameters for such detention must come from Congress, defining who ought to be detained and what procedures ought to accompany those detentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.764" offset="13143040">And at that point, this Court could review them for consistency with the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.751" offset="13158922">But no, while certainly Judge Mukasey's order was better than what the Government offered, which was no process at all, no opportunity to be heard and no access to counsel, certainly Judge Mukasey's order was better than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.792" offset="13211167">But when the indefinite deprivation of a citizen's liberty is at stake, we would argue that the Government must come forward with more than some evidence consisting of any evidence in the record that might support the Government's position that he's associated with terrorists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.152" offset="13272607">When this type of extreme deprivation of liberty is at issue, something more than that is required by the Due Process Clause and by our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.758" offset="13306984">So certainly what we would say is that this Court needs not to decide those issues today, of what precise standard of proof ought to be given, exactly when an individual ought to be allowed access to counsel and what the limits are on how long such an individual could be held, et cetera, because those are primarily questions for Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.623" offset="13394442">And this Court ought to wait until Congress has come in and provided that kind of guidance before it passes on these grave constitutional questions, which really go to the core of what our democracy is about, which is that the Government cannot take citizens in this country off the street and lock them up in jail forever without a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.853" offset="13475318">That's never the way our country has operated and it's fundamentally inconsistent with our traditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.924" offset="13499664">And so I would submit today is not the day for this Court to decide whether that's permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.660" offset="13522547">The Government asks in this case for basically limitless power and however grave the circumstances of the war on terror may be, this nation has faced other grave threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.033" offset="13568104">We've had war on our soil before and never before in our nation's history has this Court granted the President a blank check to do whatever he wants to American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.424" offset="13613662">So the fact that we're at war does not mean that our normal constitutional rules do not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.395" offset="13633515">Even in wartime, especially in wartime, the Founders wanted to place limits on the ability of the executive to deprive citizens of liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.184" offset="13672699">And they were concerned, based on the history of the British Crown, of the possibility that an unchecked executive using excuses based on national security, using the military power to render that superior to civilian authorities, could exercise the exact type of power that's at issue in this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul D. Clement</label>
            <text syncTime="3443.085" offset="13772278">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.251" offset="13780950">I would like to make just three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.120" offset="13788473">First, on jurisdiction, it is true that the immediate custodian rule is not a hard and fast rule and it has been... exceptions have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.459" offset="13821806">But the territorial jurisdiction rule, as statutorily prescribed, limits the Court's jurisdiction and is a hard and fast rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.564" offset="13854198">And the best evidence of the relationship between the two is in those cases where you had to relax one or the other, when you had a citizen detained abroad where the immediate custodian was abroad outside the territorial jurisdiction of any district court, rather than relax the rule of territorial jurisdiction, the Court said you could sue the Secretary of Defense in a district where there is territorial jurisdiction over the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.180" offset="13948656">It is true there are situations like Strait against Laird that don't involve normal physical confinement, where the Court has had to come up with some rule to deal with the fact that you only have a metaphysical custodian.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.822" offset="13995259">But in the case of a physical detention of an individual, the Court has never relaxed the rule that you file it in the district where the immediate custodian is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.093" offset="14032353">And if you look at this Court's decision in Carbo and Justice Rutledge's dissent in Ahrens, you'll see that if you don't respect the rule in a situation like this, there is nothing left to the statutory language and nothing left of the intent of the Congress that passed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.501" offset="14085956">The second point I would like to make is that in looking at this case and the authority that's asserted and the role of 4001(a), it's important to recognize that there is a significant difference between civilian authority and the military authority over enemy combatants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.613" offset="14150426">This Court, when it decided Endo and addressed the situation of the detention of the Japanese, specifically carved out the situation of the military detention of enemy combatants and said that that is not involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.504" offset="14206015">It stands to reason that if Congress, in passing 4001(a) to effectively prevent another Japanese internment camp of concededly loyal citizens also probably wanted to put to one side the issue of military detention of enemy combatants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.732" offset="14270903">In any event, the Court need not ultimately decide whether 4001(a) has any application because the authorization of force clearly provides the necessary act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.838" offset="14311340">It authorizes not Article III courts for these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.226" offset="14324820">It authorizes military force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.642" offset="14334537">And the relevant line here is provided this Court's case in Quirin, when somebody goes abroad, associates with the enemy, takes weapons training or explosives training with the enemy, and then returns to the United States with the intent to commit hostile and warlike acts at the direction of the enemy, that classically falls within the Quirin side of the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.091" offset="14420323">It's much different than a Landon Milligan who never left the State of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.043" offset="14436101">And the military has authority over that individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.595" offset="14450312">Lastly, let me just address the argument that somehow you can constrain the authorization of force and read it only to apply in a battlefield setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.617" offset="14486465">With respect, I think that ignores the context in which it was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.920" offset="14503602">It was passed seven days after September 11th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.956" offset="14515722">The resolution itself recognizes that we face continuing threats at home and abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.610" offset="14538397">It was not passed as a matter of retribution for those attacks, but to prevent future attacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.995" offset="14559922">To read it to deny the Government the authority to detain a latter day citizen version of Mohammed Atta is to simply ignore the will of Congress.</text>
