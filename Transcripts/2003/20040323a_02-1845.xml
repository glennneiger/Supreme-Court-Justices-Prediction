            <text syncTime="61.384" offset="245447">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="64.066" offset="256209">The issue in these consolidated cases is whether participants and beneficiaries of ERISA plans may seek consequential and punitive damages in state court under state tort law for the allegedly wrongful denial of ERISA health care benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.324" offset="325277">The Fifth Circuit answered that question yes, reasoning that completely... that the complete preemption under the Federal statute applies to contract claims that essentially duplicate what's available under Section 502 of the Federal statute, but not to tort claims, which give supplemental remedy for consequential and punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.018" offset="420049">For two principal reasons, the judgment of the Fifth Circuit should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.334" offset="445336">First, this Court has consistently held that all challenges to the propriety of benefit determination, whether couched in tort or in contract, are completely preempted by Section 502 and therefore are removable and governed solely by Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.257" offset="512940">Second, the fact that the welfare plans at issue in these cases provide benefits for medical care, as opposed to disability, death, or some other welfare benefit, does not alter the analysis under the Federal statute or give the states any more power to supplement the remedies that Congress included in Section 502.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="176.932" offset="707709">Mr. Estrada, can I just raise a question?</text>
            <text syncTime="179.078" offset="716278">I'm sure you'll cover it in the argument and I want to get it on the table.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.929" offset="727667">On your first point, that our prior cases have said that 502 is the exclusive remedy for actions to acquire benefits, is there a distinction?</text>
            <text syncTime="192.165" offset="768627">Some of your opponents argued between denials based on the terms of the plan, that this just doesn't qualify for some reason, on the one hand, that you just should get the answer out of the plan, and denials based on a discretionary decision as to whether the medical treatment was appropriate or not, which would require the exercise of some kind of professional judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.227" offset="848875">The nurse might think he doesn't need an extra day in the hospital or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.653" offset="862563">Is that a valid distinction or not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="217.716" stopTime="281.679">
            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="217.716" offset="870818">--No.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.254" offset="873012">And let me turn to that... that was my second point, but I'll turn to it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.903" offset="887536">The use of medical criteria, whether discretionary or not, is inherent in health care coverage and usually is also inherent in... in disability coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.072" offset="940199">Yet, last Term, in the Black &amp; Decker case, this Court held that the... that a claimant's treating doctor gets no special deference in a claim for the benefits where the issue is whether the medical factors warrant a disability finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.850" offset="999340">Under the theory being advanced by Texas and the respondents in this case, however, Black &amp; Decker needn't, and maybe even couldn't, be an ERISA case because a state of the union could regulate the medical component of the disability finding under the guise of regulating the practice of medicine and could give tort remedies and consequential and punitive damages whenever the plan disagreed with the... with the claimant's doctor.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="281.679" stopTime="295.835">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="281.679" offset="1126713">Yes, of course they could, but the fact that if we held there was no preemption, it wouldn't necessarily mean they would win on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.488" offset="1153881">I mean, you are... your drug formulary may be absolutely defensible, even though it could be tested in a state court proceeding.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="295.835" stopTime="327.786">
            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="295.835" offset="1183242">Well, I didn't understand the claim as to the Aetna case necessarily to be a challenge to the promulgation of the formulary, which is expressly authorized by the prescription drug writer of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.717" offset="1234860">I understood the challenge to be to a particular benefits decision that was made when Aetna, the insurer and plan administrator, concluded that the benefit was not covered in the circumstances because of the step therapy requirement.</text>

          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="327.786" stopTime="363.702">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="327.786" offset="1311138">I don't want you to go too long on point two without getting back to point one, but as long as we're here, it does seem to me that the dichotomy, the duality you propose between a decision about benefits and medical treatment might, at the edges, blur into each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.727" offset="1390864">If I say, as Aetna or CIGNA, you're not authorized to seek this treatment and the person has no other funds, basically, that is a treatment decision, in a sense.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="363.702" stopTime="437.141">
            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="363.702" offset="1454707">No, it is not, Justice Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.560" offset="1462230">The purpose of employee benefits plan... benefit plans is to cover some things for the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.990" offset="1491905">If the plans in these cases said that the benefit was $100 for each hospital stay or that you got $20 for your drugs, whatever they may be, no one would deny that that was a... that that was a benefit determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.472" offset="1553868">As I said earlier, with respect to medical care, it has always been the case that in determining the scope of coverage, medical factors have always been used and that factor is imbedded into the background understandings of how this very statute works.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.941" offset="1619696">For example, Section 503 of the statute allows the Department of Labor to promulgate regulations to deal with how claims are made and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.676" offset="1662642">One of those regulations by... by the Department of Labor expressly contemplates that if a claimant has a proposed treatment turned down, he may appeal to a named fiduciary who is required, under the DOL regs, to consult with an... with an appropriate medical hair... care professional and--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="437.141" stopTime="448.120">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="437.141" offset="1748532">I guess my point was, at some time, and even in these cases, there... that there was a component of what we might call medical judgment involved.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="miguel_a_estrada" startTime="448.120" stopTime="529.899">
            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="448.120" offset="1792418">--That is undisputed, Justice Kennedy, and I think that our position is that there is a fundamental difference between a claimant who has a doctor patient relationship with his doctor and a claimant who had an insuretal coverage relation with his insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.269" offset="1853022">Just to put it into context of legal practice, if the person reading the plan documents and denying a claim... the claim, excuse me, uses medical training to conclude that the plan documents did not cover a treatment, I think few people would think that that entitled the claimant to sue the person who turned it down for legal malpractice.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.955" offset="1951765">And the same is basically true here, too, because the plan's... the plan's role, as is very clear in the express, for example, in the... in the text of the Monitronics opinion, is to deal with the question, shall we pay or shall we not pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.365" offset="2025430">And that's actually precisely what Texas has targeted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.931" offset="2051657">If I could direct the Court's attention to the petition appendix in the Aetna case, 02-1885, the relevant parts of the Texas statute are set forth in page 59a and--</text>

            <text syncTime="552.373" offset="2209437">It is an affirmative defense under the Texas statute that the managed care entity did not deny or delay payment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1596.522" offset="6385998">And this Court decided, in Pilot Life and in Metropolitan Life against Taylor, and it reaffirmed two terms ago in the Rush Prudential case, that those questions are ERISA questions and Congress decided that... set in place a set of remedies that allow for very substantial rights to determine whether you're entitled to the benefit, but limited your rights to sue for pun... for compensatory and especially punitive damages afterwards, because there's also, on the other side of the balance, the need to encourage employers to provide healthcare and to create ERISA plans.</text>

Maybe it should be A, B, C, and D, and so what the state's trying to do here, is add D.</text>

            <text syncTime="2866.332" offset="11465247">The Texas legislature has imposed a duty of ordinary care on managed care entities that insert themselves into health care treatment decisions by exercising medical judgment to decide medical necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.170" offset="11516656">It is important to recognize at the outset as this court recognized the managed care entity is not the ERISA plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.047" offset="11552183">Our statute does not impose liability on the ERISA plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.710" offset="11570782">Our statute does not impose liability on an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.714" offset="11586769">As Mr. Estrada said in his argument, the whole point of the complete preemption and the exclusive remedies provision Section 502(a), is insuring employers that will have limited liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.157" offset="11636611">Our statute explicitly excludes employers from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.275" offset="11657091">And therefore the concerns of Section 502(a) are not at play in the Texas statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.606" offset="11686348">The reason the Texas statute was passed was because managed care entities, HMOs and other varieties and forms, had decided to exercise medical judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.001" offset="11731905">And it is that duty that the state is regulating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.345" offset="11745280">Which is what I think distinguishes this case from Pilot Life.</text>

            <text syncTime="2968.378" offset="11873489">And in that case the Court recognized that the tort claim that was being alleged was derived from the general proposition to perform contracts in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.863" offset="11915389">And the duty that the Court was looking at in Allis-Chalmers, and also Pilot Life, was the duty to enforce the contract that was the ERISA plan therefore implicating complete preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.093" offset="11960320">However the Court explicitly said in Allis-Chalmers, that Congress did not intend to give the substance of provisions the force of Federal law, ousting any inconsistent state regulations, because such a rule would allow labor unions, and unionized employees the power to exempt themselves from whatever state labor standards they disfavored.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.672" offset="12050599">And again the Texas statute is not imposing any duty on the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="3031.498" offset="12125936">The revision in the act is setup such that if a managed care entity were to come in and say well I did not exercise any medical judgment, or I did not make any decisions that affected the treatment, they could come in as a defense and say, the reason I did not make any medical judgment was because the plan did not allow me to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.675" offset="12210678">The plan simply excluded that completely in a pure eligibility decision in the court's words in Pegram.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.461" offset="12909819">Utilization, review techniques are designed to ensure that quality care is delivered as cost efficiently as possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="3249.009" offset="12996023">What the Court needs to recognize if I may, is that prior to the rise of managed care, decisions were made on a retrospective basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.471" offset="13029878">An insurer would say, well we've looked at this, we do not believe it was medically necessary, we're not going to pay for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3385.119" offset="13540415">Let's imagine a plan with millions of different benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.463" offset="13553789">Whenever a benefit is turned down, there will always be a human being who told the plan manager it isn't called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.932" offset="13583673">Now a state could come in and regulate their human being, those human beings in their capacity as professionals and say whenever they make such a mistake, they've made a professional misjudgment and we give you an extra remedy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.306" offset="13637172">And that seems to be the thing that this statute forbids.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.559" offset="13654204">I don't see how to get around it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3419.420" offset="13677610">And I believe the answer to that question is what the statute is concerned about is limiting and defining the liability of employers and plan sponsors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.247" offset="13716898">And a statute that regulates the conduct of a third party who sells their services to that plan or plan sponsor, has no impact on the liability of that plan or that plan sponsor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.243" offset="13772904">And in this particular case, in Texas we have made a determination that with managed care entities as an entity, be it an HMO, be it a PPO, exercising medical judgment, we are regulating the medical judgment of that third party.</text>

            <text syncTime="3473.381" offset="13893486">Number one, is it true that the people who make the decisions for your client must be medical doctors in Texas?</text>

            <text syncTime="3513.605" offset="14054400">Because in each of those cases, you were dealing with an insurance company that was acting as a claim administrator or insurer with respect to an ERISA plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.884" offset="14087523">And if memory serves, the claim was made as well in Pegram, and the Court dealt with at the top of page 223 of 530 U.S., by pointing out that a contract between an HMO and the plan may itself contain elements of a plan to the extent that it governs the circumstances under which benefits may be obtained.</text>

            <text syncTime="3556.973" offset="14227853">No and in fact it is also not true in this case that that's so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.522" offset="14242064">Because you have been citing subsection (c)(2) of the statute, here under Section (d) it is affirmatively stated that nothing in the act shall be construed to provide... to require the provision of something that is not covered and that is at page... also 59 (a) of the AETNA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.949" offset="14327745">Just let me take one second to make two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.497" offset="14341956">It is of course open to Texas to have a law that regulates the practice of medicine, by telling hospitals do not discharge somebody who needs care.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.330" offset="14377273">And there is nothing in the Federal statute that would keep them from doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.211" offset="14392842">In fact we have a Federal statute in PAPA that does something similar with respect to hospitals that take in medicare money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.197" offset="14424712">With respect to how quickly we could do these things Justice Stevens, the DOL regulations say that consistent with the urgency of the situation it must be done as soon as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.243" offset="14468911">It can be done informally and the doctor may act for the patient to pursue all of the plan appeals and that is at pages 17(a) and 3(a) of the Appendix to the blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.419" offset="14517603">Brief word about the insurance savings clause, I will not belabor it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.499" offset="14537979">There is a footnote in one of the briefs in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.744" offset="14546965">It doesn't raise the clause as opposed to the section 502 issue, but the acid test is that there was no mention of the clause, in the brief in opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.477" offset="14581864">Under this Court's rules and Oklahoma City versus Tuttle that is completely reclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.731" offset="14598896">Should we need to reach it I will point out that one of the response... the petitioners in this case is a self funded plan, in the CIGNA case, which would be saved by the Deemer clause even if the insurance clause did apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.342" offset="14657306">And that is to both of them, the question whether the insurance savings clause does apply was conclusively resolved by Pilot Life, has never been revisited by the Court, and that Pilot Life--</text>
