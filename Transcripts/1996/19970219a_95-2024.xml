            <text syncTime="2917.298" offset="11812485">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.995" offset="11867342">Our position is that the settlement plan is constitutional, and that the district court did not violate any principles of Federalism in approving it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.362" offset="11904749">On the constitutional question, I wanted to make three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.275" offset="11920423">The first is that the district court applied the correct legal standard in judging the constitutionality of the proposed plan, that it correctly drew from Miller the principle that a plan is subject to strict scrutiny only when a challenger can show that race predominated in the design of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.646" offset="11989909">The second point I wanted to make is that district court findings of predominant motive are governed by the clearly erroneous standard of review, so that the district court's finding in this case that District 21 was not predominantly motivated by racial considerations is subject to review in this Court only for clear error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.860" offset="12070784">The final point I wanted to make on the constitutional question is that the district court's subsidiary findings show that its ultimate finding on predominant motive is not clearly erroneous, and those findings are that the district is sufficiently regular by Florida standards to avoid any suggestion that race predominated, that the district includes a genuine community of interest, and that the district affords to any candidate, without regard to race, the opportunity to be elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.989" offset="12183319">Now, those findings are all supported by the record and are together sufficient to support the district court's ultimate finding that race did not predominate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.326" offset="12216651">On the Federalism question, we think it was entirely appropriate for the district court to resolve the litigation without making a formal adjudication based on the State's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.024" offset="12263463">It would... it is one of the principle reasons that parties enter into settlements, is to avoid a formal adjudication, to avoid findings of liability.</text>
