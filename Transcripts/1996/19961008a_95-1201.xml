            <text syncTime="1718.106" offset="7017284">The nature of this case, as Justice Souter has suggested, is a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.113" offset="7053333">It's called a coverage case under section 5, and the only inquiry in these cases is whether there is a covered jurisdiction, if so, whether that jurisdiction is enacting or seeking to administer a new change which it has initiated affecting voting rights, and then the third question is, did they first obtain the requisite preclearance?</text>

            <text syncTime="3429.928" offset="13864501">And with respect to the remedy we are urging this Court to reverse the district court's use of the unprecleared election change, and so that the court can then conduct whatever evidentiary hearing needs to be conducted in order to determine what should be the appropriate remedy, and the reason why we have to go beyond the injunction is because there has been... we have to correct the previous effects of elections that were conducted under an unprecleared election system, and that was what the temporary plan did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.747" offset="13983828">We have election systems since 1968, up to the time that the complaint was filed, conducted under an unprecleared election system.</text>
