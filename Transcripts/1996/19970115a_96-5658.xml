            <text syncTime="42.327" offset="305120">Another way of appraising it is the way we phrased it in the Butler case, isn't it, Mr. Lawry, that could a reasonable jurist have decided otherwise?</text>

            <text syncTime="54.301" offset="352977">That the Espinosa result was compelled in 1986 can be explained very briefly, in 30 seconds or less.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.539" offset="385996">As Stringer explains, as of 1985 an unadorned jury instruction on heinous, atrocious or cruel aggravating factor was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.798" offset="435001">An uncorrected jury weighing of such a factor required resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.785" offset="458929">Moreover, jury weighing of such a factor could be corrected or cured only by harmless error analysis or by independent reweighing by a court that was untainted by the original error.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.510" offset="509816">Espinosa simply applied those settled principles to the Florida sentencing scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.247" offset="536774">To elaborate somewhat on these points, I would like to describe in a bit more detail why the result in Espinosa was compelled by this Court's decisions in Proffitt, Godfrey, and Stringer.</text>

            <text syncTime="127.063" offset="644085">--that there was a question about just how intense the reweighing had to be if that were to supersede a jury error, and I would have supposed that that would be factored into the question of just how clearly anticipatable Espinosa was.</text>

            <text syncTime="148.343" offset="729140">Yes, sir, I think it does factor in, if I can explain the way that I think it factors in.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.380" offset="749307">We have to start with Proffitt v. Florida in 1976, and in fact respondent has quoted one of the key passages from Proffitt in their brief at page 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.557" offset="810015">The Court was discussing whether the Florida sentencing scheme was basically constitutional, and it said that it was basically constitutional as long as adequate guidance was provided, and I'm quoting here, to those charged with the duty of recommending... that is, the jury... or imposing death sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.737" offset="894756">So in Proffitt this Court recognized that the jury has sentencing authority and must be adequately guided, and I would see Baldwin as more or less a reminder that the Florida sentencing scheme does work in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.515" offset="961839">It's different from Alabama, which at the time gave no real consideration to what the jury did.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="212.835" offset="987125">Well, that may... you know, that might be the better view, but isn't it also the case that one could reasonably read Baldwin as saying that it's not clear whether the subsequent act of the sentencing judge in the Florida scheme constituted an adequate reweighing even on the assumption... which, of course, we never really know under the Florida scheme... even on the assumption that that factor was found by the jury and was one of the bases for the jury's recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.419" offset="1101437">Couldn't it reasonably have been argued that Baldwin had left that question open?</text>

            <text syncTime="254.079" offset="1152115">But didn't Baldwin signal that there was a real issue to this effect, and that issue, at least so far as the particular Florida scheme was concerned, did not get resolved until... or at least resolved in part until Espinosa came along?</text>

            <text syncTime="286.217" offset="1280637">The way to decide the issue is to look at how the Florida sentencing scheme actually works, applying this Court's settled principles, and if you look at the way that the Florida sentencing scheme works, you have to start with the Florida supreme court's 1975 decision in Tedder, and respondent virtually ignores Tedder in their brief because that's the only way that you can really seriously argue that the Florida jury does not have any sentencing authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.736" offset="1398711">Proffitt says that the jury does have sentencing authority, that it has to be guided, and that's exactly what this Court picked up on in Espinosa.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="326.775" offset="1442910">But the question, it seems to me, that you've got to wrestle with here under Teague is whether, assuming we were correct, and I happen to think we were insofar as evaluating the significance of the jury's function, you still have to wrestle with the question whether the subsequent act of the judge, who is presumed to know the Proffitt standard, in effect adequately supersedes what the jury had done, and I would have thought that that was the difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.746" offset="1570805">And one reason why that was a question upon which people could reasonably disagree was that Baldwin had said we're not telling you yet just what kind of subsequent act or how intense or de novo a subsequent reweighing will be required, and I would have thought that was the sticking point under Teague.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.627" offset="1670280">Well, I think that Stringer answers the question about what significance the trial court's actions have.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.833" offset="1715106">Stringer says that as of 1985, in order to cure weighing error before a jury, it's necessary to either have harmless error review or independent reweighing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1564.681" offset="6394472">The district court... as to the Godfrey claim that had been raised back in the district court, the State argued at that time that there was a procedural bar based on several different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.004" offset="6443791">One of the reasons, and this is in the joint appendix on pages 46 to 49 in the State's response, the primary reason was this was a direct appeal issue in the State of Florida, and it had not been raised in Mr. Lambrix's direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.181" offset="6504500">The next... the other argument put forth by the State at that time was that although it had been raised in the motion for post conviction relief, the trial judge in that motion did not decide the merits of that issue, and furthermore, when it went to the Florida supreme court, the Florida supreme court did not have that particular issue before it, because the Florida supreme court opinion from the appeal of the post conviction motion clearly says there are two issues before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.849" offset="6727168">Based on Florida procedure is how the district court reached that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.652" offset="6750365">What happened is, the Godfrey claim that was raised in post conviction... and this was a claim that the Florida supreme court had inconsistently interpreted this aggravating factor, and therefore the factor was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.460" offset="6797594">That claim was raised in the post conviction motion for the first time, and the State responded at that time that it was a direct appeal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.864" offset="6827269">The circuit court judge, the trial judge in Florida, did not specifically address that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.600" offset="6854227">In his order he merely concluded that Mr. Lambrix was not entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.171" offset="6872513">He does not say, based on the merits, or based on the procedural law in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.539" offset="6889963">He just says his conclusion is Mr. Lambrix is not entitled to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.710" offset="6906681">That is what the Federal district judge in the habeas proceeding found to be a ruling on the merits, his conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.531" offset="6937924">When that was appealed to the Florida supreme court, there is a particular statute... I'm sorry, a rule of procedure in Florida that when a post conviction motion is determined summarily by a trial judge without an evidentiary hearing, that what is... goes to the Florida supreme court or whatever the appellate court is, is simply the record that was before the lower court, and that there is no briefing or argument in that appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.681" offset="7042518">It's basically a review of what the trial judge had before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.402" offset="7057356">If there is an evidentiary hearing held on the post conviction motion, it is treated as an ordinary appeal where the parties file briefs and orally argue the case, and then the court decides it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.774" offset="7098943">Because there had been no evidentiary hearing on the post conviction motion, the petitioner has argued to the Federal district court successfully that under the Florida rule that says everything goes up to the Florida supreme court, even though in this particular case there were briefs filed and there was oral argument held, that under the rule, you have to look at the entire record and not just what was argued in the briefs and argued to the court, and that's what the district court found when he found that there was a ruling on the merits by the trial judge, and that that ruling on the merits was undisturbed by the Florida supreme court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.764" offset="7242825">Therefore, he found that it was reviewed, and central to his holding... of course, this is prior to the time that the Espinosa claim went back and was found to be procedurally barred by the Florida supreme court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.870" offset="7283263">Central to the district court was the idea that no State court had ever specifically said this is procedurally barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.607" offset="7310221">He was looking for that language in one of the State court opinions and he did not find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.309" offset="7329029">Based on the lack of that statement, he said that there was a ruling on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.463" offset="7349614">So the State has maintained consistently that this was a direct appeal issue that should have been raised in the direct appeal and it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.700" offset="7378557">This same issue in the Sochar case, this Court declined to address it, because it was procedurally barred in that case, and that was a direct review case, so you really can't come back on a collateral case on habeas review and address the procedurally barred issue that's the same issue that you didn't address earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="2908.430" offset="11769532">I think you need to read the Florida supreme court decisions that interpret Tedder and that say what they meant by Tedder, and the Florida supreme court has expressly come out and said in Tedder we did not elevate the jury to be a cosentencer in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.071" offset="11824076">That was never our intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.623" offset="11830240">The judge has a statutory duty to do an independent, de novo review of the aggravating and the mitigating factors, and the jury recommendation is just that, an advisory recommendation, and the Florida supreme court said that quite strongly in cases where the Eleventh Circuit had found a Caldwell error, a violation that the jury's role was minimized to the jury based on Florida's standard jury instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.138" offset="11924386">For those reasons, we would ask you to affirm the Eleventh Circuit's opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2965.766" offset="11998887">There's two important points about what happened in the trial court in the 3850 proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.337" offset="12025114">The claim that was raised there was a Maynard claim that challenged the vagueness of the jury instructions as well as the Florida supreme court's review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.775" offset="12058864">Furthermore, the trial court denied the State's motion to dismiss, which was based on procedural grounds, so the clear implication of what the trial court did is that it was ruling on the merits of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.333" offset="12109124">If there's no further questions, I have nothing additional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2999.237" offset="12132738">Well, but the procedural bar is not just failure to raise it at the trial level, is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.724" offset="12154681">It's failure to bring it to the attention of the supreme court, which brings us back to our earlier discussion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3010.712" offset="12178609">Right, but when a State court rules on the merits... the 3850 proceedings are after the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.966" offset="12211628">When a State court rules on the merits in any proceeding, that does away with the procedural bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="3056.638" offset="12362303">That is, is the role of judge-jury there really like a judge-jury in a negligence case or some other, or does the judge really make a pretty independent decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.744" offset="12398769">Now, what do you think we ought to read on that, just Tedder?</text>

            <text syncTime="3068.196" offset="12408591">Well, I would read Sochar and the cases cited in Sochar, because there are numerous kinds of jury error that the Florida supreme court has reviewed in death penalty cases... jury instruction error, improper evidence, improper argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.872" offset="12471285">In none of those cases has the court said, oh, well, the jury has... there was error in front of the jury, but the judge did it, okay, so we don't have to concern ourselves with the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.263" offset="12512872">They've always said, look to see whether the error affected the jury, and that's exactly what should be done in this case, and that shows that it's not just a pure judge case--</text>

            <text syncTime="3105.405" offset="12557385">Mr. Lawry, can I come back to your response to Justice O'Connor?</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.440" offset="12569506">You say it's... the question of whether there's a procedural bar is a question of State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.391" offset="12589359">If it was a question of State law we have the last word of the supreme court of Florida, which says that this claim is procedurally barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.830" offset="12619138">Now, it seems to me that there is an issue whether that assertion by the Florida supreme court is sufficient to establish a procedural bar for Federal purposes, given that a lower Florida court had reached the merits in this other fashion and so forth, but it's clear, is it not, that the Florida supreme court believes this claim to be procedurally barred, as a matter of Florida law?</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.259" offset="12708791">Now, you know, they may be wrong as to whether they are... that is good enough to create a Federal bar, but don't we have the word of the Florida supreme court?</text>
