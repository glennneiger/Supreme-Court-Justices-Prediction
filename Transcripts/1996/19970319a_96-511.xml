            <text syncTime="2225.510" offset="9056778">And maybe the people who are in the news group would come to see it, maybe not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3830.695" offset="15477467">And to answer Justice Breyer's question about telephone, I do not believe it is a crime in this country today for private persons, including private teenagers, to communicate indecent speech by telephone.</text>
