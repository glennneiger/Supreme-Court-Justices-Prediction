            <text syncTime="15.701" offset="202350">Petitioner Joyce Johnson was tried and convicted on a single count of perjury, in violation of 18 United States Code 1623.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.378" offset="241012">Her conviction occurred 6 months prior to this Court's holding in Gaudin.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.064" offset="263790">Her trial was conducted in total reliance on the then-existing and long-standing precedent of the Eleventh Circuit, which for more than 50 years had removed the element of materiality from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.083" offset="335784">That precedent further provided that the judge would instruct the jury that the element of materiality had been found in favor of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.741" offset="378416">Trial counsel's entire preparation, strategy, and performance in the trial was dictated by this now-overruled precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.079" offset="423764">This reliance on the wrong precedent from beginning to end of the proceedings caused an infection of the proceedings and rendered them totally different than what our Constitution requires.</text>

            <text syncTime="109.194" offset="576319">The element has to be proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.425" offset="585201">What was different about the proof that was presented of the materiality here from what it would have been if the trier had been a jury rather than a judge?</text>

            <label>Mr. William J. Sheppard</label>
            <text syncTime="122.792" offset="630654">Justice Ginsburg, we agree that the element was there and the Government had the duty to prove it, albeit a footnote under Eleventh Circuit precedent was questionable as to what the standard of proof was, but I submit that when a lawyer gets a case, what he does, he looks to see what are the elements of the case, and I think that's the first thing that a lawyer does.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.188" offset="728248">He pulls the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.490" offset="733472">He then goes to the standard jury instructions, and what happened here was that counsel had to persuade a judge, and was... his opportunity to persuade a jury was taken away, and I submit that cases are tried based on elements starting from beginning to end, with the questions that you prepare to submit to a district judge to ask in voir dire, when we get up and make opening statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.608" offset="841932">Inevitably, those opening statements focus on elements.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.259" offset="912568">Ms. Johnson in her grand jury testimony was never asked directly, did you receive the money that went into the renovation of your home from the target of this grand jury investigation, or we assume it is, Mr. Fields?</text>
            <text syncTime="207.509" offset="969514">She told the grand jury that she got money for the renovation of her home from her mama, when indeed she was never asked directly did it come from Fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.145" offset="1016117">Well, if it came from a third source... suppose she'd robbed a bank and put the money in.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.089" offset="1039836">It would not have been material as to any investigation of Mr. Fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.473" offset="1057390">Secondly, I believe that the cross-examination of the jury foreman, and even more specifically of Special Agent William Stull of the FBI, who testified that the... about what the grand jury was investigating, that cross-examination was severely limited because counsel knew that 50 years of precedent in his circuit and 70 years of precedent in all of the circuits as it relates to a perjury prosecution, that that element was taken away from him.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.817" offset="1206811">No reasonable juror could conclude that Johnson's false statements about the source of the money were not material.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.183" offset="1248189">However, they aren't the individuals that our history and the precedent of this Court says ought to be answering those kinds of questions, and as this Court unanimously held in Gaudin, and respectfully, the Eleventh Circuit is just squarely wrong when they say that the right to a jury trial, which is the first codified law in this Nation, isn't a substantial right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1502.988" offset="6151477">I'd first like to address why the plain error rule applies in this case, and then turn to the question of why petitioner is not entitled to relief under the plain error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.163" offset="6196199">Now, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure impose a contemporaneous objection requirement on any party that wishes to assign an error either to the trial court or on appeal, and those provisions are set forth in our brief at the appendix, page 3a.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.177" offset="6276238">The first rule is Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 30, which states that no party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission there from unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.937" offset="6335274">Rule 51 amplifies that requirement by stating that exceptions are not necessary, but that it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or the order of the court is made, makes known to the court the action which this party... which that party desires the court to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.980" offset="6411448">Petitioner did not comply with those two provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.773" offset="6430569">She did not object to the court's instruction on materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.187" offset="6448228">Indeed, she had sought it, and she did not make the argument, which was being widely made by defendants around the country at the time of this trial, that materiality should be decided by the jury rather than the judge, and as a result of failing to comply with the contemporaneous objection requirement for these two rules, the source for reviewing any claim of error that she now wishes to make is Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2209.101" offset="8975941">The first is that the plain error rule should be read to require that the error be plain both at the time of trial and at the time of appeal, not simply at the time of appeal.</text>

Circuit does read Rule 52 the same way that we do, and has required parties to raise... has said that if the claim is clear at the time of appeal it must also be clear at the time of trial in order to come within Rule 52, so the D.C. Circuit agrees with us on that point, but then the D.C.

            <text syncTime="3054.489" offset="12357439">That is frequently the case, because the issue of materiality is often proved up, as the Court well knows, by the testimony of the grand jury foreman who says, we were looking at drug-dealing and money-laundering by this person, and we therefore asked these questions to find out the answers to those things, and then the testimony was given, and now the jury is going to decide whether the testimony was true or false.</text>

            <text syncTime="3120.972" offset="12623366">--just treated it as a question that got decided beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.094" offset="12635905">What is clear from this trial judge's findings is that he reviewed the record, he understood what the focus of the grand jury investigation was, he understood why it was relevant to the grand jury to know the source of funds for a house that petitioner purchased potentially with laundered drug money from her boyfriend, said all of that on the record, and he then articulated the standard in what I think is the correct legal standard for materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.959" offset="12731304">He said, this may have been within the purview of what the grand jury was investigating, which I think was a loose fashion, per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.105" offset="12759934">This was reasonably calculated to affect the decision of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.687" offset="12778220">Petitioner, of course, never objected in the trial court and said, oh, no, you're applying the wrong standard of materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.671" offset="12802148">Nor did petitioner ever say you haven't found it to the requisite degree of proof, and I don't think that there's any real question that the trial judge was firmly convinced that this false testimony was material, as was the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.641" offset="12854079">So our final submission to this Court is that in a case like this the appropriate response is to apply the plain error rule because the objection was not preserved at trial, to treat the error as nonstructural in character, to examine what its actual impact was--</text>

            <label>Mr. William J. Sheppard</label>
            <text syncTime="3199.084" offset="12935790">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.724" offset="12942373">I think the language in Bollenbach v. United States and in Cabana v. Bullock... if I may refresh the Court: in other words the question is not whether guilt may be spelled out in the record, but whether guilt has been found by a jury according to the procedures and standards appropriate for criminal trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.980" offset="13031399">That was in Bollenbach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.392" offset="13037041">In Cabana, the language: findings made by a judge cannot cure deficiencies in the jury's findings as to the guilt or innocence of a defendant resulting from the court's failure to instruct it to find an element of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.231" offset="13088450">The entire rationale of the plain error rule is to prevent lawyers from sand-bagging.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.765" offset="13110602">Is it sand-bagging to follow a half-a-century of precedent?</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.036" offset="13123663">Certainly not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.497" offset="13133485">To follow the Government's argument here is going to cause lawyers, experienced lawyers to object to everything, and for the Solicitor to say that there was a lot of precedent out there going on in the country before this trial is flat wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.318" offset="13192731">If you read the Ninth Circuit opinion in Gaudin, you will find that's a 1001 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.412" offset="13217181">This Court characterized the Ninth Circuit as a maverick circuit on that issue and, finally in that regard, the Ninth Circuit case was a 1001 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.139" offset="13260022">This is a 1623 case, and at the time of this trial the precedent in the Ninth Circuit was that materiality on a perjury case was different than 1001, and that is not an argument that helps this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3294.747" offset="13318536">Mr. Sheppard, what do you say to the Government's argument that most circuits had adopted the rule that if you don't raise the objection you come within these provisions even if the objection would have been futile, and it hasn't produced, apparently, in those circuits the flood of futile objections that you contend will occur.</text>

            <text syncTime="3318.083" offset="13411846">Well, I would respectfully submit that in at least two circuits they've got stay orders on en banc cases awaiting the decision in this case, so I don't know that any lawyer knows what to do in those circuits yet, and I think this is an important case to signal to the trial bar what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.281" offset="13468584">As to the structural matter, I would ask the Court to harken to the language in Duncan v. Louisiana, which is the case that applied the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.622" offset="13521978">It is a structural guarantee that reflects a fundamental decision about the exercise of official power, a reluctance to entrust plenary powers over the life and liberty of the citizen to one judge or to a group of judges, and if you apply 52(b)... 52(a) here, that is indeed what you are doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.845" offset="13610899">You are pulling the rug out of the Sixth Amendment, and that is contrary to our history, and I think history... and we tried to set forth some history.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.132" offset="13652068">Mr. Sheppard, isn't it so that in the cases where there were complaints about a Sixth Amendment violation because women weren't being put on juries that the only defendants who got the benefit of that rule were the ones who had made a contemporaneous objection?</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.130" offset="13700029">I'm thinking particularly of Doran v. Missouri.</text>
