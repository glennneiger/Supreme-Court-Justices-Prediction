            <text syncTime="50.235" offset="340601">The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that this action by the Tribes with respect to quiet title claims was barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and nonetheless, the court proceeded to allow the suit with respect to the State officers to proceed under the rationale of Ex parte Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.276" offset="404758">Under the injunctive and declaratory relief sought by the Tribe, the Tribe would be awarded quiet title and exclusive possession of these lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="1398.287" offset="5732797">We are not seeking a determination as to whether Congress took affirmative action in this case to defeat the State's equal footing title.</text>

            <text syncTime="2883.449" offset="11673460">So, are we really in a position to accept your answer that what is being contested here are particular acts of regulation by particular State officers enforcing particular State laws?</text>

            <text syncTime="3152.477" offset="12749496">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.202" offset="12772379">One quick point with regard to the Eleventh Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.454" offset="12789411">I would like to go back to a question, two questions that were posed by this panel to Mr. Givens, one by Justice O'Connor, and one by Justice Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.950" offset="12823370">As Justice Ginsburg rightly points out, what the Tribe seeks, and it's stated in their response brief on page 4, what remains in the suit is declaratory and injunctive relief against Idaho officers to stop their violation of Federal law and to quiet the title, the Tribe's title against the world other than Idaho and its departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.542" offset="12893796">And as Justice O'Connor rightly observed, the essence of title to property is the opportunity to possess that property, and that's particularly true with respect to sovereign submerged lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.660" offset="12942279">As this Court said in Oregon v. Corvallis Sand &amp; Gravel, submerged lands cannot be compared to substantive property law, but rather as an issue substantially related to constitutional sovereignty of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.446" offset="12981358">The unique aspect of that sovereign title... there is a legal title and a public title... is the responsibility of the State to manage those lands for the benefit of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.651" offset="13014168">If the officers are enjoined from carrying out that sovereign duty, how can it be said that the sovereignty of the State is not affected?</text>

            <text syncTime="3225.026" offset="13039768">And what's the answer on that point, on that very point in Tindal?</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.079" offset="13059935">I thought they got that from the last paragraph of Tindal, so what is the answer to that?</text>

            <text syncTime="3235.382" offset="13081146">Where the Court... this Court seemed to divide all the aspects of title... I mean, with the fiction of the title itself, and says the State gets another chance to litigate it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3243.236" offset="13112598">--Tindal is a much different case than the case we have before us, because in Tindal it was an issue where the officers through their actions came into possession of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.253" offset="13144676">These officers have no relationship to the title here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.484" offset="13153558">The title passed to the State on Statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.664" offset="13162230">We've possessed it since that date, and so the officer's duties, what they're doing, have no relationship to title whatsoever, and so the only way you could bring in Tindal is to say that the officers are taking the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.561" offset="13205907">How can it be said that they're taking the property if they have never, by their own actions, took possession of the land, but rather, came into possession as a result of the constitutional presumption?</text>

            <text syncTime="3300.694" offset="13342371">And there's nothing to indicate why the United States... in this record why the United States sued for less than what the Tribe is claiming in this--</text>

            <text syncTime="3309.010" offset="13375703">No, Your Honor, but the reasonable assumption is that the United States has evaluated that claim and determined that there isn't a Federal interest in the northern two-thirds of the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.983" offset="13399527">Turning to the last or second question we presented to the Court, as Mr. Givens rightly points, that his theory is based upon the idea that Midwest Oil somehow gave the President authority by acquiescence of Congress, and it's our position that the Property Clause powers are vested exclusively within Congress, and then in the Sioux Tribe the only way that authority can be delegated to the President is by an express action of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.103" offset="13512062">This is particularly true with regard to the submerged lands, which are held in trust for the future States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.867" offset="13535050">If a President can simply unilaterally take those lands out of trust, then what aspect of sovereignty is really being protected?</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.541" offset="13557829">In fact, the sovereignty of States, they would have no way of protecting themselves against such a withdrawal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.554" offset="13581861">Moreover, Midwest Oil is a very unique case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.497" offset="13593564">It's limited to the situation in which the President is withdrawing lands, public lands that are available for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.600" offset="13618015">In Midwest Oil, the Court found acquiescence to be acceptable, because in that instance no third party was being injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.524" offset="13641734">The State of Idaho is being injured by this action because the lands were held in trust for the benefit of the State, and if they're taken out of trust and conveyed to the Tribe, then the State's sovereignty has been injured.</text>
