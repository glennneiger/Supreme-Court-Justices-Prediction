            <text syncTime="16.234" offset="207769">Throughout the decades, the States have developed three basic ways to deal with persons who commit sex crimes: criminal punishment, treatment in lieu of sentencing, and the law that you have before you today, Kansas's Sexually Violent Predator law, which is a hybrid of both.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.846" offset="274225">Leroy Hendricks has experienced all three during his 40-year history of sexually molesting children.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.620" offset="301288">It was the goal of the Kansas legislature by providing for treatment subsequent to punishment that we could succeed where the other procedures have failed, enabling Kansas to reduce the risk that Leroy Hendricks poses to our children.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.591" offset="361160">The civil commitment of sex offenders who suffer from a mental condition linked to their sex crimes has been approved by this Court on two prior occasions, by Pearson in 1940 and Allen in 1986.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.341" offset="416226">The Court's guidance in what is the constitutional minimal for an acceptable level of mental condition for commitment is found in the Addington decision, wherein the Court proscribed confinement for merely idiosyncratic behavior, or conduct that is not within the generally acceptable bounds of conduct.</text>
