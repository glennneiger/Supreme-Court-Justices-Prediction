            <text syncTime="89.539" offset="496384">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="92.311" offset="507459">This case arises from respondent's attempt to withdraw from his guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.865" offset="525745">Pursuant to a plea agreement in which the Government agreed to drop certain charges against him, respondent plead guilty... pleaded guilty to mail fraud and the receipt of stolen property in four counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.521" offset="568377">When... at the Rule 11 plea proceeding, the district court ascertained that respondent knew the nature of the charges that were brought against him, that he knew of the rights that he would be waiving by pleading guilty, that he knew the maximum sentence that he could face, that the court also ascertained that his guilty plea was entirely voluntary and uncoerced, and the court ascertained the facts of the crime as narrated both by respondent and as narrated by the prosecutor, and then he found out... he ascertained that the respondent agreed with the prosecutor's account.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.482" offset="696168">The court stated at that point, after having gone through that proceeding, that it would... that it accepted the guilty plea and that it would defer the decision about whether to accept or reject the plea agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.620" offset="744756">One month later, respondent attempted to withdraw from his guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.652" offset="764818">The court, the district court refused, finding that respondent had advanced no fair and just reason for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.658" offset="792926">The court of appeals reversed that decision, holding that the respondent could withdraw from his guilty plea at will for any reason or for no reason, as the court stated, and reversed the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.427" offset="843917">Now, our position is that respondent could withdraw from his guilty plea only if he had a fair and just reason for doing so under Rule 32(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.093" offset="886653">Because he had no fair and just reason in this case, the district court properly declined to permit him to withdraw.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.427" offset="911939">Permitting the withdrawal of an accepted guilty plea at the free option of the defendant is inconsistent with the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.295" offset="951437">Rule 32(e) provides that before sentence a district court may permit a defendant to withdraw from a guilty plea if he shows a fair and just reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.371" offset="987695">Now, the courts... courts that in... the courts that have to determine whether to accept a plea agreement ordinarily will do just what the district court did here, which is postpone a decision on the plea agreement until at or near the time of sentencing, when they've had a chance to review the presentence report.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.221" offset="1063136">Under the... and accept the guilty plea at the time of the Rule 11 hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.816" offset="1081526">Under the Ninth Circuit's rule in this case, the Rule 32(e) standard, the fair and just reason standard, would have virtually no application at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.010" offset="1118307">It would apply only for the minutes or hours or maybe days from the time that the district court has reviewed the presentence report and can make a decision about whether to accept or reject the plea agreement and the time of sentencing, which is really no time at all.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="259.672" offset="1176926">Mr. Feldman, there seems to be a certain amount of interchangeability of these terms in appellate opinions, acceptance of a plea, or acceptance of a plea agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.610" offset="1236694">In fact, until this case came along I don't think I had ever focused on the fact that there might be a difference in the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.445" offset="1264070">We tend to think of a plea as a plea agreement, and vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.989" offset="1282251">How often is it that these two are separated, the entry of a plea and a subsequent plea agreement, if you will?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="294.675" stopTime="310.056">
            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="294.675" offset="1316942">I think... Your Honor, I haven't been able to get... let me put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.909" offset="1333869">They are always separate in cases... virtually always separate in cases where a district court has to make a decision on a plea agreement, which is not in all guilty plea cases but is in a great many of them.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="310.056" stopTime="316.019">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="310.056" offset="1378486">Well, and how often is it that the district court has to separate the decision?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="316.019" stopTime="439.334">
            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="316.019" offset="1402310">As I said, I think it's in every case in which the Government agrees to drop certain charges in response for the defendant's... in exchange for the defendant's guilty plea, and when you have that kind of a plea agreement, under the Sentencing Guideline... under the Federal Rules of Procedure the district court is permitted to defer a decision on whether to accept that plea agreement, and under the guidelines it says that the district court is required to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.274" offset="1495306">In virtually all of those cases, and I'll tell you in a minute why I say virtually... in virtually all of those cases the district court will do just what the district court did here, which is accept the guilty plea in accordance with the rules for accepting a guilty plea in Rule 11, and defer a decision on a plea agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.835" offset="1557582">The only reason I say virtually all and not all is, there are two circumstances under which that won't happen in those charge-bargaining types of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.171" offset="1594885">One circumstance is where the district court defers decision on whether to accept the plea itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.217" offset="1623097">This is a very rare occurrence, but we cited a couple of cases in our brief where it happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.992" offset="1642219">The district court sees the... listens to the guilty plea, thinks there may be something wrong... I'm not sure... it doesn't really explain why the district court chose to do that, but there's nothing in the Federal Rules of Procedure that requires a district court to accept a guilty plea at the time it's tendered, and so if the guilty... if the court defers decision on whether to accept it, then everything may happen at once, usually at around the time of sentencing, both the acceptance of the plea and of the plea agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.228" offset="1739185">The other category of cases, which is also rare but not quite as rare as those, is cases where for some reason there was a preplea presentence report prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.156" offset="1778891">In those case the district court already has the presentence report at the time the plea is... the plea colloquy occurs under Rule 11 and therefore once again the district court can take care of everything at once, and there's no period of time during... between the time of accepting the plea and a decision on whether to accept or reject the plea agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.747" offset="1857259">But aside from those cases, this procedure that happened here I think is exactly by the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.003" offset="1878261">It's exactly what's envisioned by the Rules of Procedure, and it will happen in the majority of guilty plea cases.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="439.334" offset="1895606">And if at the end of the day the judge decides not to accept the plea agreement by virtue of what the judge reads in the presentence report, the rules permit the defendant to withdraw from the plea.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="454.475" stopTime="489.407">
            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>
            <text syncTime="454.475" offset="1956106">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.845" offset="1957673">The judge must at that point, under Rule... I think 11(e)(4), I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.267" offset="1975332">The rule... once the judge rejects the plea agreement, at that point what... the goal is to put the parties in the same position they would have been in if nothing had happened, if none of this had happened, because the agreement can't be carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.835" offset="2017546">A condition subsequent to the agreement is... has now failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.818" offset="2033533">And so what you would do is the same thing as you would do in ordinary contract cases when that kind of situation occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.940" offset="2057984">You give the defendant the option of withdrawing his guilty plea, and the Government, of course, at that point is no longer bound to carry out any commitments it has under the plea agreement, and--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="489.407" offset="2095913">Do we take this case on the assumption that there was no fair and just reason for the withdrawal within the meaning of the rule?</text>

          <turn speaker="james_a_feldman" startTime="499.755" stopTime="522.549">
            <label>Mr. James A. Feldman</label>

            <text syncTime="500.156" offset="2138859">That's... that was what... the court of appeals specifically held that the defendant was permitted to withdraw for any reason or for no reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.421" offset="2179923">The district court held that the reasons that were advanced by the respondent were not fair and just reasons, and that hasn't been challenged in this Court, so I think that we definitely... the case definitely comes before the Court in that posture.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.320" offset="2239482">Your opponent argues... I don't know how significant it is... that in the scenario you give, the difference is the judge will have seen the presentence report before the trial, which normally is not desirable.</text>

            <text syncTime="552.799" offset="2349406">In fact, it is rare that judges reject the agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.261" offset="2367273">Usually those are the agreements of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.843" offset="2373647">They're subject to a number of constraints and just don't ordinarily reject them, but that is something that could happen, and that would have to be taken care of that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.386" offset="4567828">But the basic result in this case, I think, is determined by the rules, because if I said under the Ninth Circuit's rule... first of all under Rule 32(e) the fair and just reason business would have been really entirely illusory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.855" offset="4617670">It would apply for a matter of a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.316" offset="4627492">And it's obvious if you look at that rule itself and the purposes behind it and what the advisory committee said when it added that in 1983, that was a rule... that was an important step.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.092" offset="4662601">It was intended to bolster the respect and the dignity of plea proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.356" offset="4683708">Plea proceedings are governed by Rule 11, which has in (A), (B), (C), and (D) of that rule has extensive provisions about exactly how a plea has to be taken, all the steps the judge has to take, which, in fact, the judge took here, and that once the defendant has gone through all of that, nobody should have the illusion that they're just free to walk away from it with no consequences at all, especially if they don't have a fair and just reason to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.962" offset="4782137">It's also our position that Rule 11 itself dictates this result in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.866" offset="4805752">Rule 11 in (A), (B), (C), and (D), talks about the plea and about accepting the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.271" offset="4831352">It doesn't, I don't think, mention the plea agreement, or if it does it talks about plea agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.542" offset="4848384">It's quite clear it's talking about pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.424" offset="4859982">It gets to (E), which is entitled Plea Agreement Procedure, and (E) was the provision that was added to deal with plea agreements, and the rule makes perfect sense and is perfectly consistent in its very precise differentiation between those provisions that have to do with acceptance of a guilty plea, which has to do with the defendant's confession in open court as to what he did, and those provisions that have to do with the plea agreement, which is an entirely different question, which has to do with the nature of the bargain and is treated in the (E) provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.994" offset="4974189">And indeed, in Rule 11(e)(4), the provision that we... that was mentioned earlier, where it says that the court... that if the court rejects the plea agreement the defendant shall be permitted to withdraw his plea, the whole notion there that the defendant can withdraw the plea I think has as its underlying assumption that there's been a valid, binding plea entered at that point, and there has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.088" offset="5070633">So I think the result that we're urging here is dictated by the Federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.901" offset="5085889">I also think the result we're urging here is dictated by the law of contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.073" offset="5098532">I think this is a fairly straightforward situation of a contract involving an exchange of a performance by the defendant for a promise by the Government to do something later, subject to a later condition, and everybody's bound to that unless the condition... once the plea is accepted... once the plea is accepted by the district court, unless the later condition doesn't occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.088" offset="5186617">I think that if there... under the Ninth Circuit's rule there would be a great deal of instability ejected into the plea-bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.793" offset="5217441">A defendant at any time during the several months that it takes to prepare the presentence report can just say, I changed my mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.757" offset="5249311">I don't want to go ahead and do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.840" offset="5257566">At that point, everything stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.271" offset="5267283">Well, that is a process that's at the unilateral whim of the defendant that's open to manipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.295" offset="5295391">It's open to a defendant who wants to obtain severance from codefendants to plead guilty and then just change his mind later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.369" offset="5319737">It's open to the possibility that a defendant who's just trying to delay an inevitable imprisonment could do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.764" offset="5345337">It's even open to a defendant who sees that the Government... in this case, for example, the guilty plea was taken at the morning of trial, which is not at all uncommon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.600" offset="5384625">Once... you see that the Government has assembled all of its witnesses once.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.323" offset="5399567">A couple of months later there may be some witnesses who are unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.614" offset="5412733">There may be witnesses who are no longer in the jurisdiction, or even, in a sufficiently extreme case, a defendant might take steps to see to it that those things happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.551" offset="5452439">All of those things can happen if you give the defendant this free window of several months after the plea to just change his mind, and I think if the advisory committee had proposed that kind of a rule, I think it clearly would have been rejected because of the instability it lends to the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.161" offset="5518895">Another consequence it can have is that the preparation of the presentence report itself ordinarily requires the cooperation of both the defendant and the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.078" offset="5558601">Now, presumably if both parties are free to just withdraw at whim during this period between the guilty plea proceedings and the... basically and sentencing, it would be... it's very hard for the parties to lend the kind of cooperation to the probation officer that they would have to do, since neither is sure that the information that they're providing wouldn't ultimately be... they're now revealing it to a party who could easily, at that party's own whim, become the opposing party at a trial, and I think it would make preparation of those reports very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.058" offset="5686496">And again, in this case, in fact, the preparation of the presentence report was delayed while all of this... proceedings were going on in the district court, because respondent wasn't cooperating with the probation officer during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.507" offset="5736233">Finally, I think that it's inconsistent with the dignity and respect that judicial proceedings should have that a formal Rule 11 proceeding in open court should have... should basically be able to be rendered a nullity by the defendant's unilateral action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.959" offset="5806033">A defendant... if you read... I think it's worth looking at the plea proceeding here, which is in the joint appendix, and it was all gone through very carefully with the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.443" offset="5839992">He knew what he was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.665" offset="5844903">He knew the nature of the charges and the possible sentence, and all... he shouldn't be able to walk out of the courtroom and then say, well, I haven't decided yet whether I'm going to plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.231" offset="5887221">It's true I just, under oath, told the court about the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.634" offset="5900805">I confessed, I went through all this, but I may change my mind and I'll make up my mind in a couple of months.</text>

            <text syncTime="2856.720" offset="11565092">The judge's sentencing authority was not limited in any respect by the plea agreement, so the judge could accept that agreement without at all limiting his or her sentencing authority without waiting for the presentence report, and that may be the case in many, many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.585" offset="11644609">If there are cases where there is reason to think that his sentencing discretion is going to be limited in some way, where there is a mandatory minimum sentence that might be eliminated, or where there's a very low maximum sentence in the charged or the pleaded-to agreement or count, that there would be significant limits on the judge's sentencing authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.999" offset="11742202">In those cases the judge would want to see... may want to see the presentence report.</text>

            <text syncTime="3045.296" offset="12319404">If the rule has not addressed the situation, if the guidelines have in some way increased the frequency with which judges defer approval of the agreement by using mandatory language, perhaps the way to resolve the conflict is to have the Sentencing Commission take another look at this, the Sentencing Commission or the Rules Committee through the rules amendment proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3127.289" offset="12647397">There are also many disincentives for a defendant to back out of an agreement the way the Government has suggested will happen frequently, or to use it for delay.</text>
