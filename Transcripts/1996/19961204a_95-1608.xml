            <text syncTime="27.318" offset="252006">This case is here on a writ of certiorari from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.422" offset="268411">The issue is whether the laws of Minnesota and those of some 40 other States that limit each candidate to one party designation on the election ballot should be overridden by the desire of a party to place on that ballot as its candidate someone who is already on the ballot as a candidate of another party.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.687" offset="361511">In this case, Minnesota's law preventing multiple party nominations prevented the respondent New Party from placing on the Minnesota election ballot as its candidate Representative Andy Dawkins, a Democratic-Farmer-Labor legislator who was already on the ballot as the DFL candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.830" offset="446043">The case involves a narrow aspect of political party activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.374" offset="468300">It is not about the ability of a party to generally select its candidates.</text>
