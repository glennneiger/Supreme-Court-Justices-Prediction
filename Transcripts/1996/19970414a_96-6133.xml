            <text syncTime="184.247" offset="867389">I think all of this Court's analysis of this issue has always looked to the biasing influence itself, and whether it was sufficiently strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.220" offset="907199">If the biasing influence, which in this case was corruption, has been deemed to be sufficiently severe, this Court has always presumed prejudice and has not looked to the question of whether or not the judge in a particular case was actually biased towards the particular defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.847" offset="977730">However, if actual bias were the standard, which we maintain it isn't, we believe that we may be able to show that if we're given access to the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.198" offset="1123180">We may be able to explore the possibility that there was a corrupt relationship between Judge Maloney and the person that he appointed to be my client's attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.637" offset="1160900">We believe that we may be able to show examples of instances where Judge Maloney was corrupt in other cases in which he didn't receive bribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.243" offset="1199353">We believe that, as the Government sensing memorandum in the Maloney case indicated, we believe that we may be able to show a lot of corruption going on right at the same time as Mr. Bracy's trial, so that Judge Maloney would have had to have leaned in favor of the State just to be generally impartial.</text>

            <text syncTime="302.966" offset="1342190">I think that we... before I can proceed with discovery we have to show something more than bare allegations, as I understand this Court's interpretation of Habeas Rule 6(e).</text>

            <text syncTime="318.492" offset="1404362">We think the showing was sufficient to allow us to proceed forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.793" offset="1417527">The judicial corruption, at least in my estimation, is worse than the type of situations that this Court has previously held to be a sufficient biasing influence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2735.705" offset="11073220">And the basis in the record is that Robert McDonald was appointed in the middle of June 1981.</text>

            <text syncTime="2756.949" offset="11158171">On July 20, which is the first day of Mr. Bracy's trial, the State announced that it intended to introduce the evidence of the Arizona murder case as aggravation evidence in the event that there was a conviction on the homicide charge, and although another attorney who represented a codefendant Mr. Hooper asked for a continuance because he needed more opportunity to prepare, Mr. McDonald didn't say a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.116" offset="11270811">And the additional fact that I would throw into the equation there is simply there is some suggestion in the record that was before Judge Hart that there was a professional... a previous professional connection sometime between Mr. McDonald and former Judge Maloney, and that, to me at least, raises questions as to whether or not there was some kind of fix as to the timing of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.930" offset="11354089">If I may conclude, Chief Judge Posner in his majority opinion in the Seventh Circuit... and I would respectfully call the Court's attention to the top of page 82 of the joint appendix... said, we are, it is true, speculating about the likely impact of Mr. Maloney's corruption on the rulings that he made at the trial of these petitioners.</text>
