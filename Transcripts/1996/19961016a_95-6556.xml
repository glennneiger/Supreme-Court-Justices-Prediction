            <text syncTime="2838.614" offset="11495526">In 1975 the rule was settled that we didn't have to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.159" offset="11513707">If you disagree that a stipulation is something that can be forced upon the Government, then it only comes into play once it has given us adequate insurance against the risk of nonpersuading the jury, which means that it has to be coupled with an instruction that effectively tells the jury that we are home on the element, have no doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.333" offset="11602419">In this case, and it bears emphasis, while tendering an instruction that ostensibly took this issue from the jury, Mr. Old Chief also tendered an instruction that reminded the jury that we kept the burden of proof on every element of the crime, and that is exactly the danger that I'm trying to highlight for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.105" offset="11681518">All of the issues that Justice Breyer brought up, whether you could enter a severance, whether you could have a redacted judgment, had to do with how courts have traditionally dealt with evidence before and after the Rules of Evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2946.144" offset="11925710">That flows not from a case from this Court, Justice Ginsburg, but from a recognition that the Advisory Committee note indicates that the availability of alternative means of proof is a factor that should be considered by a court in ruling on the admissibility of evidence under Rule 403, and conceivably, the existence of a stipulation that acts as an alternative means of proof, if it is, in fact, such, should be considered in keeping with what the Advisory Committee said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.218" offset="12061965">That is not to say that unless we're entering 20 judgments of conviction, or we're doing other things of the type that Rule 403 contemplates, that we're not entitled to prove our case in our own way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.516" offset="12111180">There is a vast difference in saying that the judge can keep the case moving along after considering all relevant facts and saying that we're going to have for the first time as a rule of law the proposition that the criminal defendant can dictate how the Government's case is tried, because acceptance of the latter proposition is what we're fighting here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3029.229" offset="12257988">Even if you assume it is relevant to show it isn't an antitrust violation, which is I guess the only way in which it's relevant, that it isn't a business violation... there was an argument in the court about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.915" offset="12296753">We did think that there was tremendously unfair prejudice, and the reason that it was unfair prejudice was because there would be concern, as the policy of Rule 404 suggests, that a jury uncertain about whether the person committed the crime in front of them... in front of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.006" offset="12357149">You know, the present crime... might think, well, I've just learned he was a triple ax murderer, he was... in fact had loads of drugs previously, in fact beat his family, in fact did seven other really quite bad things previously, and therefore, although I, the juror, am uncertain about whether he committed the present crime, he's a bad guy, we'll put him away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.877" offset="12436561">I mean, it's that kind of unfair prejudice that we thought might flow from introducing the irrelevant, except for antitrust, fact of the nature of the previous crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="3087.598" offset="12491522">Well, the answer, Justice Breyer, is that the irrelevant item of evidence is the judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.271" offset="12514197">The Rules of Evidence treat the possibility that parts of a relevant piece of evidence will be misused not as a question of relevancy but as a question to be dealt with under Rule 105 with limiting instructions, because a background principle of our system is that juries will follow such instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.574" offset="12591415">With respect, I would also suggest to you that part of what drove the court of appeals in Tavares is a little bit of a disagreement with the congressional policy that is reflected in the statute, that it is unfair to have a crime that holds someone who has already done his time and paid his debt to society, but if the evidence is what Congress necessarily must have anticipated would be used to prove that element of the crime, you may think that it is not a fair statute, but that's not a problem with the evidence, it's a problem with the policy of the statute, which is for the people across the street.</text>
