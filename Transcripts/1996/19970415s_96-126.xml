            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="5.237" offset="102443">We review and reverse in this case, a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.393" offset="135044">In 1990, Georgia enacted a law requiring candidates for certain state offices to certify that they have taken a urinalysis drug test and that the test result was negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.861" offset="204947">Petitioners are Libertarian Party nominees for Lieutenant Governor and other elected officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.512" offset="231592">Proceeding in federal court, they challenged Georgia’s ballot access drug testing law as incompatible with the Fourth Amendment but the Fourth Amendment’s protection against unreasonable searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.838" offset="300869">The district court and then the Court of Appeals upheld the drug testing scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.568" offset="327723">It is uncontested that the urine collection and test Georgia requires counts as asserts within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment because it intrudes untraditional expectations of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.189" offset="398254">The pivotal question we confront is whether the search is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.453" offset="419256">To be reasonable, a search ordinarily must stem from individualized suspicion of wrongdoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.646" offset="460112">Exceptions to the main rule of suspicion focused on particular individual maybe warranted however, when the state has special needs beyond the normal need for law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.679" offset="524164">We have upheld as justified by such special needs, drug testing programs for student athletes, custom service offices transferred to dangerous or sensitive post, and railway employees involved in accidents and safety violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.273" offset="598561">Relying on these precedents, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that the Georgia statute satisfied the Fourth Amendment’s reasonableness requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.142" offset="642028">In an opinion distinguishing our prior decisions, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.900" offset="669091">Georgia’s requirement that candidate for state office pass a urinalysis drug test does not fit within the closely guarded category of constitutionally permissible suspicion list searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.309" offset="730740">The statute, all agree, was not enacted in response to any fear or suspicion of illegal drug use by Georgia state officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.579" offset="771805">Counsel for respondents acknowledged the absence of any such problem in the state and the certification requirement is not well designed to identify candidates who violate anti-drug laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.817" offset="832722">The test date is picked by the candidate, so all but the uncontrollably addicted for the state protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.777" offset="872637">Respondents rely heavily on our decision in Treasury Employees v. Von Raab in which we sustained a drug testing program for custom service employees transferred to certain high risk positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.491" offset="931465">We did so despite the absence of documented evidence of a drug abuse problem among custom service employees but Von Raab arose in a unique setting, drug interdiction had become the agency’s primary enforcement mission and the covered posts directly involved drug interdiction or require the employee to carry a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.722" offset="1040343">The solitary nature of the customs service employees' work limited to service could not these of the subject the offices in question to the day-to-day scrutiny that is a norm in more traditional work environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.042" offset="1105649">In contrast, the day-to-day conduct of candidates for public office attract attention notably beyond the norm in ordinary work environments.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.203" offset="1154342">What is left after close review of Georgia scheme, is the state interest, not in public safety but in projecting an image, Georgia seeks to display to the public its firm commitment to the struggle against drug abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.899" offset="1225081">The need projected, unlike the need demonstrated in prior decisions is symbolic, not actual and special.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.363" offset="1274923">However well meant, the candidate drug test that Georgia has devised diminishes personal privacy for a symbol’s sake.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.786" offset="1316614">The Fourth Amendment shields society against state action of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.605" offset="1343886">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
