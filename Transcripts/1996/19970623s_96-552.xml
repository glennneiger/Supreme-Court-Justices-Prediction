            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="82252">The opinion of the Court in No. 96-552, Agostini against Felton and a related case will be announced by Justice O’Connor.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="9.460" offset="120077">These are cases come here on writs of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.018" offset="146304">For 30 years now, New York City has been providing remedial instruction on guidance counseling to economically disadvantaged school children.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.599" offset="184548">These services had been provided with federal funds pursuant to a congressionally enacted program commonly called Title I.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.446" offset="215999">In order to receive Title I funds, school district, like the one in New York City, are required to provide Title I services to as many eligible children in their districts as they can, whether those children attend public or private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.613" offset="276603">Although only about 10% of New York City school children attend private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.874" offset="297710">Almost all of those private schools are affiliated with a religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.863" offset="317668">Thus, the Board of Education of the City of New York has been required to provide Title I services to some children attending religious schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.419" offset="351836">For some years, the Board provided Title I services to children attending religious schools from the premises of those schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.943" offset="381929">These services were provided by publicly employed teachers and guidance counselors who often travel from school to school.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.848" offset="413589">They were assigned to schools without regard to their religious preferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.085" offset="430516">These employees were also given instructions not to inculcate religion in the course of their duties and not to cooperate with religious school officials any more than necessary to provide the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.830" offset="477537">The services themselves could only supplement the level of remedial instruction and guidance counseling services already provided by the private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.587" offset="516512">The Title I services had to be purely secular in content.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.269" offset="535320">In 1978, six federal taxpayers sued the New York City Board on the grounds that New York’s program to provide Title I services to religious school students at their school violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.672" offset="596864">Seven years later, in a case called Aguilar versus Felton, this Court agreed with the taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.262" offset="623300">This Court, in Aguilar, reasoned that public employees who work in religious schools would be either unable or unwilling to resist the pressures of the pervasively sectarian atmosphere present in those schools, and would begin to read religious messages into their instruction or counseling.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.927" offset="693935">The Aguilar majority found that the supervision necessary to prevent inculcation of religion in the schools created an excessive entanglement between church and state and accordingly violated the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.470" offset="760077">On remand, from that decision, the District Court entered an injunction permanently enjoining the New York City Board of Education from offering Title I services on the premises of religious schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.198" offset="810964">Bound by this injunction, the Board explored other methods of serving the 10% of students who attend that religious schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.382" offset="839699">The most common alternative was to provide the Title I services in mobile classroom buses parked near the religious schools; sometimes at the very curbside of those schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.296" offset="887346">As expected, the cost of renting these buses or leasing them was high.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.517" offset="908244">The Board spent over $100 million to provide these off campus services, since our decision in Aguilar was handed down.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.284" offset="943352">Last year, the Board of Education moved in the Federal District Court for release from the injunction under Rule 60(b)(5) of the Federal Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.189" offset="986925">Rule 60 (b)(5) gives the court the power to excuse a party from judgment in a case when it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have perspective application.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.620" offset="1036662">The School Board argued that the circumstances had changed since we decided Aguilar, so that it was no longer equitable to enforce the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.660" offset="1072815">First, they claimed that the exorbitant costs of complying with the injunction were changed factual circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.083" offset="1102490">Second, the Board claimed that Aguilar was no longer a good law because five of the justices in a case called Kiryas Joel had recently called for Aguilar to be reconsidered.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.668" offset="1152854">Third, the Board argued that Aguilar itself had been undermined by our more recent decisions, specifically Witters versus Washington Department of Services for the Blind and Zobrest versus Catalina Foothills School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.891" offset="1209801">The District Court denied the Board's Rule 60(b)(5) motion largely on the ground that it was bound by Aguilar as precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.095" offset="1242611">The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.964" offset="1254105">In an opinion filed with the Clerk of the Court today, we reverse the judgment of the District Court, and order that relief be granted under Rule 60(b)(5).</text>
            <text syncTime="302.996" offset="1294229">Although we find that the high cost of complying with the injunction do not constitute a change in the factual circumstances, that change was anticipated, and that the statements of five justices in Kiryas Joel do not constitute a change in the law, we agree with the Board that our decisions are subsequent decisions and  Witters and Zobrest have eroded the rationale upon which the Aguilar relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.530" offset="1404361">In Witters we upheld the program that allowed a blind student to use public vocational training funds to attend the religious school, and in Zobrest we held that a public school district could pay for a signlanguage interpreter to assist a student who attended a religious high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.384" offset="1475728">These recent cases have abandoned the presumption that public employees will inculcate religion simply because they teach in a classroom located on the premises of a colloquial school.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.638" offset="1524734">Without this presumption, the system of supervising Title I teachers that New York City already had in place is sufficient to ensure that Title I services remain secular and that the system is not an excessive entanglement between church and state.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.379" offset="1591712">Accordingly, we find Aguilar as no longer good law.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.921" offset="1605922">There has been a significant change in the law wanting Rule 60(b) relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.194" offset="1626925">We furthermore conclude that the Board’s use of Rule 60(b)(5) is proper because it arises in the narrow context of the civil case where a party labors under a continuing injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.132" offset="1678752">Justice Souter has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens and Ginsburg join in full and in which Justice Breyer joins in part; Justice Ginsburg has filed a dissenting opinion in which Justices Stevens, Souter, and Breyer join.</text>
