            <text syncTime="7.911" offset="113397">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.883" offset="133354">A federal grand jury indicted the respondents, Wells and Steele on charges of violating and conspiring to violate Section 1014 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code which prohibits making certain false statements to an FDIC insured bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.882" offset="201273">The indictment alleged that the respondents had provided several banks with false information when they applied for financing to save their financially-troubled company.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.189" offset="238576">At the end of the trial, the District Court told the jury that it did not need to determine whether the respondent’s allegedly false statements were material.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.905" offset="269400">That is, whether the statements were capable of influencing the bank’s decisions but, he, the judge would make that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.720" offset="296672">The jury found the respondents guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.931" offset="305554">The respondents' appealed their conviction to the Eighth Circuit and argued that materiality is an element of Section 1014 and and that they were entitled to have the jury determine whether any false statements were material.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.166" offset="350484">The Court of Appeals agreed and remanded the case for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.939" offset="365531">In an opinion filed today with the Clerk of Court, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and hold that materiality is not an element under Section 1014.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.447" offset="403565">The statute does not explicitly mention materiality but instead provides simply that whoever knowingly makes any false statement or report for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of any bank, the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC upon any application commitment or a loan shall be fined not more than a million dollars or imprisonment and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.950" offset="489560">We find no reason to justify departing from the text and reading materiality element into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.988" offset="513697">Respondents have made two other arguments which relate to the jury instruction and the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.879" offset="533341">Because the Respondents did not raise these issues in the brief they submitted to the Eighth Circuit and because the Court of Appeals did not address them in its opinion, we remand the case to allow the Court of Appeals to consider whether the respondents properly raised those issues and address them if it is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.677" offset="592483">Justice Stevens has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
