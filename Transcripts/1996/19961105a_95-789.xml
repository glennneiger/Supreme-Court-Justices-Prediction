            <text syncTime="1030.208" offset="4262401">The other point I would like to address is, the Dillingham rule really interferes with the interest in uniformity that motivated much of ERISA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.573" offset="4303884">What we have is a rule that makes the definition of apprentice on State public works the same as Federal, and ERISA's theory about the need for uniformity was that uniformity promotes the furtherance of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.704" offset="4356442">The Dillingham rule does the opposite, because the sound system apprentices here, for example, could not work on a Davis-Bacon job in California, Oregon, Nevada or anywhere else.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.667" offset="4416210">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.138" offset="4478173">It's the position of the United States that the judgment in this case should be reversed, both because the State's prevailing wage law does not relate to ERISA plans and because, if it did, it would be saved under the section 114040... 1144(d) savings clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.195" offset="4534388">With regard to the relates-to issue, our position is that the general principle is that where a State is regulating an activity, that an employer may carry out through an ERISA plan or may carry out through a non-ERISA plan, and where the State's regulation neither encourages nor discourages, nor prohibits nor requires the employer from doing it by means of the ERISA plan, that the State regulation is not preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.040" offset="4633758">In that case, it would be most natural to say that the State's regulation relates to the activity at issue, here training programs, and not to ERISA plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.766" offset="4668657">Now, in Shaw v. Delta Airlines, if you look at the last few pages, the last issue that the Court dealt with in its opinion in that case concerned a New York State regulation of disability insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.244" offset="4710558">It was clear that disability insurance could be offered either by an employer through an ERISA plan, or it could be offered through a non-ERISA plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.399" offset="4735217">The Court held that even for those employees who choose to offer it through an ERISA plan, that that doesn't render... they can't thereby immunize themselves from the State's regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.366" offset="4775028">The State's regulation related to disability laws, not to ERISA plans, and therefore the State could continue to enforce those regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1177.850" offset="4852977">I think... well, the basis is this Court's decision in Massachusetts v. Morash, and the Secretary of Labor's regulations on which that was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.805" offset="4884847">Apprenticeship... apprenticeship, it's not just apprenticeship, it's apprenticeship and other training programs, and those are ubiquitous in the workplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.901" offset="4913164">Training goes on every day at all degrees of formality, from totally informal to very formal programs in every workplace in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.736" offset="4944510">Congress did not intend, when it enacted ERISA, as the Court recognizes in Massachusetts v. Morash, it didn't intend to oust the States from their very traditional jurisdiction over their basic employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.512" offset="4991635">That is, the employer gives money to the employee, and the employee does what the employer tells the employee to do, and if that's get trained, then the employee gets trained.</text>
