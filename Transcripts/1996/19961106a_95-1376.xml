            <text syncTime="21.645" offset="224893">Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="27.849" offset="249761">This case presents the question: Does the provision of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that prohibits retaliation against, quote, employees, unquote, for filing charges of discrimination or otherwise availing themselves of their rights under Title VII... namely Section 704(a)... does that section cover former employees, employees such as Petitioner, Charles Robinson, who were discharged prior to the alleged retaliation?</text>
            <text syncTime="70.846" offset="421751">In this case, after Charles Robinson was terminated by Shell Oil, he filed a charge of discrimination against Shell under Title VII, and subsequently, Shell gave him a negative job reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.138" offset="478907">He then brought the present action, alleging that that negative reference was made in retaliation for his earlier charge of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.036" offset="526450">The Fourth Circuit held that Charles Robinson was not even entitled to have the court determine whether that reference was retaliatory, because he was not employed by Shell at the time of the reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.188" offset="607116">If Shell had given him that reference the day before he was terminated, everyone agrees, he would have had that right to a judicial determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.415" offset="779942">Or even if you're not going to be fired, even if you just intend to quit, it would be very wise, before you quit, to file an EEOC complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.611" offset="812752">Because then, if... if the employer gives you a bad reference in... in your later job, he takes the risk of being sued for that, on the basis of retaliation.</text>
