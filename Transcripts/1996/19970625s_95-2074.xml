            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="82310">The opinion of the Court in No. 95-2074, City of Boerne versus Flores will be announced by Justice Kennedy.</text>

            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="9.802" offset="121494">The Saint Peter Catholic Church in Boerne, Texas was built in 1923 and it is said that replicate the mission style of that region’s earlier history that actually proved to be a problem for the Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.267" offset="171335">The Archbishop had given approval for a remodeling plan with cause alterations to the structure to increase the size of the Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.783" offset="201428">Because of the niche in style the Church was said by local authorities to be subject to the restrictions of a historic preservation zone, so the building permit was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.763" offset="233298">Now, the church, through the Archbishop, challenged the denial in Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.099" offset="250643">The complaint contained various claims but to this point, the litigation has sent it on the constitutionality of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.458" offset="296096">The Act is abbreviated RFRA and then you supply a vowel to pronounce it RFRA.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.485" offset="316158">The Church claims that because of the protection afforded to it by RFRA is exempt from the zoning restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.951" offset="338101">The District Court found RFRA unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.392" offset="351789">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, and we now reverse the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.369" offset="371747">Congress enacted RFRA in direct response to our decision in Employment Division versus Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.911" offset="393899">In Smith we held that a neutral generally applicable law consistent with the Free Exercise Clause need not be justified by a compelling governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.133" offset="426813">Even if it is substantially burden the religious practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.086" offset="438620">RFRA thought to alter that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.628" offset="448756">RFRA requires that all laws whether federal or state must be justified by a compelling governmental interest and employ the least restrictive means of furthering that interest whenever it substantially burdens a religious practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.120" offset="494731">Our Federal Government is one of the enumerated powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.305" offset="503508">Congress relied on its Fourteenth Amendment enforcement power in enacting the most far reaching and substantial of RFRA's provisions of which impose its requirements from states and local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.577" offset="544573">The question posed by this case is whether RFRA enforces the Free Exercise Clause as interpreted by Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.243" offset="567247">Congress’ power under Section 5 extends only to enforcing the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.620" offset="588772">Legislation which deters or remedies its constitutional violations can fall within the suite of Congress’ enforcement power.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.046" offset="618447">However, Congress does not have the power to decree the substance of the Fourteenth Amendment’s restrictions on the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.610" offset="644674">While the line between measures that remedy and prevent unconstitutional actions, and measures that make substantive change in the governing law is not easy to determine, and Congress must have a wide latitude in determining where it lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.805" offset="693471">The distinction exists and it must be observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.118" offset="706741">It must be congruent in proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied in the means adopted to that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.819" offset="733490">The Fourteenth Amendment’s history and our case will confirm the remedial rather than substantive nature of the Enforcement Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.845" offset="761598">RFRA is not a proper exercise of Congress’ remedial or preventive power.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.137" offset="778839">In this regard, a comparison between RFRA and the Voting Rights Act is instrictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.827" offset="797543">In contrast to the record which confronted Congress and the judiciary in the Voting Rights cases, RFRA’s legislative record lacks examples of modern infrences of generally applicable laws passed because of religious bigotry.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.149" offset="842891">Moreover, RFRA’s coverage is sweeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.869" offset="849683">It applies to every level of government and to all rules regardless of subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.361" offset="867655">Its least restrictive means compelling governmental interest test is the most demanding known to the constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.689" offset="893046">This is a considerable congressional intrusion into the states' traditional prerogative and general authority to regulate for the health and welfare of their citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.515" offset="924289">The substantial cause RFRA exacts far exceed any pattern or practice of unconstitutional conduct under the Free Exercise Clause of as interpreted in Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.928" offset="965980">When Congress acts within its fair power and responsibility, it has not just the right but the duty to make its own informed judgment on the meaning and force of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.364" offset="1003701">On the other hand, when the court has interpreted the Constitution, it has acted within the province of the Judicial Branch which embraces the duty to say what the law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.579" offset="1036615">When the political branches of the government act against a background of a judicial interpretation of the constitutional already issued, it must be understood that in later cases and controversies, the court will treat its precedents with the respect due them under settled principles including stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.649" offset="1092831">Contrary expectations must be disappointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.555" offset="1104429">RFRA was designed to control cases and controversies such as the one before us, but as the provisions of the federal statute here invoked are beyond congressional authority, it is this Court’s president and not RFRA which must control.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.164" offset="1150927">Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion; Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part joined by Justice Stevens; Justice O’Connor has filed a dissenting opinion joined in part by Justice Breyer; Justices Souter and Breyer have filed dissenting opinion.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="281.443" offset="1207979">I would agree with the Court in its opinion in this case today if I thought the Court’s decision seven years ago in Employment Division versus Smith, set forth the proper standard under the First Amendment, but I do not, and as a result, I dissent from the Court’s disposition of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.354" offset="1291675">In order to accept the Court’s conclusion that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is unconstitutional, one must first accept the Court’s current interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause we could set forth in Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.413" offset="1343920">It was the court’s decision in that case that prompted Congress to enact the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.399" offset="1371819">In my view, Smith does not reflect the correct understanding of the federal Free Exercise Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.745" offset="1397210">The court’s holding in that case has harmed religious liberty in our nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.519" offset="1416331">I would direct the parties in this case to address the scope of the First Amendment's guarantee a religious free exercise and set the case for the argument next term.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.191" offset="1459068">Our citizens hold many different religious beliefs and subscribed to a variety of faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.471" offset="1484145">Governmental regulation in our society today is pervasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.755" offset="1501281">Given these characteristics of religious pluralism and extensive government regulation, there are times when a person’s religiously motivated conduct conflicts with a generally applicable secular law.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.329" offset="1555616">In Smith, this Court without actual briefing our argument on the issue, held that government need not justify the burdens it places on religious practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.849" offset="1597621">No matter how extensive, so long as the law imposes such burdens in a generally applicable law.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.166" offset="1630953">In adopting this rule, the court abandoned the approach it had taken to free exercise claims for some decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.871" offset="1661778">Before Smith, this Court had interpreted the Free Exercise Clause in a number of cases to require the government to justify any substantial burden it placed on religious free exercise with a compelling state interest and a showing that the burden was the most narrowly tailored means of achieving that interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.297" offset="1739414">I continued to believe that this compelling interest approach to free exercise claims more faithfully serves the intentions of the framers of the federal Free Exercise Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.936" offset="1786016">I would therefore return to such a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.219" offset="1799182">In my dissenting opinion filed today, I examined the early American tradition of religious free exercise to gain insight into the original understanding of that clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.168" offset="1846934">The historical record reveals that its drafters and ratifiers viewed the Free Exercise Clause as a guarantee that government may not unnecessarily hinder believers from freely practicing their religions.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.719" offset="1901164">For example, nearly all the constitutions that the early states which were adopted at roughly the same time as the federal Bill of Rights, guaranteed free exercise of religion limited by particular defined state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.112" offset="1958738">In the days before the Constitution was ratified when religious practice conflicted with the generally applicable law, state legislatures frequently exempted believers from the requirements of such laws including, for example, requirements of taking an oath, military conscription, and religious assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.533" offset="2036374">The framers of the federal Free Exercise Clause drafted and ratified the clause against that historical backdrop.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.256" offset="2067303">They conceived that the nation recepted to voluntary religious expression, not of a secular society in which religious excretion is tolerated only when it does not conflict with a generally applicable law.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.100" offset="2122682">The rule the court adopted in Smith provides a bright line that is more easily applied but it is not faithful, I think, to the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.775" offset="2161343">I believe that it is important that this court reconsider its holding in Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.256" offset="2179316">I would do so in this very case.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.777" offset="2189347">If the court were to correct the misinterpretation of the Free Exercise Clause set forth in Smith, it would simultaneously put our First Amendment jurisprudence back on course and would allay the legitimate concerns of a majority in Congress who believed that Smith improperly restricted religious liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.424" offset="2263952">We would then be able to review the constitutionality of the Act in light of a proper interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.411" offset="2295926">I therefore dissent from the Court’s disposition.</text>
