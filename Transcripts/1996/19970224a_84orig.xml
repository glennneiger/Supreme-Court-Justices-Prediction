            <text syncTime="36.845" offset="322066">This case presents four questions of title to submerged lands along the 500 miles of Alaska's north coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.711" offset="357488">The first question is whether Alaska's boundaries where there are fringing islands less than 10 miles apart should be determined under the 10-mile rule that this Court in the Alabama and Mississippi boundary case found was the United States policy from 1903 to 1961, a period during which Alaska became a State, or under the more limiting arcs-of-circles method that the United States first applied to fringing islands in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.441" offset="484443">The second question is whether Dinkum Sands, an alluvial feature similar to the mudlumps off the Louisiana coast that the Court in the Louisiana boundary case found were islands, is an island... whether Dinkum Sands is an island.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.094" offset="559048">The third question is whether Congress in section 11(b) of the Alaska Statehood Act defeated Alaska's title to the lands underlying coastal lagoons in the National Petroleum Reserve, Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.702" offset="609517">And the final question is whether Congress in section 6(e) of the Alaska Statehood Act defeated Alaska's title to the coastal lagoons in the vicinity of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.391" offset="656224">An application for the refuge had been filed before statehood, but the refuge was not established until after statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.554" offset="684854">The Court has addressed strikingly similar issues in prior submerged lands cases that date back more than 150 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.461" offset="724560">On each of the four questions presented here, the United States asks the Court to depart from those prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.134" offset="755176">The Court should reject the United States' invitation and treat Alaska as it has treated other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.260" offset="783702">The first question here is whether the parties' submerged lands ownership in areas enclosed by near-shore fringing islands should be determined under the 10-mile rule or the arcs-of-circles method.</text>

            <text syncTime="440.248" offset="1935702">The evidence in our case shows that among those countries with coastlines amenable to the use of the alternative method in the convention, the straight baseline method, the United States is the only country in the world that does not employ that method, that has no particular foreign policy reason for not doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.793" offset="2021906">The evidence in our case also shows that the United States has made a determination, the State Department legal advisor made a determination in 1971 that there is no reason for the United States not to use straight baselines less than 10 miles long in Southeast Alaska, where the 10-mile rule had its origin in the 1903 Alaska boundary arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.358" offset="2108110">So we have a situation where the United States from 1903 to 1961 used a delimitation method that provided these lands were inland waters, that was in existence when Alaska joined the union in 1959, and in 1971, for the first time, moved to the arcs-of-circles method that creates these enclaves and pockets which the State Department in 1930 described as anomalous, objectionable, and undesirable, and with no perceivable foreign policy reason for making this change.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.143" offset="2263277">The inference which we draw from this is that following the Court's adoption of the Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone in 1965 for submerged lands purposes, the only reason the United States changed from the 10-mile rule to the method of arcs of circles was because it gave it an advantage in these cases where the geography of the coastline is like the geography of Alaska's North Slope.</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.588" offset="11972991">In fact I think that this is... this case... the question that has been posed in this case is whether the United States had a historic policy of applying a straight baseline instead of using a 10-mile rule, and in fact that's the issue that I would like to address here, because I think we do need some clarification on a few points with regard to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.580" offset="12037044">We think that the historic bay provisions of the convention provide an adequate opportunity for Alaska to raise claims that there has been a contraction of recognized territory by the United States, but even if you disagree with us on that point, we think the Master is quite correct in his historical analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.650" offset="12105275">What he concluded after a careful review of the history is that the United States never had a policy of enclosing lands behind islands under a 10-mile rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.886" offset="12138190">As he explained, there was a concession in the 1903 Alaska arbitration saying that we did not object to it in the specific context of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.892" offset="12174239">There was no mention of that policy again, and in 1930 the United States provided formal comments on the... to The Hague Conference on the Territorial Sea, or on the Law of the Sea, and in that case the United States did not use a 10-mile rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.820" offset="12229932">Instead, it used an inconsistent methodology, namely a rule of assimilation, so the United States had no such policy in 1930, the one time in which it made a formal statement to the international community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.217" offset="12275594">The Special Master went on and catalogued the history from 1930 past Alaska's statehood, and indicates quite convincingly that there never was a formal policy of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.864" offset="12314151">There were various statements that may have been made at one time or another that suggested the 10-mile... a 10-mile rule might be applicable under particular circumstances such as, for example, the case of straits leading to an inland sea, but there was no formalized policy and, in fact, Alaska's own expert, Professor Charney, agreed with that result.</text>

            <text syncTime="3087.360" offset="12524175">In the case... and the statement made in the Alabama case, you must remember, was tied to particular facts that were involved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.752" offset="12549671">As the Court indicated, this was a bay that involved certain cul-de-sacs, and so it could arguably fit within the geography of straits leading to an inland sea, but it does not establish a rule for fringing islands, and what the Court said I think in California II is really quite pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.834" offset="12610066">Before today's decision... I'm reading from page 24 of our brief, which quotes the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.445" offset="12632426">Before today's decision, no one could say with assurance where lay the line of inland waters as contemplated by the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.399" offset="12656250">Hence, there could have been no tenable reliance on any particular line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.654" offset="12669311">After today, that situation will have changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.628" offset="12681223">The very reason that the Court adopted the convention in 1965 was to provide certainty and assurance, and to rule otherwise in this case would simply upset what has been the controlling rule in all of the cases the Court has decided in its original jurisdiction respecting the tidelands, and that is precisely why we think the Court should adhere to California II and apply the convention strictly, and even if it goes beyond that, it will find that there is not a factual basis to support the application of a 10-mile rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.626" offset="12801177">I would like to move on to the next issue, a second exception that Alaska raises, which is Alaska's challenge to the Special Master's determination that Dinkum Sands is not an island.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.434" offset="12848407">The Master concluded that Dinkum Sands is not an island under Article 10 of the convention because, in the Master's words, Dinkum Sands is frequently below mean high tide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.041" offset="12886859">Contrary to the contentions that Alaska makes in its brief, the Master was correct in concluding that Article 10 requires that an island must, at a minimum, be normally or usually above mean high tide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.919" offset="12938373">His interpretation is a sensible reading of the text, which defines an island as a naturally formed area of land surrounded by water which is above water at high tide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.045" offset="12978915">If Article 10 were read to impose no temporal requirements, then every sandbar that might occasionally peek above the water's surface could conceivably become an island.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.673" offset="13017367">The drafting history of Article 10 indicates that the drafters did not intend that construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3255.783" offset="13197821">You'll find a discussion of them in the Special Master's report where he discussed... discusses the question of horizontal permanence, namely the fact that Dinkum Sands seems to move about horizontally as well as up and down vertically, and that is the sole discussion we have of the mudlumps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.013" offset="13266784">The character of the mudlumps as best as we can describe it from the Court's past decisions is, these mudlumps appear, and they persist for years, and gradually erode away, so they do not have the character that we find here with Dinkum Sands, a feature that comes and goes within a matter of days or weeks or months, so we don't think that the mudlumps are an adequate comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.926" offset="13342435">In any event, the Court's discussions of the mudlumps have not indicated conclusively that the mudlumps are islands.</text>

            <text syncTime="3310.868" offset="13418190">There are also features that actually emerge from the mud themselves, form mounds, but then disappear as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.031" offset="13442849">The fact is, we just don't have a good record in this case on mudlumps, and it was not an important part of Alaska's case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.587" offset="13469076">Alaska's evidentiary case was really turned on the fact that an attempt to prove permanence with respect to Dinkum Sands, and as the Master explained, the Dinkum Sands formation is simply not permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.994" offset="13514634">The joint monitoring study that we did in 1981, in which we monitored this feature for one full year, showed that it was below mean high tide throughout that year.</text>
