            <text syncTime="424.459" offset="1845946">And it's our position that in this case no such uniquely Federal interest is present because this Court has defined such interest principally to involve the rights and duties of the United States and, as this Court said in O'Melveny, the FDIC is not the United States, and even if it were it, would be begging the issue because the FDIC is asserting claims in this case in its capacity as a receiver for the institution, standing in the shoes of the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.224" offset="1945003">In fact, the FDIC's position would not only require the application of Federal common law to cases where it's bringing the claims, it would require the application of Federal common law if the institution when solvent was bringing claims like this against its directors and officers or if a shareholder of a solvent institution was bringing a derivative action where the FDIC itself wouldn't be a party, where no United States entity would be a party, where no United States funds would be directly involved, and where not even the insurance fund would be directly involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.578" offset="5042498">In City of Milwaukee, one of the arguments that was made there was that there was a statutory section that dealt with citizen suits, and there was a provision in that section that said that any person was preserved the right to assert any remedy under State or common law, and that respondent in that case argued... petitioner in that case argued that that savings clause preserved Federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.231" offset="5153048">The Court rejected that argument and said at most... at most, that language only provided that that section dealing with citizen rights didn't have the effect of impacting a claim under common law, but that didn't mean that the comprehensive nature of the act as a whole didn't displace Federal common law, number 1, and number 2, it made the comment that the term common law as used in that savings clause was highly unlikely to have meant the specific narrowly construed Federal common law as opposed to the more generic State common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.155" offset="5296722">In this statutory provision, the savings clause doesn't even use the phrase, common law, and in our brief we point to a number of statutory provisions where when Congress wanted to save Federal common law it did so expressly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1716.597" offset="7014534">Your Honor, that can be explained by what the state of the law was at the time that Congress acted, and what Congress' purposes here were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.101" offset="7044523">This was emergency legislation, and Congress had a very simple purpose, which was to preempt State insulating statutes that could insulate officers and directors of financial institutions from liability to the FDIC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.826" offset="7091438">Now, at that time, while the majority of courts were applying the uniform ordinary care standard of Federal common law to officers and directors of federally chartered associations, some courts were applying State law to officers and directors of federally chartered associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.318" offset="7145460">Congress didn't try to sort out which was the right answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.103" offset="7156536">Congress just wanted to make sure, whatever a court might otherwise apply, the FDIC would always have a suit for gross negligence, so if a court would apply the State's law to a federally chartered association, Congress was telling them, well, apply that State's gross negligence standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.447" offset="7221946">However, if a court were to apply Federal common law the question really would never come up, because under Federal common law the standard is, and has for a long time, been a standard of ordinary care.</text>
