            <text syncTime="26.329" offset="248324">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="29.041" offset="259191">If the opinion and judgment of the Fifth Circuit in this case is allowed to stand, it would defeat the purpose that Congress enacted section 33(g) of the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act which was to protect an employer from increased compensation liability when a worker, or those claiming through him, settle a third party case for less than the compensation they would be entitled under the Longshore Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.147" offset="359606">It would also defeat the purpose for which Congress passed section 33(f) of the Longshore Act which is the give an employer credit to the extent of net third party recoveries received by a worker or those claiming through him.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.407" offset="420628">The facts of this case are that Jefferson Yates, between 1953 and 1967, worked as a ship fitter for Ingalls Shipyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.523" offset="457095">He left Ingalls in 1967 and worked several land-based jobs for other employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.696" offset="477784">14 years after he left Ingalls, he was diagnosed with asbestosis in March of 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.673" offset="509758">In April of 1981, he filed a claim against Ingalls for compensation and medical benefits under the Longshore Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.147" offset="539642">In May of 1981, his lawyers, who are the same lawyers that represent him in the compensation claim against Ingalls, filed a products liability suit in Federal court in Biloxi, Mississippi, seeking $6 million in actual and punitive damages against 23 asbestos manufacturers who he claimed made the asbestos to which he was exposed at Ingalls.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.983" offset="634936">Less than a year after his compensation claim was filed against Ingalls, Ingalls wrote the district director for the Sixth Compensation District and accepted his claim, voluntarily accepted his claim, under the Longshore Act and agreed to pay him medical benefits and tendered to him all benefits under the Longshore Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.596" offset="709438">Mr. Salloum, may I get you to... Salloum, may I get you to clarify for me how the employer is injured here?</text>
            <text syncTime="153.052" offset="755309">Now, I assume the employer could file suit against those third parties who were at fault for the employee's injuries to recover payments that you... the employer made... may have made.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard P. Salloum</label>
            <text syncTime="168.631" offset="817585">--If a Burnside action was filed separate and apart from the Longshore Act, the employer would be faced... if the employer sued the 23 asbestos manufacturers directly, the employer would be faced with certain common law defenses in the Burnside tort action, tort indemnity action, that the employer would not be faced in a direct action by the worker against those defendants under the Longshore Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.118" offset="923537">For example, if the employer filed a direct suit outside the Longshore Act under the Burnside tort indemnity theory, the defendants, the asbestos manufacturers, could assert certain contributory negligence features of coworkers of Mr. Yates which would serve to reduce Ingalls' recovery against those asbestos manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.734" offset="1017996">More important than that... and this Court made it clear in Bloomer... that an employer is entitled to receive back 100 percent of his compensation and medical benefits plus its attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.593" offset="1069405">That's provided by Congress under section 933 of the Longshore Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.857" offset="1086437">If an employer is required, because of some wrongful act of a worker, to file a separate Burnside tort indemnity lawsuit, the employer, in addition to being faced with common law defenses which would reduce its recovery in the Burnside action, would also be faced with having to bear its own attorney's fees and cost in the Burnside action which Congress has made it clear in section 933(e), as interpreted by this Court in Bloomer, that the employer has its inviolate right to have 100 percent of its compensation and medical benefits--</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="267.726" offset="1213914">So, you say you might not be made whole or as whole as you would be otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.841" offset="1238365">How about recovering monies that you pay to Mrs. Yates out of the post-death settlements?</text>
            <text syncTime="280.617" offset="1265532">Yes, ma'am.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.144" offset="1267622">Your Honor, Ingalls approved the post-death settlements.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.327" offset="1280370">And I think the classic example of that and why section 933(g) and section 933(f) are so important is that after Ingalls accepted Mr. Yates' claim in June of 1992 and agreed to pay him lifetime benefits under the Longshore Act, Mr. Yates and Mrs. Yates between 1982, when Ingalls accepted the claim, and 1986 when he died, entered into four settlements with asbestos manufacturers in that third party case which Mrs. Yates released her wrongful death claims for Mr. Yates during his lifetime.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.151" offset="1431671">A classic example of that is that those four settlements that were entered into between the time Ingalls accepted the claim and the time Mr. Yates died where she released her wrongful death claims totaled $30,000, which were much less--</text>
            <text syncTime="335.572" offset="1485379">--And that money is not recoverable by the employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.216" offset="1511919">But... that's exactly right, Your Honor, but the comparison that I'm making... and the reason why Congress felt it so important for an employer to have a right to consent to a third party settlement is that after Mr. Yates died, Mrs. Yates and her adult children... the next three settlements that they entered into after Mr. Yates died were for $105,000.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="364.400" offset="1600631">Well, you know, what you're basically saying is that the rule should kick in once the employer starts making payments, but that's not... it's not consistent with our holding in Estate of Cowart which said a person satisfies the prerequisites attached to the right and thus becomes a person entitled to compensation at the moment the right to recovery is vested, that is, at the time of the injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="404.995" offset="1763008">Well, I would think if we followed Cowart, we would have to say that Mrs. Yates was not entitled or qualified for a benefit until her husband's death.</text>

            <text syncTime="420.917" offset="1826747">What this Court, as I understand Cowart, said was the right of Mr. Cowart to recover compensation arose at the time of his injury, not at the time that the employer acknowledged liability under the act and not at the time that he was found entitled to adjudication under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.437" offset="1888814">This Court found in Cowart, as I understand Cowart, that his right to recover compensation arose when his injury arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.711" offset="1917862">And we are simply saying that that principle should hold true for those claiming through Mr. Cowart, that the right of the worker and the right of those claiming through the worker arising... arises at the time of the worker's injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.194" offset="2059864">I think what's... what the argument that the Director has posed in the courts below and I think the source of confusion is to take the vesting language out of Cowart, take it in vacuo, and ignore this Court's holding that Mr. Cowart became a person entitled to compensation at the time of his injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.586" offset="2129350">The fact that a wife of a worker may divorce, the fact that a wife of a worker may die before her husband becomes an irrelevant fact, if that happens, insofar as the employer is concerned because if the wife divorces or if the wife predeceases the husband, then her unapproved third party settlements for less than a compensation she would be entitled against the employer would not prejudice the employer because she would not have a claim against that employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1538.999" offset="6299015">We believe that the first question concerning the correct interpretation of section 33(g) is answered by the text and this Court's interpretation of that text in the Estate of Cowart case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.294" offset="6340184">The Court there held that under the plain language of section 33(g), the term person entitled to compensation means a person who satisfies the prerequisites attached to the right to Longshore Act compensation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1561.763" offset="6390130">Ms. Brinkmann, just last week we had a case involving the word employee in which the Government was arguing that the word employee sometimes in the statute can mean current employees and sometimes can mean current or past employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.406" offset="6472677">Now, why can't that principle be applied here, that in some provisions here, the person entitled to such compensation means the worker who was injured, but in other provisions where it makes eminent sense, it can mean him or a person who will later be entitled to compensation, not the person now, but the one who may later be entitled to it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1604.512" offset="6561075">Well, Your Honor, we believe that in this particular case, when you look at the structure of 33(g), there are many reasons why this cannot be interpreted to someone who has a potential entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.648" offset="6605692">First of all, there are many prerequisites that Mrs. Yates would have to meet in order to become eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.523" offset="6633173">And I think this is what Justice Stevens was getting at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.065" offset="6643309">This is one of the reasons that a person who's actually entitled to compensation is in a very different situation than Mrs. Yates for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.050" offset="6671207">In order to determine whether or not she would be entitled, not only would her husband have to die, she would have to outlive him, they would still have to be married at that time, and his death would have to be caused by the work-related injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2327.054" offset="9451263">I think that it would be reasonable for Congress to have distinguished between someone who already has a vested right to compensation, a known alternative remedy, vis-a-vis a person who only has a potential, perhaps entitlement at a later point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.272" offset="9500164">And weighing that against an employer in the first situation which also has a vested liability and a vested lien and entitlement to recoup, giving that employer a right to prevent a settlement or to participate in that settlement, as opposed to in the latter situation where the employer has no liability nor lien at that point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.085" offset="9579367">And we also think again because of the very different nature of the determinations of what compensation the person would be entitled to under the act, in the one instance, when the person is entitled, it's a reasonably, generally knowable calculation that may involve actuarial tables, but in the other situation, it involves much more than actuarial tables, a lot of eventualities about outliving another person that... expectancy of the duration of a marriage.</text>
