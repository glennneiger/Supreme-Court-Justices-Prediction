            <label>Mr. Carter G. Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="68.055" offset="423188">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="70.348" offset="432383">The issue in this case is whether the value of collateral that a Chapter 13 debtor proposes to retain and use should be determined by what the secured creditor could obtain if it foreclosed on that property and sold it, or by what the debtor would have to pay in order to acquire a comparable property.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.998" offset="498943">Our argument is that Section 506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code declares that the value of the property should vary, depending on whether it is proposed to be used or proposed to be disposed of, and that a hypothetical disclosure value is insufficient and ignores the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.607" offset="565399">Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred when it undervalued the secured interest of the Petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.143" offset="587550">This is a Chapter 13 case in which the Respondents proposed a plan that would permit them to keep a tractor trailer truck, which served as collateral for a debt owed to the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.317" offset="624226">At the time of the bankruptcy, the Petitioner was owed approximately... well, not approximately... was owed $41,171, and it had perfected a lien on the... under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.975" offset="662888">Petitioner sought, under Section 362, to lift the automatic stay and to repossess the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.478" offset="684830">Respondents objected, sought to keep the truck as necessary for their reorganization, and asked the court to value the truck at $28,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.055" offset="715132">They proposed to pay that amount, plus interest, and then to strip the lien from the... from the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.066" offset="735194">Both sides offered expert testimony on the value of the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.539" offset="749092">The Respondents' expert valued it at retail, at $42,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.881" offset="766437">Our expert valued it at $41,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.483" offset="776886">And the... the Respondents' expert also valued it at wholesale, at $31,875, which he got to by discounting by 25 percent the retail value.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.082" offset="823279">And all of these numbers were derived, essentially, from standard industry bluebooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.253" offset="839998">The Bankruptcy Court, the District Court and the Court of Appeals all concluded that, under these circumstances, they had to decide the question as a matter of law, which is the proper method of valuation, wholesale or retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.531" offset="881062">In doing so, they quite properly turned to Section 506(a) of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.163" offset="899557">Unfortunately, they misconstrued that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.265" offset="911991">506(a) has two sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.627" offset="925470">The first sentence tells you what you value.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.019" offset="934979">And as this Court held in Timbers, that phrase simply tells you that you value the creditor's collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.192" offset="955668">The first sentence says nothing about how you value the collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.085" offset="971237">The second sentence, which is reproduced on page 3 of the Petitioner's brief, says that the way you value collateral is that you... is that you value... shall be determined in light of the proposed disposition or use of such property.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.204" offset="1019720">Now, the Court is fond of observing, generally speaking, that--</text>

            <text syncTime="1284.383" offset="5288442">Sections 1325(a)(4) and 1129(a)(7), by contrast, say that an unsecured creditor is only guaranteed to get, in a reorganization, what he would get if the property had been liquidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.921" offset="5338597">So Congress clearly distinguished between the treatment of a security... secured claim and an unsecured claim in reorganizations.</text>
