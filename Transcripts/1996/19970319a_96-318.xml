            <text syncTime="75.721" offset="445172">The issue in this case is whether correctional officers who are employed by a private concern, who perform traditional and historical police power functions, and act under the color of law for 1983 purposes, should have the benefit of qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.271" offset="511419">Firstly, we would like to put forth the proposition that should this Court extend qualified immunity to correctional officers of this nature, that the floodgates will not open, and qualified immunity will not be willy nilly conferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.272" offset="575367">Firstly, there are thousands, literally... maybe hundreds of thousands of contractors who contract with the State of Tennessee, but only those who are found to act under the color of State law as defined by this Court's jurisprudence in Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison would be needful of qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.464" offset="652167">Secondly, only objectively reasonable actions on the part of these private actors would give rise to qualified immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.621" offset="1368758">What could he do with it?</text>
            <text syncTime="308.852" offset="1377744">He could try to prove his actions were objectively reasonable.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles R. Ray</label>
            <text syncTime="312.745" offset="1393313">That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and again, we may fail on that issue, Justice Ginsburg, but the issue before this Court and what we want decided is the fact that qualified immunity should be extended to these individuals who act under the color of State law for 1983 purposes, are subjected to suit on a day-by-day basis, and they perform traditional historical police powers that this Court has extended qualified immunity to their public counterparts in Navarette.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.434" offset="1516088">So we would submit that though we may ultimately not prevail on that question... that question is not before us here... the question is whether we get over the first hurdle, i.e.--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="355.582" stopTime="362.517">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="355.582" offset="1564676">The Sixth Circuit suggested that there might be another standard short of qualified immunity and said maybe good faith--</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles R. Ray</label>
            <text syncTime="362.517" offset="1592366">--The good faith defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.319" offset="1595605">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.117" offset="1598740">But the good faith defense, as you well know, Justice Ginsburg, still allows us to be subjected to the discovery process.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.564" offset="1628519">To discover the subjective mind set of my clients we go through what may be needless and extended litigation, expensive litigation, whereas if qualified immunity applies, of course, that ends the dispute at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.085" offset="1690691">So I would submit that the difference between a good faith defense and qualified immunity is quite, quite different, and the benefits that would be conferred not on my two petitioners, but on the citizens of the State of Tennessee, who would not have to bear the burden of litigating what may turn out to be a frivolous and vexatious lawsuit... which again this Court's jurisprudence from Harlow Ford has made it a consideration that the benefit you want to confer is not on the actors, but upon the citizens, who will benefit from not having their officers, who perform a traditional governmental function that utilizes a great deal of discretion, from being impeded, deterred, made timid by threat of litigation, and threatened with litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.906" offset="1881907">So we would submit that the question here again is whether you confer qualified immunity on officers who historically have and do provide a fundamental governmental function.</text>

            <text syncTime="2583.746" offset="10477342">It is the position of the United States that guards employed by a private corporation that is operating a prison pursuant to a contract with the State for the operation of that prison are not entitled to invoke qualified immunity under section 1983 solely by virtue of the fact that they are performing functions that are similar to those performed by a publicly employed guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.699" offset="10561143">However, as we explain in our brief, there are other circumstances not present in this case in which we do believe that private persons should be entitled to invoke immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.044" offset="10594475">Some of those have been referred to here, and some of them in fact have distinct common law antecedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.919" offset="10614015">There are... there's a common law recognition, for example, for private judicial activities in the area of arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.244" offset="10647243">There are common law antecedents for private citizens helping to find... to capture fleeing felons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.210" offset="10675141">There are common law antecedents for immunities for informants and other volunteers, such as volunteer fire companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.753" offset="10705339">Where... in situations where the Government cannot get the assistance of private persons in the performance of public functions, the law has long recognized immunities or defenses, and we think in those circumstances that correspondingly under 1983, or Bivens, when a person is acting under color of law, that there would be also a basis for doing that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2692.736" offset="10913274">I think there are really two questions, and that is whether the private corporation would be able to attract employees to serve as their guards, but then beyond that the question would be whether the State could accomplish the function of housing prisoners if that weren't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.636" offset="10972833">And we know from history that the States have operated prisons themselves and have been able to hire employees and attract employees and give them the security of their job.</text>

            <text syncTime="2740.869" offset="11105744">So if we're going back to history I would be quite interested as to how the States, again, have applied their common law tort law to people who suddenly privatize, take over State functions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3208.305" offset="12975484">They mostly argued this incentive thing, which we've been through, but if you go back into the history of these cases, I once thought that the reason this qualified immunity developed at all was the courts are focusing on a particular person who may not have insurance.</text>
