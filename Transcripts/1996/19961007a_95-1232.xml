            <text syncTime="113.355" offset="594616">First of all, what we have here is our local public utilities, which are making to a very significant extent nontariff sales.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.806" offset="708406">All they had to do during the period in question was to file the contract with the public utility commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.798" offset="728363">They in fact were allowed to do this, to engage in these unregulated sales, because they faced competition from these interstate marketers, and the public utilities--</text>

            <text syncTime="220.606" offset="1023651">It's not in the record, but it is a public order of the commission which said yes, you can engage in these kinds of sales, and these went on for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.000" offset="1053222">This is reflected, as I said, in the record at 229 to 230.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.753" offset="1068164">Then last June, this was formalized by statute for the first time, and the Ohio legislature said, you don't even have to bother to file these arrangements, these marketing arrangements, with the public utilities commission, you just go ahead and do it, and go on your merry way.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.716" offset="1452059">For example, in the Armco case, which is cited in the amicus brief of Columbia Gas, they had a situation where there was a discrimination against out-of-State wholesalers, and the theory was, well, we can treat in-State manufacturers/wholesalers differently, and the fact that you may combine competitive interstate business with some sort of local business doesn't justify discrimination under the Commerce Clause, and I understand the Court in that case to have directly addressed that question and to resolve it in favor of invalidating the discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="411.012" offset="1785277">People were going to these interstate marketers, and the local public utilities commissions wanted to find some way of enabling these companies to compete with these new marketers, and the way they figured out to allow them to compete in many instances was to say, okay, we'll allow you, too, to make unregulated sales and to act as marketers, and to compete with these interstate businesses so you don't lose the in-State business.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.597" offset="1875557">Now, there's a very important reason for that, of course.</text>

            <text syncTime="1452.431" offset="5950868">I'd like to start by addressing an argument that I began thinking about about 8:00 last night, and that is the nontariff argument that was just made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.297" offset="5986394">It's a very clever argument, because what it does is try to take on what I think is our best argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.243" offset="6010113">Our best argument is that the marketers are trying to have their cake and eat it too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.875" offset="6024637">They want the benefits of utility status, but not the burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.097" offset="6037594">And what General Motors is now saying is, they're saying, well, that's not actually true, the utilities are trying to do the same thing, and that's the reason they've relied on this 1987 order, and that's the reason they suggested that there actually were nontariff sales by utilities during the audit period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.097" offset="6105617">That's a great argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.899" offset="6112827">It's just not supported by the record or by the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.550" offset="6123380">It's not supported by the record because if you look at pages 229 and 230, it doesn't make any indication that there were actually nontariff sales during the audit period, 1987 through 1989.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.640" offset="6175730">There's nothing in the record at all that indicates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.551" offset="6183357">The notion that 20 percent of the sales to industrial consumers were nontariff sales is also unsupported.</text>

            <text syncTime="1544.652" offset="6319821">What the dual capacity doctrine says, and we've cited a case called American Transportation in our brief that deals with it, the dual capacity doctrine acknowledges that utilities can sometimes operate as utilities in a tariff setting, and then other times they can be operating like other businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.715" offset="6388053">In this instance, it would be a marketer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.875" offset="6392651">A good example is precisely the facts of American Transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.338" offset="6410518">That was a situation where a utility... it happened to be a motor carrier... decided to get into the business not just of delivering services, that is, transporting people or goods, they decided also to get into the business of actually manufacturing part of the trucks, and they thought they could do that and still get utility status with respect to certain tax benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.541" offset="6491393">They didn't get it, and the Ohio supreme court recognized that very doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.332" offset="6506544">There's a recent decision that we relied on in our brief called Carnegie, which makes the precise same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.286" offset="6530368">It was decided less than a year ago, and recognized that you can operate in one setting as a utility, and in another not as a utility.</text>

            <text syncTime="2067.283" offset="8410348">There's simply no way the marketer can guarantee, if he or she does not own pipeline, that natural gas is going to be supplied year-round on the coldest day of the winter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2084.306" offset="8478371">They can say as a matter of contract we'll do our best, but the reason they can't guarantee it is, someone else owns the pipeline, and that's the public utility, so that's a fundamental distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.371" offset="8522675">It's a fundamental distinction that will always be there, and I think as a matter of a State's police power, it's properly always going to be saying to itself, we've got to have a utility industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.559" offset="8563426">It might be a different utility industry than we had 20, 30 years ago, but the reason we need a utility industry, the reason we can't keep going down this deregulation road, is people die if they don't have heat in winter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2237.045" offset="9089323">The reason they're irreconcilable is number 1, because one involves the sale of a naked commodity, the other is a commodity in the service, so they're just, to begin with, different transactions, different in a way that would be true of other sales services versus just a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.933" offset="9144912">The other difference is, of course, the rate control and the duty you have to the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="2910.405" offset="11782757">--Oh, Your Honor, that's precisely... it's ironic why we're here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.671" offset="11803864">The reason we're here is because back in 1982 some marketers came to Ohio and said, listen, we'd like to sell natural gas, but we'd like to do it in a deregulated capacity, and Ohio at that point had the choice to say, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.137" offset="11853705">You're a utility, or you're not a utility, and we could still do that under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.443" offset="11874917">But Ohio chose not to, and what Ohio chose to do was to say, well, we think deregulated gas is a good thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.036" offset="11897277">It's particularly good for industrial consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.467" offset="11907099">We're just... the only thing we're going to condition it on is that there's a regulatory line, and if you're on the deregulated side you get the benefits and burdens of it, if you're on the regulated side you get the benefits and burdens as well, but you can't pick and choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.866" offset="11956628">Once you're one you have to comply with all of those rules and all of those laws.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jeffrey S. Sutton</label>
            <text syncTime="2964.872" offset="12000722">Oh, yes, absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.333" offset="12002499">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.642" offset="12007723">They of course would ultimately probably have to get transportation equipment as well, right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.867" offset="12024651">This gets back to the point we were talking about earlier, that Ohio... the Ohio Public Utilities Commission, it's elected officials, can't be certain that a company will be able to provide natural gas whenever it is needed, however cold, unless that company owns transportation equipment, so I think fundamentally... I mean, I don't know of an Ohio opinion that says that, but I think as a practical matter, they probably would end up saying that very point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3000.846" offset="12144605">Your Honor, I'd like to very briefly address the congressional authority argument that we have also raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.412" offset="12178877">Let me tell you why it's a difficult argument, but why I think we can still make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.744" offset="12192148">It's a difficult argument because back in 1938 when the Natural Gas Act was passed, and again when it was amended in 1953, I don't think it was in any Congressman or-woman's mind that they needed to pass this law to constitutionalize the status of utilities, so that's a problem I had.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.023" offset="12257245">It simply just wasn't something they were after.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.946" offset="12264977">They were trying to fill a regulatory void with respect to interstate transportation of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.620" offset="12287651">But that said, the language does the trick.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.331" offset="12298518">The language indicates that there's a dichotomy between all retail sales on the one hand and all wholesale sales on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.455" offset="12327044">In this instance, that's all we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.808" offset="12336448">All we have are retail transactions, and under section 1(b) and (c) of the act, which is codified at 15 U.S.C. 717b and c, that's precisely what Ohio's allowed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.975" offset="12381065">Now, General Motors has argued that's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.047" offset="12393395">The enabling language simply gives you authority to regulate rates, services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.640" offset="12415756">It doesn't use the magic words, tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.890" offset="12424742">We don't think Congress had to use the magic words, tax, in order to bless this form of transaction, and the reason is straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.568" offset="12463403">Number 1, the text of the Commerce Clause itself, of course, uses the word regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.160" offset="12481793">It says nothing about tax, and we wouldn't be here if the word regulate in the Constitution didn't cover discriminatory taxes, so that's a starting point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.365" offset="12514603">A second point is a matter of common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.468" offset="12523067">As this Court has indicated, is the word regulate does cover tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.350" offset="12534561">Indeed, in General Motors' own opening brief at page 28, and again in one of their amicus briefs, at page 13 of the Chamber of Commerce brief, they made that very point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.536" offset="12571341">The Chamber of Commerce said, what's going on here is Ohio is using taxes as a back-door way to regulate marketers, so I think as a matter of common understanding, everyone understands the broad term regulate to cover taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.385" offset="12626721">There's another reason why this is legitimate, under congressional blessing, and that's the fact that what Ohio has done to all of the marketers... and I think this is important for the Commerce Clause issue as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.141" offset="12669771">What Ohio has done is treated the marketers like all other businesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3140.857" offset="12704566">Just very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Sutton suggests that he's not sure, but maybe these unregulated sales by public utilities would not be taxed, would not be exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.498" offset="12771126">There's no basis for that in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.631" offset="12783664">The statute does not distinguish between regulated and unregulated sales by public utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.634" offset="12803726">All public utility sales are exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.345" offset="12814593">All natural gas sales are exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.125" offset="12821699">And while we think the interpretation of the Carnegie case that they supply is not correct, if that interpretation is correct, what they're saying is, anybody who can claim the status of public utility can come into any part of the State and make exempt sales as a gas marketer, whereas the out-of-State companies are never going to get the exemption if they can't claim that public utility status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.181" offset="12913859">The congressional policy here, we suggest, is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.944" offset="12932980">It's in favor of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.717" offset="12940086">It's in favor of allowing everybody to compete on an equal footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.817" offset="12952415">We respectfully suggest that that policy leads to the same conclusion that this Court's Commerce Clause precedents do, and that is the discrimination here is not acceptable.</text>
