Rutherford, which was another case involving the same deputy, and what the Ohio court was confronted with, and what gave rise to this significant issue, was that the officer in that case, Deputy Newsome, who is the same officer in this case, indicated that in the year Mr. Robinette was stopped he had obtained consent searches in 786 cases.</text>
