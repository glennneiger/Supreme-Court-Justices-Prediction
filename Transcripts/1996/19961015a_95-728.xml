            <text syncTime="69.213" offset="416840">This Court's doctrine of prosecution history, or file wrapper estoppel has always said, in a way unaffected by Graver Tank, that there should be no second-guessing of the reason for the examiner's demand for a limit once the patentee has accepted that demand and bypassed the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.025" offset="492073">That principle states a critical limit on any otherwise available doctrine of equivalents, and itself requires reversal here.</text>

            <text syncTime="105.198" offset="560827">Your... sort of your fallback position is that the doctrine not to apply only in a case in which the so-called point of equivalence was within the claim that was actually made, but which for some reason would not have been enforceable, the claim was, for whatever reason, too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.752" offset="654973">And yet, if I understand you correctly, and that's what your position would be, then the person who claims too much, but invalidly, is in a better position than the person who, before the patent examiner, gives up more than he has to, because the Patent Office indicates that without such a concession they won't give their approval, and doesn't that present a sort of a anomalous position that the person who goes the whole hog and more is going to end up in a better position than the individual who concedes too much simply to get the patent through.</text>

            <text syncTime="168.870" offset="815469">Well, I think that the fundamental point is that it's in the PTO that the process of negotiating about proper breadth can and does take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.607" offset="862385">If someone comes in, as applicants have an inherent incentive to do, and seek broader coverage because it gives them greater rights and more opportunity to exclude the world from something, then a process takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.727" offset="918914">In most cases the examiner will reject an initial application, and there is a discussion about why.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.482" offset="945872">Here, there were, I think, two or three rejections of the initial application, basically because of the obviousness of the filtering of these dyes.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.077" offset="988295">But then, as I think is indicated at pages 103 and 107 of the Joint Appendix, as Hilton Davis' description of its interview with the examiner shows, Hilton Davis went into the examiner and the examiner said, okay, now I'm persuaded that if your pH is above 9, it won't be obvious anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.860" offset="1067394">But it also... he also said, make sure the pH is above 6, and he pointed specifically to the specification, the part of the long disclosure that says, here's where we say what we know works.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.990" offset="1119952">So it is, in fact, apparent in this record why the examiner said 6 as the lower limit, and the Federal circuit just missed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.055" offset="1156210">Now, it I think would generally be true that a patentee... I'm not sure I understood exactly the--</text>

            <text syncTime="261.839" offset="1187348">Well, I think it's still the case... accepting everything you say, as I understand your position, it's still the case that when the PTO is perhaps asleep at the switch and it let's a claim through which in fact is broader than would ultimately prevail, that is the one case in which in your fallback position the doctrine of substantial equivalents would be recognized, is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="1098.728" offset="4534888">Well, I don't think that a departure from it needs to take place, depending on how broadly one reads it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.644" offset="4562578">Graver is written, I think, in such a way as to focus on a host of facts that on the equities there seem to make a compelling case for finding infringement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1130.481" offset="4661947">Now, as for a broader reading, our basic position is that a broader reading is inappropriate, because it would fundamentally repudiate the long line of authority in which this Court said the claims define the reliable boundaries of the patent monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.711" offset="4730806">And if it's an undisclosed equivalent, an undisclosed extension of the patent, something that a reader couldn't determine, only an experimenter could determine, then it runs smack into the very notion of invention that this Court was very explicit about in the U.S. Industrial Chemicals case, which we discussed in our reply brief and this Court relied on several times in Markman, where the Court said, it doesn't matter if all the scientists agree that a small change would not make a scientific difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="1319.636" offset="5418558">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.014" offset="5468086">In last April's decision in Markman v. Westview, this Court recognized that the scope of protection afforded by a patent grant is defined by the claim or claims, yet in the Graver Tank decision in 1950 the Court rightly noted that outright duplication of a patented invention is rare, so the difficulty that the courts have faced over the years is how to protect the substance of the claims against misappropriation through trivial or colorable or insubstantial substitutions, however you want to call them, without depriving the public of the notice to which it's entitled, and without enlarging the claims in the course of litigation, that is the dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.461" offset="5697859">And it... I think it's helpful also to think of it in terms of the statutory policies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1450.803" offset="5943201">And in light of Markman, which has now held that it is exclusively within the province of the Court to interpret patent claims so as to define, so as to define the patentee's rights against literal infringement, it really would be incongruous to adopt a different rule to define the rights against nonliteral infringement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1930.594" offset="7862365">I'd like to respond first to Mr. Taranto's argument that we cannot invoke the doctrine of equivalents in this case because the inventors intentionally surrendered pH's below 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.983" offset="7923910">I think if we look at the record in this case we find one peculiarity, although I don't think this Court has spoken on the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.839" offset="7963303">The Federal circuit has found that this doctrine of prosecution history estoppel, the intentional surrender of claim coverage, is a question of law, normally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.256" offset="8001023">In this case, however, the parties agreed to submit that question to the jury, and an instruction was given to the jury on prosecution history estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.152" offset="8044596">It appears on page 60 of the Joint Appendix, and it essentially asks the jury to consider the reasons why surrender was made, if surrender were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.960" offset="8083884">The finding of fact to be implied from the jury's verdict of infringement is that there was no such surrender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.276" offset="8121082">That fact having been established by the jury, and now having been reviewed by the trial court in the posttrial motions and by the Federal circuit, I suggest creates a very limited scope of review.</text>
