            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="82166">I have the opinions of the Court to announce in three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.035" offset="102228">The first of them is No. 95-1858, Vacco against Quill.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.403" offset="123753">In New York, as in most states, it is a crime to assist a suicide but patients are allowed to refuse unwanted medical treatment even if that treatment is necessary to save their lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.906" offset="165758">The question presented in this case is whether this distinction is so irrational that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.842" offset="205464">The respondents here are New York doctors and they argue that refusing life-sustaining medical treatment is really the same thing as physician-assisted suicide and so it does violate Equal Protection Clause to permit one but not the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.628" offset="264605">The District Court rejected this argument but the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.401" offset="299714">Under the Equal Protection Clause, states must treat like cases alike but they treat unlike cases accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.559" offset="336390">That is the proposition which we have followed for a long time and follow here and we therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.242" offset="375051">Respondents, as I have said, contented some terminally ill people, those who are on life support treatments system, that are treated differently from those who are not because the former may hasten death by ending treatment but the later may not hasten death through a physician assisted suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.822" offset="441402">This argument assumes though that ending life-saving treatment is the same thing as assisted suicide and we reject this assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.314" offset="475361">The distinction between assisting suicide and ending life-sustaining treatment is widely recognized and endorsed in the medical profession and in our legal tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.590" offset="512455">In our opinion, we focused primarily on two important differences between the two practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.112" offset="534607">First, a patient who commits physician-assisted suicide is killed by the lethal drug provided by the doctor but when a patient refuses life-sustaining medical treatment, he dies from his underlying disease or condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.337" offset="587479">Second, a physician who honors a patient’s request to end unwanted treatment does not necessarily intend that the patient dies.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.737" offset="617049">He may only intend to respect his patient’s wishes and to seek doing futile or degrading things to the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.905" offset="641709">On the other hand, a doctor who assists a suicide must necessarily intend primarily that the patient be made dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.043" offset="670235">The law has long distinguished between actions taken because of a give result from actions taken in spite of their intended but unforeseen consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.605" offset="712553">It is therefore, not surprising that many courts including this Court in our recent Cruzan opinion, and the overwhelming majority of legislators have drawn a clear line between assisting suicide and ending unwanted treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.251" offset="771067">We therefore reject respondent’s claim that the distinction between the two is irrational or arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.892" offset="801683">Logic and contemporary practice supports New York’s judgment that the two acts are different and the Constitution permits New York to treat them differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.242" offset="839090">Justice O’Connor has filed a concurring opinion which Justices Ginsburg and Breyer joined in part; Justices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg and Breyer have filed opinions concurring in the judgment.</text>
