            <label>Mr. James S. Liebman</label>
            <text syncTime="8.637" offset="176226">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.224" offset="190541">The Court granted review of a single issue, whether the court of appeals properly denied Aaron Lindh's 1992 habeas petition based on a 1996 amendment to 28 U.S.C. section 2254(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="25.131" offset="242263">The court below interpreted that amendment to require it to leave intact State court decisions believed to be wrong under the Constitution as long as they are not "gravely wrong".</text>
            <text syncTime="34.804" offset="280924">Mr. Lindh ardently opposes that interpretation, but accept it here in addressing the different issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.410" offset="307360">I'll make two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.093" offset="314048">First, because the statute's express delineation of the pending cases to which new habeas provisions shall apply omits Mr. Lindh's pending case, the statute makes itself inapplicable here, and thus disposes of the case under Landgraf's Step 1, and also, therefore, under its clear congressional intent, Step 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.673" offset="392415">Second, and alternatively, the court of appeals interpretation of section 2254(d) to attach a new legal consequence, the denial of relief, to preenactment events that previously had given Lindh an unconditional right to relief from unconstitutional custody bars section 2254(d)'s application under Landgraf's Step 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.586" offset="480082">In Landgraf in 1994, the Court repeatedly urged Congress to exercise responsibility for fundamental policy judgments concerning the temporal reach of statutes, so Landgraf held that where Congress' intent as to the temporal reach is clear, its statute-specific policy judgments will govern, but that otherwise the courts will follow the timeless and universal rule against applying new laws to have retroactive effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.237" offset="582691">That is, against attaching to preenactment events what a court finds to be a new legal consequence.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>

            <text syncTime="119.426" offset="619367">Your Honor, I don't think that there is an exception under Step 2 per se for jurisdictional rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.978" offset="641623">What the Court said was that jurisdiction oftentimes is the kind of change that does not attach new legal consequences to preenactment events.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.267" offset="682792">The reason is that in all of the court's jurisdictional retroactivity cases where Congress didn't specify the outcome it wanted, there was an alternative forum that remained, and so it wasn't a question of whether you've got to enforce your rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.123" offset="726155">It was simply a question of which forum you would be allowed to enforce your rights in.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.693" offset="748516">This case is very different, because here there is no alternative remedy.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="191.550" offset="907863">Mr. Liebman, you spoke in answering the Chief Justice's question a moment ago about there being no alternative forum here, so that the jurisdictional analysis was inapposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.972" offset="941613">Why wasn't there an alternative forum simply in the direct method of appeal in the first instance?</text>

            <label>Mr. James S. Liebman</label>
            <text syncTime="208.059" offset="973901">--There are three answers to that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.494" offset="983618">First of all, the principle that I want to stand on is that there is no remaining effective and substantial alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.732" offset="1008591">That's the language from the Crane v. Halo case.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.934" offset="1017473">There are three reasons, therefore, why the State process does not provide an alternative and significant or satisfactory remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.955" offset="1057493">The first one is that the... ever since this Court's case in 1886 in Ex parte Royale the understanding has been that the violation is the leaving intact, the emplacement and leaving intact of custody by the entire State judicial system as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.134" offset="1126247">And so you cannot make what is part of the violation into a sufficient remedy for the violation, because it is as if in the Landgraf case someone were to say to Mrs. Landgraf that because she had tried to get relief from her employer and the employer had thought about it and said you weren't discriminated against, you wouldn't make that a sufficient remedy, and it's the same thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.747" offset="1204719">Part of the violation includes the entire State court process leading to incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.299" offset="1226871">Secondly, to the extent that the direct appeal process provides an alternative remedy, it is a remedy by certiorari to this Court at the end of that direct review process, a remedy that Mr. Lindh was lulled into passing up, because at the time it was neither his last nor his best option available for plenary Federal review.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="293.980" stopTime="306.621">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="293.980" offset="1317568">Well, that may go to his judgment, and it may have been a perfectly sensible judgment to make at the time, but it doesn't go to the question whether there is an alternative to the particular kind of review sought, which I assume is a question about the system rather than about his particular judgment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_s_liebman" startTime="306.621" stopTime="352.733">
            <label>Mr. James S. Liebman</label>
            <text syncTime="306.621" offset="1368141">Well, let me give the third reason, Your Honor, because I think it speaks directly to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.073" offset="1381933">In the Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm case in 1995, the Court spoke about a number of congressional statutes that take away the res judicata defense and allow, for example, soldiers on duty to reopen litigation that was concluded against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.582" offset="1444000">Now, let's assume that Congress decided to change that statute and to say, no, there is going to be a res judicata defense, but it's only going to be a res judicata defense insofar as the judgment that you're challenging was gravely wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.973" offset="1493633">Now, under this Court's cases it is very clear that this Court would not take away a soldier's existing and accrued right of action under this statute as it existed under a new establishment of a defense that was established--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="352.733" stopTime="421.043">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="352.733" offset="1552670">Well, assuming that to be true, you're also assuming an analogy which may well be sound, but I guess it's not self-evidently sound, and that is that the cause of action that you would be speaking of in your example is the same... is a cause of action in the same sense that there is a cause of action in habeas, and habeas is kind of a mongrelized cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.598" offset="1648069">Yes, it is a means of coming into court under a specific Federal statute, but it's also in fact a means of review for error as an alternative to another means of review for error.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.274" offset="1706792">When somebody in direct appeal, for example, takes an appeal, we don't think of that person as having a cause of action to appeal, and so I suppose the so-called habeas cause of action is in that sense a different kind of cause of action from the one that you're referring to in your example, and I guess my question is, why as a matter of categorization or characterization should we refer to the habeas remedy as involving a cause of action in that classic sense.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_s_liebman" startTime="421.043" stopTime="470.124">
            <label>Mr. James S. Liebman</label>
            <text syncTime="421.043" offset="1825911">--Well, Your Honor, first of all, I'm not sure it makes a difference whether you see this as a new element of the cause of action, or the establishment of a new defense, or as the dramatic changing of the standard of review, if you want to think of it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.768" offset="1880768">Now, I think that it is much more appropriate to look at the post-enactment statute as one creating a new standard of review, but it does set up a chain of courts and tells... in 2254(d) it says, look back to the State court and review that State court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.194" offset="1938446">The statute never before had said that, and so under the statute as it previously existed, the rights that were given and accrued under the previous statute, there wasn't a standard of review kind of approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.502" offset="1979720">But even, Your Honor, if it was a new standard of review, the lower court cases are unanimous on the question that the imposition of a new standard of review is like the imposition of a--</text>

            <text syncTime="472.243" offset="2030711">I mean, that alters... that alters the substantive right.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.762" offset="2044712">This is just the elimination of review that used to be available and is not now available.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.165" offset="2066342">Let's say, what Congress did when it eliminated much of our mandatory jurisdiction and provided for recourse to this Court only by certiorari, it's your position, I gather, that Congress could not render that action applicable to causes of action that arose before the statute was passed?</text>

            <text syncTime="598.237" offset="2534665">Is it the kind of thing that changes the legal... the law that applies in the two sets of courts?</text>
            <text syncTime="604.022" offset="2557757">And in those cases this Court has consistently said, using what is in effect a new legal consequences analysis, it's saying, are there new legal consequences attached to the forum that you pick?</text>
            <text syncTime="614.997" offset="2601643">Here it's the new legal consequence attached to a temporal kind of criteria, but the analysis there makes very clear that standards of review are treated as substantive, as defining the substantive rights, and as changing the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="646.551" offset="2727866">I'm simply trying to point out that the Court has recognized, including in the Gasperini case, that you get new law, a new set of legal outcomes.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.489" offset="2767677">In a sense, what you... what the law had promised you in the state courts, if it instead is brought in the Federal courts you get something different, and it is exactly that that I'm pointing... that I'm referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.214" offset="2814593">In answer to Justice Scalia's point, I want to go back to those very statutes that you refer to, a series of statutes running from 1875 to 1891, the Everetts act, and through the judges' bill in 1925, and up through 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.455" offset="2867465">In all of those statutes where Congress switched this Court's preexisting appeal, or writ of error jurisdiction to a certiorari jurisdiction, in each one of those it both... it did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.579" offset="2916053">First of all, it said any case in the Supreme Court at the time the statute was passed will proceed under the prior statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.816" offset="2940921">Secondly, it said that any case that had reached a final judgment... that is, in which there was an accrued and existing right to an appeal or writ of error at the time the new statute came into effect would be given a long period of time, often 6, 7, 8 months, to get into the Supreme Court under the old law, so that you'd have your appeal or your writ of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.746" offset="3032663">So even Congress seems to understand that even if it is a chain of courts connected with one kind of review versus another, that if you had an accrued, an existing right to the review because you had a final judgment against you, that you had--</text>

            <text syncTime="2591.774" offset="10508804">One way to look at that, I think, is to say if it's jurisdictional, if it goes primarily to what the Court does, not the parties, if it's procedural, as it is here, if it's a secondary layer of conduct as it is here, adjudication is secondary as opposed to primary conduct, if it's one of those things, then you simply don't do the Landgraf analysis.</text>
