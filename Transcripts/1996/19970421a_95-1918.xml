            <text syncTime="956.362" offset="3962559">The principle underlying the exception to the Tax Injunction Act that was recognized in Department of Employment was described by this Court in 1960 in Federal Power Commission v. Tuscarora Indian Nation as,</text>
            <text syncTime="973.652" offset="4031732">"General statutes imposing restrictions do not apply to the Government itself without a clear expression to that effect. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1005.117" offset="4157642">While the term, instrumentality is often used on the merits of questions of tax immunity, because obviously the Government itself cannot be taxed, and the issue is about whether an instrumentality is immune from tax, the expression that the Court used when it addressed this closely analogous question in NLRB v. Nash-Finch under section 2283 of title 28, was the United States and its agencies, or in one instance it used the term, public authority.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Hanson</label>
            <text syncTime="1522.947" offset="6228943">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.780" offset="6248274">I'd like to answer Justice Scalia's question as to what standards ought to apply in determining application of the Tax Injunction act, application of sovereign immunity concepts, application of tax immunity concepts, but I think it really has two pieces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.418" offset="6306788">One is that the same standard should apply in determining whether or not an entity is a Federal instrumentality, and the Court's most recent discussion of that is in U.S. v. New Mexico, where they talked about an entity being so closely connected to the Government that it cannot be viewed as a separate party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.451" offset="6374915">Now, beyond that, and I think the Court said this in Federal Land Bank v. Priddy, you then get to the question of whether... and let me back up just a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.366" offset="6406576">In Federal Land Bank v. Priddy the Court, talking about a Federal Land Bank, which is one of the institutions of the system, said that it would partake of the sovereign immunity of the United States absent a waiver by Congress, and there was sue-and-be-sued language in the statutes, therefore the Court concluded that sovereign immunity to some extent had been waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.730" offset="6492048">The issue in that case involved execution of a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.722" offset="6504065">The result which you get in a Tax Injunction Act case, an immunity case, a sovereign immunity case, a case involving punitive damages, and a case involving estoppel, all of which are issues which have been addressed by this Court or the lower courts, then turns on what has Congress done?</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.826" offset="6584417">And it becomes a question of, you know they're a Federal instrumentality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.920" offset="6604793">You know they partake of the sovereignty of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.344" offset="6614510">Now, what does the governing statute tell you about what Congress has done in terms of waiver of tax immunity, waiver of sovereign immunity?</text>

            <text syncTime="1690.112" offset="6897573">Now, they say that in the face of a preamble which explains exactly what they do, in the face of being repeatedly designated... and frankly for current institutions this is a unique designation... Federal instrumentalities, and in face of a number of decisions by this Court involving various farm credit system entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.305" offset="6970403">But I think the other thing they say we need to... I would like to discuss a bit further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.450" offset="6990987">They say that these entities exist to make profits for their members, and that simply misconceives the nature of the farm credit system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.335" offset="7022439">When the Federal Land Banks were created back in 1916, Congress referred to the farm credit system as a bridge between farmers and the credit markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.632" offset="7071653">They said the Federal Government cannot provide a mechanism to get adequate credit to farmers, that the commercial banking institutions cannot provide a mechanism to get adequate credit to farmers, so what we will do is, we will provide a federally supported mechanism, and that's all the modern farm credit system does.</text>

            <text syncTime="2104.247" offset="8554155">But the system is probably fairly stated unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.653" offset="8587800">It was formed because there was a congressional determination that this is how the congressional purpose could be accomplished, that the Federal Government can't do it because the farm economy is too complex, that you can't run the system from Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.773" offset="8644225">The legislative history on the '33 act explains that a centralized Federal funding program during the early stages of the Depression had managed to lose some $40 million and had not accomplished its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.971" offset="8689051">They said, we can't do this, so what we will do is we will set up a farmer-supported system, or a federally supported system, and we will engage the farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.489" offset="8731056">Now, that doesn't mean that they get into this system to make a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.362" offset="8746625">It means that if a farmer wants to borrow money from the system, he has to buy stock, and it's mandatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="2162.660" offset="8787794">It is a cost of entry, in effect, but it was determined that that way the farmer would be interested in the success of the associations, the success of the system as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.615" offset="8823634">So the role of the farmer reflects Congress' considered decision that this makes sense as a means of an effective system for delivery of credit, but you know, it's a closed system, too, except for periodic Government investment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3159.493" offset="12775124">And I observe that James v. Dravo, which I find kind of interesting as sort of a landmark Federal instrumentality case, was brought in Federal court by private attorneys on behalf of the contractor, and granted it was, I'm sure, litigation that started before the Tax Exemption Act was adopted, but there's not even a comment about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3231.869" offset="13064561">First of all, their argument that they are a Federal instrumentality certainly does not imply that that is the case for all purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3246.410" offset="13122762">--There is a specific statute, a specific taxation statute that relates to the Federal credit unions that gives them a very broad immunity from taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.398" offset="13170723">In fact, that statute is very similar in wording and in language to the statute that the PCA's had prior to the amendment, and at the time that they were Government-owned, so Federal credit unions may be distinguished in that respect in that their tax immunity is very clear by statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.274" offset="13266226">If the statute were the same, where the... well, first of all I need to answer that in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.139" offset="13285661">If the statute were exactly the same, then we would make the argument that because the PCA's are now privately owned, that they are not entitled to that exemption because the last sentence of that original statute provided that at the time they became privately owned the broad exemption was waived, so my answer would be they would still have essentially the same immunity that they do today because they are privately owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.477" offset="13399033">In another respect there are many other Federal instrumentalities other than production credit associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.831" offset="13432470">For example, the other Government-sponsored enterprises like Ginnie Mae, Fanny Mae, Freddie Mac, and all of those entities are designated by statute as Federal instrumentalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.589" offset="13479490">If you look at the language of the enacting statutes where Federal... where production credit associations are designated instrumentalities, which is printed on the respondent's brief on page Roman i, first of all it says each production credit association shall continue as a federally chartered instrumentality of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.797" offset="13580323">This is quoting directly from 12 U.S.C. section 2071(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.351" offset="13598504">It is my contention that this designation simply implies that Congress has the power to create or to allow these farmers to band together and to charter these institutions, because again, on the same page at 12 U.S.C. section 2071 (b)(7), there's the same instrumentality language relating to the fact that PCA's are federally chartered body corporate and an instrumentality of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.421" offset="13722847">Then, in their statute, the PCA statute relating to their taxation, which is printed in the petitioner's brief on page 2, we again see the instrumentality language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.951" offset="13780943">Quoting from 2077, each production credit association and its obligations are instrumentalities of the United States and as such, going on with the language of the exemption from tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.210" offset="13841965">It is my contention that that language is there for a specific purpose, in the first instance to show that Congress has power to create these institutions, and in the second to show that Congress has the power to immunize them to the limited degree that they did from tax, which leads into the argument on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.784" offset="13928274">The respondents' attempt to apply the doctrine of McCulloch to this case, there is a very specific reason why the doctrine of McCulloch does not apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.273" offset="13978220">There was no tax exemption statute in McCulloch which led the Court to construe the implied immunity.</text>
