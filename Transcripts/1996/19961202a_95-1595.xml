            <text syncTime="12.329" offset="188117">This case concerns the constitutionality of section 2... of the amended version of section 207 of the Indian Land Consolidation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.246" offset="219882">The unamended version of this statute was before this Court almost 10 years ago in Hodel v. Irving, and the Court found it unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.829" offset="250184">Our submission is that the amended statute remedies the flaws that this Court found in the original version of the statute, and the amended statute is therefore constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.336" offset="288218">Now, the purpose... the statute arose as a response to what this Court has characterized in Hodel as the extraordinary problem of extreme fractionation of Indian trust lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.983" offset="334820">Such extreme fractionation when many people combine to own undivided interests in single parcels of land makes productive use of the land very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.291" offset="372019">If a given parcel has a large number, sometimes in the hundreds of different owners, it's very hard for anyone to take initiative to see to it that the parcel is put to a productive economic use.</text>

            <text syncTime="130.496" offset="660829">The Court held in Hodel that there was a taking because it completely and totally eliminated all rights of descent and devise for the land and, as the Court said twice in its opinion, even when permitting descent or devise would result in a consolidation of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.527" offset="732926">In this case none of the... none of the interest that they had passed effectively through the will would have resulted in such a consolidation of the land and, indeed, in Hodel v. Irving when the Court... in one of the places where the Court made that comment it put a Cf cite specifically to the amended version of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.449" offset="800636">Now, the amended version of the statute in our view remedies the flaws in the original statue in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.263" offset="827908">In the first place, in connection with the economic impact of the statute, the amended... the original statute required that land be escheated if in the 1 year prior to the decedent's death it had not earned more than $100, and if the interest involved was less than 2 percent.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.915" offset="906484">Subsection (a) of 207 says if the land is incapable of earning $100 in any one of the 5 years from the date of decedent's death, and where the factional interest has earned its owner less than $100 in any one of the 5 years before the decedent's death there's a rebuttable presumption--</text>

            <text syncTime="257.399" offset="1168440">In the first place, that issue isn't presented by this case because no one has claimed that our reading of the statute in this case was wrong, but more importantly, the kinds of lands that we're generally dealing with here are lands that are useful primarily for grazing or for mineral leasing, and as a general matter it doesn't really make... it will be a very small number of cases where which year you're looking at is going to be an important factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="451.571" offset="1945113">What Congress did was, it remedied the first problem primarily by talking about capable of earning, rather than just what it had in fact earned, and in addition by setting up this 5-year window rather than just 1 year before the decedent's death, and it dealt with the second problem by permitting devise in precisely those cases where the devise would result in consolidation of the property.</text>
