            <text syncTime="12.629" offset="194505">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.441" offset="205789">This case involves the construction of Section 701(b) of Title VII, which defines the term 15 or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year, and any... any agent of such person.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.728" offset="306936">We seek review of the holding of the Seventh Circuit in this case, which was that the words, "for each working day", can only be construed to have meaning under a test that counts employees only on the days that they are present at work or on the days that they are on paid leave, except for salaried employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.351" offset="385407">And for salaried employees, the Seventh Circuit said it makes no difference where they are, what they're doing or how they're paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.015" offset="412052">We believe that this is wrong for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.738" offset="426890">First of all, because the plain text of the statute focuses on the orgoing employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.113" offset="448415">Second of all, because the suggestion of the Seventh Circuit and all the other courts which have considered the... the meaning of the phrase, "for each working day", they are wrong when they say that only this day-by-day method gives that phrase meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.633" offset="506511">And, thirdly, because if the text is ambiguous... and there is some suggestion, just because of the stark split in the courts on this, that perhaps the statute is ambiguous... that the legislative history and the purpose intent of Congress, the policy underlying Title VII, and the EEOC's own administrative interpretation of the... of the statute and those words favor the payroll method--</text>

            <text syncTime="128.029" offset="656140">Under the Seventh Circuit's test, a part-time employee, for example, who works 4 days out of the week, but not the fifth day... assuming a Monday to Friday workweek... would not be counted on a Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.958" offset="703788">With this case, we have assumed ourselves past the problem of defining the term "workday" or "workweek", and we've basically focused on the question of whether or not there is a necessity to focus on whether or not someone's at work or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1030.641" offset="4266576">Or consider the example that this very Court considered in the Skidmore case, which was previously mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.914" offset="4291654">In Skidmore, there was a factory worker who was required, on some of his days off, to remain on or near the factory, on call, unpaid, in order to be available in the event of a fire emergency.</text>
