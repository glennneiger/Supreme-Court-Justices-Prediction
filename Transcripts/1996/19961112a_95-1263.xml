            <text syncTime="13.913" offset="185300">The Sixth Circuit reversed the judgment of the district court in this case, not because of any error in the district court proceedings, and not because the district court lacked jurisdiction to try this case, but solely because the district... the case was not within Federal diversity jurisdiction at the time that the case was removed from State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.097" offset="270041">Because this ruling conflicts with prior decisions of this Court and makes no sense from the standpoint of judicial economy, we've asked the Court to grant review.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.683" offset="304418">Now, the facts that are necessary to understand the legal issue are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.315" offset="322913">The plaintiff, James Lewis, was injured while operating a bulldozer manufactured by Caterpillar and serviced by Whayne Supply Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.811" offset="356872">He brought suit in Kentucky State court against Caterpillar and Whayne Supply alleging a number of tort claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.055" offset="381845">Liberty Mutual Insurance Group which had paid Lewis worker's compensation benefits intervened as a plaintiff to protect its subrogation rights and brought virtually identical tort claims against Caterpillar and Whayne Supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.585" offset="435971">Now, at the time the complaint was filed, the case was not removable to Federal court because both plaintiff Lewis and defendant Whayne Supply were citizens of Kentucky, so there wasn't complete diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.131" offset="486230">Several months later, however, Caterpillar's counsel learned that Lewis had settled his claim with Whayne Supply, the non-diverse defendant, and Caterpillar thereupon removed the case to Federal court in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.010" offset="537744">Lewis moved to remand the case, making the single argument that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.909" offset="5685329">Now, our position is that this Court needn't go any further than that in resolving this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.515" offset="5711765">The Sixth Circuit was plainly wrong we believe in reversing the judgment below for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because it's undisputed that diversity jurisdiction existed at the time of trial and at the time of judgment and existed on appeal, exists today in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.683" offset="5764428">This Court should apply its settled precedents to reverse the court of appeals judgment and to send the case back for consideration of the rest of plaintiff's arguments on appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1440.375" offset="5891174">Instead, his brief conjures up a completely different statutory argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.308" offset="9198903">The petitioner argues that Newman-Green v. Alfonzo-Larrain would allow the judgment to stand under a harmless error theory, but that is not applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.266" offset="9246759">First of all, Newman-Green does not deal with removal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.327" offset="9262955">Newman-Green deals with two specific areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.808" offset="9272882">First, the question of 28 U.S.C. 1653, as has been noted today, provides that the court of appeals could amend defective allegations of jurisdiction but not defects in jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.529" offset="9327739">And, second, the court of appeals ruled that they could dismiss a dispensable party under rule 21 rather than remanding to the district court for the district court to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.255" offset="9378730">So, in looking at Newman-Green, it would be my position that Newman-Green does not have any bearing upon the matter at bar as it has nothing to do with removal but merely addresses the interpretation of a statute of Congress and a rule of civil procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.518" offset="9443722">In summary, with regard to this argument, I would submit that the rule of this Court has been clear that the statutes of Congress are to be strictly interpreted, and I would ask this Court today to strictly construe the statutes and ask that the judgment of the Sixth Circuit be affirmed and this matter be remanded to the State court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="2353.554" offset="9543824">Just two short things, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.905" offset="9557303">First, the suggestion has been made that Caterpillar didn't make this argument until its rehearing petition in the court of appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.468" offset="9579559">That's simply not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.279" offset="9582798">Apparently during the oral argument in the Sixth Circuit, some question arose as to what would happen if the jurisdictional error was cured, and Caterpillar on September 28th, 1995, after the oral argument but before the Sixth Circuit decided this case, sent up a post-argument letter which cited Grubbs, cited lower court cases like Able v. Upjohn which cited Finn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.654" offset="9668271">So, all of these cases were before the Sixth Circuit, in addition to this argument being before the Sixth Circuit, prior to the Sixth Circuit's decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.858" offset="9697110">Second, let me just say one last thing about this 1-year provision in addition to the fact that it wasn't violated here and in addition to the fact that this argument has never been preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.094" offset="9733995">The purpose of the 1-year provision... Congress put the 1-year limit in the statute a few years ago in order to prevent the delays and disruptions that occur when a case is rested out of one court system and put in another court system after a lot of work has been done on a case in the first court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.374" offset="9795122">That's why the 1-year provision is in there, to prevent diversity removals after a case has progressed quite a while in State court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.308" offset="9818841">Yet, that's the precisely the evil that would occur here if the plaintiff's argument prevailed because it would mean that a case that has been essentially completed in Federal court would have to start all over again from scratch in State court and be retried there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.878" offset="9873175">So, the plaintiff's argument... not only is it inconsistent with the language of the 1-year provision, since the removal occurred here prior to a year, it's plainly inconsistent with Congress' policy in putting the 1-year provision in the statute to acquire a case that's gone to verdict in Federal court to be tried again from scratch in State court, even though there was no error in the Federal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.570" offset="9943915">So, we would ask that the decision and the judgment of the court of appeals be reversed and that the plaintiff be allowed to raise whatever other arguments he had on appeal in the Sixth Circuit.</text>
