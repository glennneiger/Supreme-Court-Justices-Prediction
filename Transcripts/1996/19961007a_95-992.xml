          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_bartow_farr_iii" startTime="10.869" stopTime="95.046">
            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="10.869" offset="183908">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.932" offset="204074">At the outset, if I may, I would like to explain briefly why we think that neither of the interests now asserted by the Government to support the must-carry law justifies the burdens that it imposes on speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.753" offset="259349">The first argument, that the law merely regulates anticompetitive conduct, fails for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.705" offset="287248">First, just as the Government can't ban all fund-raising on the ground that some of it might be fraudulent, here the Government can't forbid the sort of protected activity at issue, choosing what speech to offer, unless it shows at a minimum that those decisions are generally anticompetitive acts and thus fall outside the scope of the First Amendment, otherwise, the law is reaching too far into protected activity in an effort to get at unprotected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.427" offset="410128">The record, however, shows that cable operators voluntarily carry the vast majority of broadcast stations, those accounting for some 98 percent of actual viewing, and it is wholly implausible to presume that, were it not for some sort of anticompetitive bias, the cable systems would carry every broadcast station regardless of how minimal the viewership, in preference to the 150 or so other programmers that are also seeking access.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="95.046" stopTime="118.821">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="95.046" offset="520574">Well, at some point during the argument... maybe now if it's convenient... would you just explain this to me, Mr. Farr.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.598" offset="546801">I've always had this difficulty with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.570" offset="558713">The cable operators say, this is so terribly burdensome.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.134" offset="572923">We have to cancel out programmers whom we'd rather have.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.625" offset="586925">And then on the other hand it says in its brief, well, we're not really cancelling the broadcasters.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.119" offset="604897">All this is unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.248" offset="609390">It seems to me you can't have it both ways.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_bartow_farr_iii" startTime="118.821" stopTime="170.093">
            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="118.821" offset="615660">Well, I think there are two different questions that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.883" offset="627885">First of all, there can be a burden on rights that is substantial, even though as a mathematical matter the burden on speech itself is not particularly substantial, but I don't even think that is the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.581" offset="682742">I mean, there are across the country not only stations that in the past have been dropped and were restored by must-carry, but many stations that are locked in, and as the record shows now in the case, two out of every three subscribers is served by a system that is channel-blocked, that is, it has no available channels at all for programming, and the other third of subscribers are served by systems that will be channel-blocked at some point.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.560" offset="794651">The Government's expert concedes that no cable system actually builds in excess capacity for permanent use.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="anthony_m_kennedy" startTime="170.093" stopTime="179.379">
            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="170.093" offset="820773">Well, can we conclude from your argument that if you prevail on this case a large number of broadcasters will be dropped?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_bartow_farr_iii" startTime="179.379" stopTime="300.629">
            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="179.379" offset="857867">Well, I guess it depends on what the term large number of broadcasters means.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.993" offset="880332">What the record shows, and I think this is consistent with essentially the Government's interpretation of it as well, is that the cable operators in the past, without must-carry, voluntarily carried virtually all network affiliates, they carried virtually all VHF independent stations, they carried a considerable majority of UHF stations, about 80 percent of educational stations, and even one out of three of every station that did not command even a measurable viewership.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.046" offset="1020558">Now, if one looks at that pattern, what that shows... and then groups that with stations community by community.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.133" offset="1052949">What that effectively shows is that in communities with relatively small numbers of stations, four, five, six, which tends to be more the norm, the cable system tends to carry... not always, but tends to carry all of the stations, or most of the stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.160" offset="1113031">Then as you get into markets where there are more and more stations, 10, 12, 14, those tend to be the stations that cable systems do not regularly carry.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.127" offset="1152946">The question then depends on whether those stations, even though they have very low viewership, tend to add something to the overall package that a cable operator is trying to provide to its subscribers, and many of those stations do.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.927" offset="1208117">That's why they're carried.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.468" offset="1210311">But the fact is, cable operators will not carry all of the very lightly viewed stations if they believe there is other programming that will provide a better fit in the package that it's offering to subscribers.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.698" offset="1263183">I don't think there's any way to put an exact number on that, but we know from the history that the number was not... in terms of must-carry ads was only 6,000 in the past, and I assume some of those would still be carried, and then of the 30,000, some number of those would not be carried even though they were before.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="300.629" stopTime="340.637">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="300.629" offset="1342909">How do you think we ought to assess the significance of the fact... I take it's a fact... that the brunt of the decisions not to carry tends to fall on the new stations?</text>
            <text syncTime="311.206" offset="1385227">I think the figures were that in the absence of must-carry about 50 percent of the new public broadcasting channels did not get carried, and something I think in the neighborhood of a third of the new nonpublic channels did not get carried, so the brunt of the decisions not to carry by the cable operators tends to fall on the new stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.834" offset="1495673">How do we assess the significance of that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_bartow_farr_iii" startTime="340.637" stopTime="418.787">
            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="340.637" offset="1502987">Well, I think first of all it very much would depend on what the programming of the new stations would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.859" offset="1527856">During the period without must-carry, Justice Souter, as the Court I think is aware from the record, there was a great increase in the overall number of broadcast stations, both commercial and noncommercial.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.759" offset="1579473">During the period from '85 to '92, there were 270 new stations, and from the period of 1980 to 1992, every market of the 209 ADI's in the country had either the same number of stations or a greater number, and most had a greater number.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.902" offset="1655960">So when there are proliferations of stations like that, the question of whether their programming is going to be of interest to the particular community, or the particular subscribers to a cable system, I think will depend very much on what kind of programming it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.652" offset="1718967">As your question indicates, obviously cable programmers do carry a substantial number of even those brand new stations, obviously because they find something in the programming that they feel will appeal generally to their subscribers, but I think there can't be any absolute question as to whether each one will be carried or each one will not be carried.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.117" offset="1808829">I think it depends on the circumstances.</text>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="418.787" offset="1815516">Do we know how many of those... in the period before the present must-carry rules, do we know how many of those 50 percent and 33-1/3 percent, or whatever it was, failed to survive when they were not picked up by the cable channels?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="h_bartow_farr_iii" startTime="434.268" stopTime="460.895">
            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr, III</label>
            <text syncTime="434.268" offset="1877478">Well, the numbers on stations that do not survive suggest that the number is very low.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.521" offset="1898481">I don't know that the number is broken out by whether they were brand new stations or whether they were stations that had previously existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.956" offset="1932231">Of course, the bringing on, even if you had no cable whatsoever, the fact that you are increasing the number of stations within particular television markets will put pressure on the other broadcasting stations.</text>

          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="460.895" stopTime="462.385">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="460.895" offset="1983953">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.055" offset="1984580">We'd have to know the differential to make a... yeah, to make a--</text>

            <text syncTime="462.385" offset="1989909">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.656" offset="1991059">So I mean, that's simply a factor of numbers in competition, even without respect to cable.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="467.878" offset="2011852">--Following up Justice Kennedy's question, from the cable operator's side, is this a diminishing problem to the extent that there is a problem with must-carry as cable, as the channel capacity expands, this becomes less and less of a problem?</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="491.273" offset="2105475">Well, unfortunately, it has not become less and less of a problem to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.627" offset="2122925">I think anyone who is familiar with the cable industry at the moment knows that channel space is greatly at a premium within the industry as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.032" offset="2156466">One of the reasons for that, of course, is that there are many new cable programmers as well as additional broadcast stations that are seeking access to these cable systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.900" offset="2200038">Now, it is true that in general the capacity of cable systems is expanding, but it is not expanding at a pace that is outstripping the expansion of programmers who are trying to reach the audiences that cable operators serve.</text>

            <text syncTime="643.294" offset="2713606">My recollection is that the figure in the record was that when must-carry came in, about, I think it was 6 percent of cable operators had to drop at least one program in order to comply with must-carry.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.693" offset="2779121">The suggestion was that that figure perhaps is not wholly representative of the significance of must-carry because there was evidence that the cable operators were sort of on their good behavior before that, but in any case we got a figure of about 6 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.056" offset="2844636">Is that figure still, so far as the record shows, the best measure that we have of the, at least the quantified significance of must-carry on the operators?</text>

            <text syncTime="695.016" offset="2920496">First of all, having to add a channel as a result of must-carry doesn't reflect the limitation on cable operators who may at the time have been carrying a broadcast station but now in a different world of programming might choose not to carry that particular station.</text>

            <text syncTime="825.932" offset="3444094">At the beginning of my argument I indicated that I... the reasons that I thought that the anticompetitive rationale for this law would not stand up, that the law is simply way to broad for any demonstrated anticompetitive behavior, and in addition, although I didn't get a chance to say it, there is the tailoring problem specifically addressed by Judge Williams, that the law in fact imposes discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="992.252" offset="4109380">First of all, it doesn't mean that it wouldn't have any impact, because the relationship between cable operators and their subscribers is essentially the coin of the realm for cable operators, and for them to put programming on and take it off does introduce some irritation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.163" offset="4169044">The second point is that I'm not sure it really serves the Government interest to have a broadcast station on for a month or two and then take it off, but if the Government felt that that... and could demonstrate that that did substantially advance its interest, that would be a less restrictive alternative.</text>

            <text syncTime="1173.641" offset="4834958">Whether it had an effect on the public TV station is a separate question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1188.681" offset="4895144">As I said, it is limited to a certain number of operators, and even those, most of them have a relatively small number of interests in programmers, but I should say something which I think has not really received enough attention in this case in the lower courts as well, that I think vertical integration is essentially a red herring here, and I think that for a couple of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.877" offset="4991901">I think Judge Williams is perfectly correct that if you look at vertical integration the statute is not at all tailored to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.341" offset="5021785">It applies to operators who aren't vertically integrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.642" offset="5030980">It applies to decisions between nonintegrated programmers and broadcast stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.496" offset="5046340">But more importantly than that, there is a specific provision in the Communications Act that deals with vertical integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.612" offset="5082807">In fact, there are several of them, and the... one of the provisions authorizes the commission to set limits on the number of integrated programmers that an operator can carry, which has been set basically at 40 percent, but another one of them has a specific nondiscrimination provision barring cable operators from discriminating on the basis of affiliation, so the idea that the must-carry law itself, that part of the act was intended to remedy a problem of vertical integration it seems to me is belied by the other purposes... excuse me, by the other provisions of the act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.569" offset="5250618">Now, I'd just like to make one point about the anticompetitive argument, because I think it's critical in thinking about what the Government calls structural regulation, but keep in mind two things about structural regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.912" offset="5332016">First of all, just calling something structural regulation doesn't seem to me to indicate much about where... how it should be analyzed under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.579" offset="5370677">First of all, the question is what does it regulate, and what the structural regulation here is regulating is who can speak on a cable system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.672" offset="5399098">The second thing is that structural regulation is by its nature prophylactic, and prophylactic regulation is, as this Court has often said, disfavored under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.133" offset="5452910">So I would submit that just because the Government characterizes something as economic regulation or structural regulation, even under O'Brien, the Court has to look carefully at the assumptions that the Government makes to justify a broad prophylactic law and, furthermore, has to look at the remedy that's imposed to see if the remedy is consistent with the types of remedies that are imposed in other industries not involving speech, because if it's not, if the remedy that is used, as it is here, is broader than what would be used in another comparable situation, then the Government it seems to me has a strong burden of answering why the other remedy is not a suitable, less restrictive--</text>

            <text syncTime="1418.901" offset="5816012">I want to be clear that the Government interest in this case is important, substantial, content-neutral, unrelated to the suppression of free expression, and solidly grounded in reasonable inferences that are based upon substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.052" offset="5876616">In spite of the talk about the anticompetitive market foreclosure effects, there is, as Justice Kennedy's opinion recognized in Turner I, a very clear principal goal of the must-carry law, and that is to preserve a healthy multiplicity of broadcast sources for the 40 percent of American homes that do not have cable, homes that rely upon free, over-the-air broadcasting as the entire source of their television programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.581" offset="6002736">When cable systems deny carriage to local broadcast stations, and thereby foreclose those stations from reaching the 60-percent of households, often more affluent, that rely upon cable, those local broadcast stations lose revenue and suffer financially.</text>

            <text syncTime="2593.592" offset="10514709">The first is, is that Congress reasonably predicted that in the absence of must-carry there would be significant injury to broadcast stations which would threaten the Government interest in preserving a multiplicity of broadcast sources, and the second point is that the presence of must-carry has actually caused very modest and decreasing injury to cable operators and cable programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.718" offset="10627245">First, on the injury to broadcast stations, Congress did not predict that the entire broadcast system would disappear without must-carry, but it did specifically predict in its findings that without must-carry, quote, additional local broadcast signals will be deleted, repositioned, or not carried, and that would threaten the multiplicity of broadcast sources which was the Government interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3054.584" offset="12358745">First of all, the cable industry itself did not dispute before Congress that lack of carriage would cripple the broadcast industry and, in fact, in this case we produced in discovery their own documents in which they studied this very problem that you're asking, and they concluded that carriage is critical to broadcast stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.077" offset="12432724">If you look at the Joint Appendix at pages 2147 and 2158, those are cable documents which are sealed, because the cable industry insisted that they remain sealed, but those documents themselves conclude that carriage is critical to the survival of a broadcast station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.486" offset="12490298">It may be that the broadcast station would be forced to pay more attention to the local market, but its advertising revenues would shrink by at least 60 percent, and without the advertising revenues lost to the cable audience it wouldn't have the revenue to produce the programming that would be responsive to the over-the-air audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.889" offset="12559993">That's what Congress reasonably concluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.209" offset="12565217">Let me simply say that, with respect to the injury to cable, that's modest indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.273" offset="12589459">Only 1 percent of the channel capacity in this Nation is occupied by new, must-carry stations cable operators were forced to add.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.057" offset="12620597">This Court also asked how much channel capacity, previously unused channel capacity could be devoted to the carriage of must-carry stations, and the answer, as the evidence shows, is that 87 percent of the time when a cable operator was forced to add a must-carry station, it did so with previously unused channel capacity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3153.571" offset="12754657">The specific finding by Congress made in the act is that as a result of the economic incentive that cable systems have to delete its set of local broadcast systems, coupled with the absence of must-carry, the economic viability of free local broadcast television and its ability to originate quality local programming will be seriously jeopardized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.475" offset="12842324">That is the finding by Congress itself, not arguments made by the executive branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.729" offset="12863327">Then, however, it seems that the argument had turned at some point to survival of broadcasters, that in fact the existence of cable itself would harm individual broadcasters, which in our view at least is itself a less significant interest than some broad... broader interest indicating that a multiplicity of voices in a significant number of communities would be lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.094" offset="12968757">In fact, this Court has recognized, and Congress has said before, that it is typically not concerned with the fate of individual broadcast stations, but rather with the system as a whole.</text>
