            <text syncTime="1738.672" offset="7099888">This Court has, on several occasions, indicated reasons why the tribal court lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Stockert and A-1 in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.051" offset="7141370">Tribal courts exist primarily to apply tribal customs between tribal members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.664" offset="7163836">In this instance, the tribe has given up its power to exclude nonmembers from the State highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.797" offset="7188391">In using the State highway on this occasion, Mr. Stockert did not give up his rights to due process, equal protection or trial by a jury of his peers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1769.553" offset="7223395">So the result would be different if the accident had occurred inside the reservation, on a reservation road, not a road on which the State had a perpetual easement?</text>

            <text syncTime="1784.645" offset="7283790">So then you're not relying on, as Justice Souter spoke, this case could be... could be described as a State highway case, and that would be the end of it, but I think you're telling us now that... that even if it occurred on a reservation road, there would not be tribal jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1805.310" offset="7366441">In this... the precedents of this Court's would indicate that the State's authority over nonmembers of the tribe, over its citizens, reaches into the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.897" offset="7404789">And so it doesn't necessarily require that the road has been alienated by the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.411" offset="7426836">But in this case, that gives the Respondents an even stronger position, because this is a State highway and it is regulated by the State and it is controlled by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.099" offset="7461632">And as Justice Breyer indicated, there are interstate highways that run through reservations as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.444" offset="7482947">And citizens of this country have no idea when they enter an interstate highway to travel to Yellowstone Park or something out in the West that they're subjecting themselves to the tort jurisdiction of a tribal court that could deprive them of their property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1981.593" offset="8071538">Are those two reasons... the fact that we have real question about what the substantive legal regime will be in a tribal court and, number two, we have a real question about due process because of the appointment scheme... are those two reasons, reasons that you rely significantly on and feel that we should rely significantly on in deciding this case?</text>
