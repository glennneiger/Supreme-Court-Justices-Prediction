            <text syncTime="222.547" offset="1035813">Congress, as in the integrated bar context and as in the union context, has chose to leave in the first instance to the regulated industry the determination whether, in a particular region, as for a particular commodity, that interest is threatened, but we think that both the overwhelming support by the industry and the record in this case indicate that that interest was certainly implicated here.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.863" offset="1193070">Where private industry and, I would add, the Secretary has to make a determination that private... that generic advertising would further... tend to further the interest of the act, that is because in a particular region, under a particular marketing order, the need exists.</text>

            <text syncTime="416.405" offset="1811231">Taking peaches as an example, first, California is responsible for the majority of peaches that wind up on people's shelves, but more importantly, between two different regions there are vast disparities in labor costs, in quality.</text>
