            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="22.967" offset="232948">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="32.992" offset="272967">This case involves the marital and charitable deductions to the Federal estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.076" offset="293343">As with some other tax cases, and perhaps more so than most, this case involves the central logical principle that is surrounded and almost obscured by a wealth of technical detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.005" offset="341094">I would therefore like to focus first on the central logical principle and discuss the technical issues later.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.279" offset="370143">The gross estate is defined as the value on the date of death of the property owned by the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.001" offset="401072">The marital and charitable deductions to the gross estate are defined by statute as the value of the property that passes to the spouse and charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.999" offset="441091">When, as in this case, the bequest left to the spouse or charity is burdened by the obligation of paying some expense or administration expense or other claim against the estate, the value of the property that passes under the bequest is obviously less than the full face value of the bequest.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.773" offset="516115">It is the face value of the bequest, reduced by the cost of satisfying the obligations that have been imposed on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.616" offset="543491">Thus, in 1963, this Court explained in United States v. Stapf that when the burden of paying administration expenses' or other claims against the estate is placed on the marital bequest, the decedent has in effect left that portion of the estate not to the spouse, but has designated it for payment of the claims of others.</text>

            <text syncTime="122.360" offset="630531">And in that case it was the decedent's act that did it, as I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.413" offset="642652">Wasn't it the provision of the will that required it in that case?</text>

            <text syncTime="129.116" offset="657490">It was... actually if I remember Stapf correctly, there was an option given to the heir as to how to take under the will or not take under the will, and it dealt with the specifics of the Texas community property rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.389" offset="858632">But in Stapf, the Court in speaking specifically of administration expenses, said that they, like claims against the estate, represent... I'm sorry... when the obligation for administration expenses or to pay claims against the estate is placed on the marital bequest, that that reduces the value of the marital bequest because the decedent has in concept set aside a portion of the bequest not to go to the spouse, but to someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.586" offset="963436">And obviously, the portion of the bequest that's to go to someone else is not within the scope of the marital deduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.299" offset="986214">Mr. Jones, if we value the estate at the time of death, why don't we also value these encumbrances at the time of death?</text>
            <text syncTime="221.435" offset="1026757">That is one part of your argument that I don't follow.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.918" offset="1160712">Administration expenses are themselves a deduction under the Federal estate tax on a dollar-for-dollar basis even though administration expenses may be incurred 10 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.266" offset="1202090">We do not make the estate bring those expenses back to the present value in determining the administration expense deduction for the... now, if we did, then it would make some sense to also bring back to present value the reduction from the marital deduction that occurs because of the administration expenses, but we don't do either.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.964" offset="1504902">If you had two alternative bequests, the decedent calls you in his study and says, I'm going to let you choose.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.126" offset="1577522">But in the first case, the interest earned by that account at 10 percent is going to be added to it, so at the end of the year you can withdraw $110,000, but in the second case, the interest earned by that account is not going to go to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.494" offset="1631021">It's going to go to the payment of administration expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.046" offset="1641261">So, at the end of the year, you'll still just get $100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.297" offset="1654218">You'd say, I would like the first bequest because the present value, the real value, of that bequest is higher.</text>

            <text syncTime="760.748" offset="3184053">This is a classic example that the Court dealt with in the Stapf case where the net value of the marital bequest is the $11 million reduced by the obligation left under the will to pay the administration expenses, which turned out to be $10 million.</text>

            <text syncTime="789.908" offset="3300663">What happened in this case is that, in your hypothetical, let's say $10 million in income was earned by this asset after death.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.253" offset="3334100">In that case, the executor could elect to take the administration costs against the estate tax return and have zero income tax liability on the $10 million of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.902" offset="3388644">And our point is that that doesn't affect the calculation of the marital deduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2020.724" offset="8223909">The difference between those courts that got the answer right and those that didn't, those that got it right took the time to carefully define their terms, as the Tax Court did in its first footnote, before rushing to analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.121" offset="8269571">And as a consequence, they avoided the false equation that's been so sharply criticized by the commentators, the false equation that equates marital share with marital deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.359" offset="8310531">Marital deduction consists solely of date-of-death corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.660" offset="8319726">Marital share consists of both the corpus and income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.622" offset="8331534">Two, the statutory structure of the Federal estate tax regime is built upon the sound, sensible foundation of symmetry, and that symmetry is achieved by taking the same statutory term for measuring property coming in and leaving the estate, value, and applying it at the same precise point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.121" offset="8405512">Indeed, we feel like we believe that that's a constitutionally driven proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.635" offset="8419619">This is a transfer tax that we're working with, and we take a picture at the effective transfer date by operation of law which is the date of death, unless of course the decedent... excuse me... the executor elects an alternate valuation date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.636" offset="8475625">To show you how closely tied this inclusion and distribution concept is, there's a specific statute that says if my fiduciary, when I die, elects the alternate valuation date, that alternate valuation date must be used not only for inclusion purposes, it must also be used for charitable contribution and for marital deduction purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.279" offset="8558172">We, time permitting, hope to demonstrate the practical application of these principles to reality and how it renders the result of order and symmetry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2211.958" offset="8988879">2056(b)(4)(B) speaks only to obligations on corpus.</text>

            <text syncTime="2224.097" offset="9037467">What does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.389" offset="9042587">Well, let me take a step back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.257" offset="9046035">2056(b)(4)(B) says any obligation or encumbrance on, quote, such property or interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.691" offset="9067769">What does such property or interest mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.243" offset="9074038">We take a step upstream to 2056(b)(4) to the introductory paragraph, and it says that property passing to the spouse for which a deduction is allowable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.419" offset="9114685">And what does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.530" offset="9119178">You go to the introductory paragraph of 2056(a) and it says that the deduction that is allowable is only to the extent that it's included in the gross estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.285" offset="9154182">These two statutory provisions are the statutory genesis for the undisputed point that you measure the distribution by the exact same measure that's used for inclusion in the gross estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.894" offset="9204650">And so, we say to you that 2654(b) itself clearly or at least establishes that the obligation must be on corpus.</text>

            <text syncTime="2370.043" offset="9621251">The grant of the power occurs at the same time that the transferring the gift tax does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.637" offset="9643612">For example, if I'm making out a marital deduction trust and I'm making a transfer, a gift today, to my wife and if I provide this provision, the value is measured today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2445.972" offset="9924899">In Revenue Rule 69-56, the Government says there is no diminution in the marital deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.395" offset="9946632">You tie that into Revenue Ruling 88-12, which says you look... in determining the impact of debts and expenses in calculating the net value... in calculating the net value... of the marital deduction, State law is determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.235" offset="10009953">The other aspect that arises is this concept that we are somehow equating the treatment under 2053 with the treatment under 2056(b)(4)(B).</text>

            <text syncTime="2627.170" offset="10649744">And let me see if I might draw some distinctions on this particular hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.590" offset="10663432">$2 million estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.353" offset="10670433">If under the controlling testamentary documents and State... excuse me... and State law, it has to be paid out of corpus, the surviving spouse gets $1.8 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.990" offset="10708990">If, on the other hand, it permits a balancing in the allocation of expenses between the income beneficiary and the corpus beneficiary and if, for whatever reason, just for simplicity purposes let's assume that the whole expenses were permitted to be paid out of income and were properly under State law and properly under controlling testamentary documents, then I as the fiduciary am transferring $2 million of property to the spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.646" offset="10811599">That's got to be recognized, the date-of-death value of what's being included, the date-of-death value of what's being distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.277" offset="10830198">And I've got a check to various vendors that total $200,000, and so there's $2.2 million of reality that has flowed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.495" offset="10871054">Under the Government's approach, they would take that amount properly paid out of the expenses... excuse me... those expenses properly paid out of income and pretend it was paid out of capital so that the fiction would work that there's only $2 million of distributions when it's properly $2.2 million of distributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.238" offset="10942002">Your example with respect to the Martian is very much like the situation in Ballantine and Roney where there was an obligation on corpus and it's viewed... and I agree with this completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.984" offset="10980977">It's viewed that whereas the obligation on corpus if somebody else comes in and helps them out, it doesn't change the... you cannot violate State law and the controlling testamentary documents and circumvent and alter the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.300" offset="11022250">You got to follow what the commitments are on corpus, as the Commissioner said in Revenue Ruling 88-12.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.763" offset="11044089">And so, at first blush everything seems to stack up nicely, but what happens is you only get to that result and ignore the $2 million... excuse me... $200,000 properly paid out of income under State law and controlling testamentary documents if you double count, if you use $2 to create every $1 of deduction, and you ignore the payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.286" offset="11126218">See, the problem... the additional problem with that is let's assume that in a situation there where the expenses are paid out of income, that we're going to pretend it reduces the marital corpus anyway, what that does is that creates this gap, this disappearing residuary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.069" offset="11193300">And then that creates a tax which is... you say, well, now where are we going to pay that tax from?</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.441" offset="11210854">Well, you already spent all your income on the expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.244" offset="11218064">You can't pay it out of there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.052" offset="11221303">The Government would presume it's paid out of corpus anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.383" offset="11230603">So, the tax on that $200,000 is taken back in to reduce the amount of corpus flowing to the wife which creates another tax which is taken back in to further reduce the marital deduction of the wife which creates another tax, spiraling downward, ever downward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.792" offset="11288177">This is the multiplier effect addressed by the amicus brief on behalf of the American Council on Education and United Way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.987" offset="11317016">And for that reason, it creates sort of a chaotic result which... because you don't have any income left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.011" offset="11337078">What's worse... and this is sort of the point of the Government's position with respect to, well, you can always just sort of waive your election under 642(g) and leave it on the gift tax return, leave the expenses on the gift tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.988" offset="11385039">The difficulty with that is that, as the commentators have recognized, that operates to repeal 642(g).</text>

            <text syncTime="2825.848" offset="11444389">What that does is, sure, you can take the expenses that you paid out of income in your hypothetical, sir, the $200,000 expenses that were actually paid out of income and move them back over to the estate tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.226" offset="11493917">What happens if you do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.457" offset="11502903">And that's I think the Government's ultimate object.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.851" offset="11512412">You end up with an income tax on gross income, on the full $200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.925" offset="11540729">By depriving the income beneficiary the benefit of those deductions, you create a tax on gross income, and that income beneficiary doesn't have any net income to pay those taxes with.</text>

            <text syncTime="3082.025" offset="12469121">But it... and it's arisen in five cases by our count in 50 years... five cases in 50 years... in which the deductions are being shaved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.852" offset="12500468">But that concept, that date-of-death valuation concept, impacts the inclusion of every asset on every estate in America.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.346" offset="12530456">And so, if we open the door, contrary to this Court's holding in Ithaca Trust, contrary to this Court's holding on the inclusion side in Maass v. Higgins and Bull v. United States, to hindsight, I think the Government's going to lose far more revenue than they would gain by shaving these deductions in these five cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.988" offset="12604957">And so, I say to you I think it is a broad concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.040" offset="12617183">I think we're dealing with fundamental principles of estate taxation, and it's a dangerous thing for a very small benefit here to open a door to a large loss there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.248" offset="12658038">I don't know if that's at all responsive to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.291" offset="12670263">The fact of the matter is, Your Honor, we subscribe to Justice Holmes' theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.914" offset="12696699">Justice Holmes advocated in his lectures before Harvard... they were ultimately embodied in the common law... that the law ought to be more concerned with the practical application to reality based upon experience than with detached logic or--</text>

            <text syncTime="3175.037" offset="12841209">In Ithaca Trust, we were dealing with a deduction, a circumstance where a gentleman died.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.701" offset="12863883">He left a life estate to his wife with the remainder interest to the charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.284" offset="12878198">And the question was, how do we measure the value of that charitable deduction?</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.796" offset="12896275">As events turned out, the wife regrettably died by way of accident 1 year later and the State wanted to come in and said, well, you know, the life estate is much smaller and therefore the remainder interest is much greater and therefore the charitable contribution deduction is much greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.756" offset="12952072">And Justice Holmes, on behalf of this Court in Ithaca Trust said, I know the temptation to take what is now the readily known fact, the matter of certainty, to resolve the past event, but if we're to be true to this principle of date-of-death valuation for deduction purposes, distribution purposes, in addition to being true to this principle in Maass v. Higgins and Bull v. United States for inclusion purposes, we cannot succumb to the temptation of using hindsight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.813" offset="13056353">We cannot proceed to resolve those uncertainties that existed, that must exist in every valuation at the date of valuation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3332.431" offset="13470760">The first is that Stapf by its terms applies its net value logic to administration expenses as well as to other claims against the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.247" offset="13506077">At page 134, the Court said in both instances, referring to both administration expenses and claims, by directing that payment be made of debts chargeable to another or to non-estate property reduces his net estate and in effect confers a gift or bequest upon another, which is exactly why we have to reduce the marital deduction because the net value of the bequest has been burdened by this encumbrance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.060" offset="13597297">I need to say very briefly that the regulations and rulings that the Tax Court and that the taxpayer rely on are a classic example of apples and oranges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.277" offset="13634182">The regulations and rulings that the Tax Court relied on were under 2056(b)(5) which relates to a marital deduction when a gift is left in trust, where the spouse gets--</text>
