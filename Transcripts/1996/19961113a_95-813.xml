            <text syncTime="13.180" offset="198198">This case arises from the Ninth Circuit and raises the question whether farmers and irrigation districts that receive water pursuant to Federal contracts have standing to complain when their water supplies are cut, their crops threatened, and their land devalued as a consequence of Government conduct alleged to violate the provisions of the Endangered Species Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="38.069" offset="297777">In part, that's... yes, absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.919" offset="305195">According to the Ninth Circuit, the answer to the question I posed is no because petitioners' competitive, economic-based interest in the water places them outside a zone of interest protected by the ESA.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.558" offset="355664">We believe this ruling goes well beyond the bounds of any standing decision of this Court, and notably, neither the Government nor any amicus attempts to defend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.654" offset="392131">If prudential considerations apply at all to actions commenced under the citizen suit provision of the ESA, they are more than satisfied by the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.741" offset="428493">Their water supply contracts and the claims they alleged in their complaint place them well within any zone of interest either protected or regulated by the ESA--</text>
            <text syncTime="79.818" offset="464751">And for the same reason, petitioners also have a right to review under the Administrative Procedure Act since they are persons adversely affected or aggrieved within the meaning of the relevant statute, namely, the ESA.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.507" offset="507488">Finally, unless the ruling of the Ninth circuit is reversed, we believe there will be at least three farreaching and negative effects from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.892" offset="541029">First, there will exist a prudential standing scheme under the ESA that overtly discriminates against economically based plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.645" offset="572062">Second, because the courthouse doors will be closed to everyone except environmental plaintiffs, there will be one-sided enforcement of the ESA.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.892" offset="609052">Finally, the result of that one-sided enforcement we believe will be skewed implementation of the act that continually presses the Government forward to a position of over-regulation instead of the balance sought by Congress when it has committed the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="205.343" offset="966825">I mean, if there is no standing, we have no jurisdiction over the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="215.130" offset="1006008">I'm not intending to say that the Article III issues were not properly raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.695" offset="1032235">There's a question, however, that may arise as to which do you get to first: the prudential issues or the Article III issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.000" offset="1061493">Our reading of the decisions of this Court indicate that while preliminary jurisdictional questions may be approached first, certainly before merits issues are to be decided, that there's no decision of this Court which indicates which comes first.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.269" offset="1110603">We think there are good reasons here for dealing with the prudential questions before you reach the Article III questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.555" offset="1147697">Those were the issues that were the subject for the... of the petition of writ of certiorari and those were the issues on which certiorari was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.428" offset="1175177">In addition, those are the issues, the prudential issues, that have split the courts of appeal, and as I think we've indicated in a letter to the Court, that split has only grown since cert was granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.815" offset="1268696">I think that's particularly appropriate, in fact, in the circumstances in this case because it does arise on motions to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.760" offset="1296490">And according to Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, at that stage of the case, the burden for a petitioner attempting to deal with Article III is a more modest one--</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.939" offset="6833195">The zone of interest test or formulation, as this Court said in the Clarke decision, is ultimately traceable as a gloss on the Administrative Procedure Act when there... for determining when there's a cause of action under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.019" offset="6885545">At least that's where it originated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.919" offset="6893173">So, it's ultimately a question of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.023" offset="6905607">In our view the proper approach to whether there is a cause of action under the Endangered Species Act citizen suit provision in this case is also a question of statutory interpretation, not by reference to unanchored questions of zone of interest, but by reference to the specific text of the citizen suit provision that we have at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.624" offset="6980004">And as to that, we say that there is... the only cognizable claims under the citizen suit provisions are things for violations of the act, and as we explain in our brief, violations of the act refer to on-the-ground activities that could be engaged in by a private person or by a Federal agency with on-the-ground responsibilities equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.448" offset="7063282">In other words, the citizen suit provision for actions against any person, including the United States, includes situations in which the United States, like any person, might be taking on-the-ground activities that would adversely affect a species.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.710" offset="7120333">In our view it does not provide an avenue for judicial review of ordinary administrative action of a regulatory nature.</text>
