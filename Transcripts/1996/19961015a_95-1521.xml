            <text syncTime="13.601" offset="197474">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.534" offset="213252">This case involves a challenge to undertakings by the United States in connection with a comprehensive plan of action, an international agreement entered into by 50 countries in 1989 to address the migrant crisis in Southeast Asia in the 1980's.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.893" offset="278662">By 1989, 750,000 migrants from Vietnam alone had fled to other countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.197" offset="303844">Some countries began to turn back the migrants at sea, which resulted in a loss of life, and Hong Kong revoked its prior policy of treating the arrived migrants as presumptive refugees, and began to treat them instead as illegal aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.116" offset="359537">The comprehensive plan of action, or CPA, was designed to diffuse this crisis, to protect those migrants who genuinely feared persecution, to save the loss of life, or to prevent the loss of life, and also to control further illegal immigration.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.559" offset="433307">Under the CPA, Vietnamese and Laotians were permitted to land in Hong Kong and other countries, and to seek refugee status there.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.176" offset="471759">Those who were screened in or found to be refugees under international standards and under the auspices of the UNHCR were permitted to remain temporarily and seek resettlement in third countries, but a central tenet of the CPA was those that were screened and found not to be refugees would be repatriated to their countries of origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.477" offset="557023">That would be either voluntarily, it was hoped, or if need be, eventually involuntarily.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.723" offset="578026">Mr. Kneedler, may I ask you to clarify at the outset what the Government's position is with respect to the statement by the respondents that the respondents requested the State Department to seek from the Hong Kong Government an extension of the undertaking to process these people to cover the proceedings on remand, and that the Department refused, so that a remand would force the Hong Kong Government's undertaking to lapse and would likely subject respondents to immediate forcible repatriation.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.634" offset="773630">I'm informed by the State Department that the State Department did not refuse that.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.386" offset="792648">And I'm informed that last week there were discussions approaching the Government of Hong Kong about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.801" offset="818248">Those discussions again were taken up over the weekend, and just this morning we received from Hong Kong a letter in which Hong Kong... and I just received it.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.209" offset="863910">I've given it to opposing counsel, but we did not have time to transmit it to the Court this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.561" offset="881359">In that letter, Hong Kong confirms a request made by the United States that the 24 Vietnamese migrants who are listed in an attached memorandum who are the plaintiffs in this case, and those of Lisa Le, basically the migrants for whom we previously had requested and obtained assurances, would not be repatriated before January 1997, January 31, 1997 or the completion of this case, whichever comes first.</text>

            <text syncTime="782.479" offset="3273026">But we certainly did argue that this was... that 1152(a)(1), which bars preference or priority or discrimination in the issuance of visas, did not apply to consular venue, and the argument that consular venue is separately addressed by 1202(a) is just a further argument in support of our basic claim that the... that 1152(a)(1) did not apply to this at all.</text>

I don't know if one calls it justification, or it's not discrimination, that you can look at it either way, that discrimination is a conclusion that encompasses whatever justifications may be offered for the policy, or that it's not discrimination in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.105" offset="3607498">If the question just focused on whether there were distinctions, then the statute would use distinctions, but it uses the word discrimination, which I think we would view as being a conclusion, and read into that should be, particularly on something like consular venue, the ability of the United States to take into account nationality considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.698" offset="3689836">As we point out in our brief, when Congress enacted this provision in 1965, it had long been the policy of the United States before then and since then, for example, to adopt special procedures for security purposes for aliens from particular nations, from communist bloc countries for a while, and as the... there's a declaration cited at page 17 of our... of the petition that describes that history and describes what was before Congress in 1965.</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.084" offset="5035456">Right, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.862" offset="5038486">Now, there is... we recognize the confusion, and there is something to be said, we acknowledge, for this Court going ahead and deciding the case now that it's been briefed and argued and presented to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.152" offset="5091671">Our suggestion of a remand in this case all along, however, was based on this Court's usual course when there's been an intervening change in the law and also when other issues are in the case that haven't been addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.529" offset="5137229">I would like briefly to address those two other issues, getting back to Justice O'Connor's question on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.361" offset="5156559">The first of the other two claims is one that the policy is arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.586" offset="5189474">There are two problems with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.607" offset="5193549">The first is that judicial review of that claim is precluded, as was judicial review of the statutory claim, and that is itself true for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.403" offset="5228657">One, the comprehensive judicial review provisions of the INA establish that review is precluded under the INA, or, excuse me, under the APA, and also visa matters, including consular venue matters, are of the sort traditionally committed to agency discretion, and therefore barred... judicial review is barred for that reason as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.156" offset="5311727">With respect to the preclusion of review, I would just like to point out that the INA contains provisions for judicial review of deportation orders of people who've entered the United States, and also for judicial review of people who are seeking to enter the United States, but in the latter category, only when somebody has arrived at our shores and is in exclusion proceedings and can seek review in habeas corpus, but not because exclusion matters are generally appropriate for judicial review, but because the person is in custody, and therefore has access to habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.498" offset="5437115">In this Court's decision in Brownell v. Tom We Shung in 1956, the Court held that an alien in the United States could have access to the APA to seek judicial review in an exclusion matter, but the Court pointed out it was not suggesting, of course, that an alien who had never reached our shores would be able to do that, and it also cited legislative history of the '52 act in which an exclusive review provision was deleted in which the... in which Congress made clear that it was not providing for review of consular officer decisions, or changing review under the INA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.831" offset="5578385">Then in 1961, Congress came along and specifically overturned the Brownell decision, and provided for judicial review in exclusion only... in exclusion matters only in habeas corpus, and not otherwise, intending to remove the APA, the very basis on which respondents seek to bring a challenge in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.536" offset="5657275">And in fact the Court... we spell this out at pages 25 to 28 of our brief, and in fact the House report on that legislation says that permitting an APA suit would</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.292" offset="5700220">"give recognition to a fallacious doctrine that an alien has a right to enter this country which he may litigate in the courts of the United States against the U.S. Government as a defendant. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.377" offset="5736582">Well, if that was true with respect to aliens who had reached our shores, then a fortiori would be true with respect to aliens who are in Hong Kong who have no rights under the United States Constitution with respect to their admission and no statutory rights that they can invoke in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.939" offset="5802829">But even if this Court were somehow to get around the preclusion of judicial review, we think the respondent's APA claim would fail on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.754" offset="5834071">This is certainly not an arbitrary and capricious policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.746" offset="5846088">The explanation is spelled out at pages 217 to 219 of the Joint Appendix in this case, in which the cable that went to the field in October of 1994 explains that this policy was reinstated after a careful review, after concerns were received from UNHCR and other first... and first asylum countries that screening or processing immigrant visas in Hong Kong and other first asylum countries was discouraging people from returning voluntarily and therefore was seriously undermining the comprehensive plan of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.321" offset="5992373">The State Department also pointed out that since 1990, when it had adopted the opposite view, it believed that conditions in Vietnam had improved, and therefore it was appropriate to insist that people return there before filing for visas to come to the U.S.--</text>

            <text syncTime="1514.024" offset="6199159">The court of appeals itself, for example, applied the change in the regulation on appeal, even though the respondents were invoking claims under the prior regulation, on the theory that no one has a vested right in receiving a visa, and if there's a change in the law, that should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.044" offset="6255270">We would expect the court to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.554" offset="6261330">In fact, we would expect Congress understood, knowing the LAVAS decision, that that would be the rule and it's change in the law would be applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1580.470" offset="6464981">The first issue is whether the statute, section 1152(a)(1), was violated by the Department's policy when that policy was in existence and before the new statute came along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.137" offset="6507612">The second issue is whether the change instituted on September 30, 1996 deprives respondents of the right to relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3199.908" offset="12942721">Because Korematsu applied to people who were citizens of the United States just as much as it applied to someone who had just reached the shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.555" offset="12985353">So it was a blanket policy, and you, by giving the answer that a resident of Hong Kong from Vietnam who had been there for awhile, was not involved in this urgent departure, would be treated like the Frenchman.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.968" offset="13058914">Well, Justice Ginsburg, actually, as I recall in Korematsu and Hirabayashi, at at least one particular time the classification only applied to Japanese on the West Coast who were rounded up and placed into relocation centers, so the fact that it didn't also apply... might not have also applied to Japanese on the East Coast would not have rendered the classification there any the less discriminatory, so in terms of the issue of whether this is discriminatory, there really should be no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.888" offset="13178659">With respect to the CPA argument anyway, it appears to be purely pretextual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.432" offset="13196840">At pages 116 and 117 of the Joint Appendix, the Department was inquiring... received an inquiry from its consulate as to whether or not the processing of a screened-out boat person would violate the CPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.549" offset="13249294">The Department said that to require such a boat person to return to Vietnam to have their visas processed was procedural overkill and not at all necessary to the integrity of the CPA and, in fact, during 4 years of the CPA's existence, from 1989 to 1993, the Department processed visa applications in Hong Kong, and the Department processes visa applications in Hong Kong of nationals from other countries such as Great Britain, England... from Great Britain, from Hong Kong itself, from Australia... so all of these visas are being processed in Hong Kong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.852" offset="13382519">It's hard to understand why this violates the CPA.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="3389.869" offset="13702571">Several points, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.674" offset="13721797">First of all, in Landgraf this Court said when the intervening statute authorizes or affects the propriety of prospective relief, application of the new provision is not retroactive, so analytically the question here is not one of retroactivity, since prospective relief is being asked for, and that's what the Court is being asked to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.366" offset="13804553">This statute specifically speaks to what a court should do, whether a court can construe 1152(a)(1) to prohibit the Secretary from establishing locations for the processing of visas, as Justice Stevens mentioned.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="3432.077" offset="13871426">But Mr. Kneedler, to the extent that this is like a venue provision where you can have this processed, if Congress changes a venue rule while a case is in a tribunal, I assume the case would not have to be dismissed at midstream, that unless Congress said otherwise, the venue that was proper when the case was initiated would stay.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="3457.064" stopTime="3660.127">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="3457.064" offset="13971319">But that would be... that would I think be not upset... I mean, again, that would be a question of statutory construction, it would not be a question of an injunctive action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.998" offset="13999113">It would be a question of a rule of procedure to be applied in an ongoing case much like Landgraf, speaking to what a court has to do, has to decide at the time it's deciding a particular issue in a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.645" offset="14037670">At the time the court decides venue, it decides venue, and the statute shouldn't reach back and change that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.128" offset="14059612">This statute is not retroactive in the sense that people who got visas in 1993 during the interim period when the State Department had a contrary view, will have those visas taken away and be sent back to Hong Kong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.778" offset="14110186">This is entirely prospective, and if there was any doubt about Congress' intent that this governed this case, the letter from the 45 Members of Congress said that the amendment would overturn the adverse result in LAVAS.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.594" offset="14157415">The State Department's letter said it's amendment was intended to reverse the decision in LAVAS.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.366" offset="14176537">Representative Smith said it was an attempt to overrule LAVAS, and Representative Conyers said it would have the immediate effect of requiring two dozen Vietnamese, precisely these two dozen Vietnamese in Hong Kong, to return to Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.587" offset="14229408">There was no doubt that Congress intended and expected this to apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.240" offset="14244037">With respect to the question of discrimination, this only covers people who were screened out under the CPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.024" offset="14267234">Screened out is a term of art under international refugee matters, applying it here to this international agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.347" offset="14292520">It doesn't apply to other people who may be in Hong Kong like a Vietnamese national who may have gotten there in other ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.809" offset="14318329">Also, as the Chief Justice pointed out, this is not invidious discrimination by any means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.094" offset="14343511">The United... Vietnamese have been the beneficiaries of United States immigration policy over the last 15 years to an extent that few other countries have matched: 1.2 million Vietnamese have entered the United States, including 400,000 who have departed from Vietnam during the orderly departure process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.247" offset="14408086">There is no way that this policy can be regarded as invidious discrimination against Vietnamese.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.898" offset="14426685">It is designed to implement valid foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.160" offset="14439746">My last point is that the discussion in this case is... we think underscores why this sort of case doesn't belong in court to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.295" offset="14468272">This is a case challenging foreign policy and migration policy halfway around the world in a suit brought by aliens in a foreign country objecting to the way in which their visas are being processed in a foreign country, a classic matter for which judicial review is precluded, and has traditionally been committed to agency discretion by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.919" offset="14554790">And that rule cannot be circumvented by having a U.S. citizen who happens to have applied for a visa petition to file his or her own suit in U.S. courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.735" offset="14590003">The Immigration Act makes clear that the visa petitioner's interest in a matter such as this is simply filing the visa petition and having the Attorney General determine whether the beneficiary of the visa petition would be entitled to a visa preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.364" offset="14644546">Once that happens, the U.S. person's interest in the matter lapses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.248" offset="14668057">There is no further interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.218" offset="14671923">The alien abroad is accorded a preference and stands entirely on his own or her own with respect to whether there will be any admission to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.825" offset="14710375">In fact, the nondiscrimination provision invoked here speaks in terms of discrimination or preferences with respect to the alien abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.712" offset="14741931">It confers no rights on a U.S. citizen in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.195" offset="14763874">So with respect to both respondent's APA claim and the statutory claim, review is precluded.</text>
