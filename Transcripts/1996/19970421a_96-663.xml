            <text syncTime="10.008" offset="180539">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.181" offset="201228">The last predicate, criminal last predicate act rule of accrual is the most appropriate rule for civil racketeering claims for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.197" offset="241247">First, it takes account of the unique elements of this cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.562" offset="266743">Secondly, it is consistent with the congressional objectives and underlying policies of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.877" offset="291925">Third, it greatly reduces the administrative and judicial burden and the economic burden upon the parties because of its ease of application.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.703" offset="331317">Selection of a rule of accrual in RICO must first of all take account of the sui generis nature of this cause of action and its unique pattern element.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.531" offset="386592">In a garden variety tort case, say a car accident, for example, all of the elements are present at the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.776" offset="419611">This explains the normal, or traditional rule of accrual.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.621" offset="442912">In a RICO case this is not true, because the injury must arise out of a pattern of racketeering activity, and the pattern itself must also be perpetrated by a RICO enterprise.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="92.051" offset="508637">Well, you're assuming... when you say that all of the elements don't have to be present at the beginning, you're assuming that if I am injured by the first of three predicate acts I have suffered a RICO injury, aren't you?</text>
            <text syncTime="111.484" offset="586377">I mean, I agree if I'm injured by the second of three predicate acts I have suffered a RICO injury, but we've never held that the person who is injured by the first of what later becomes a series of predicate acts has suffered a RICO injury, have we?</text>

            <text syncTime="130.205" offset="661296">--Well... no, this Court has not held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.039" offset="672581">However, I think an analysis of what a pattern of racketeering is would help in answering that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.413" offset="702152">If you want me to go on I will, but my understanding of a pattern of racketeering activity is that it is simply a definition that can only be determined in retrospect, such that even two predicate acts, for example, don't necessarily constitute a pattern.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.627" offset="843004">The argument you were just making assumes that, assumes that the first injury constitutes a RICO injury even though at that time there's no pattern and you have not been injured, when you're injured, by a pattern of racketeering activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.177" offset="969123">It can only be decided whether or not it exists in retrospect.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.448" offset="986259">Once we determine that it exists, then that first predicate act is just as much a part of the pattern as the last predicate act, and that's our contention here, and that's why trying to determine when a RICO pattern along this continuum which Congress has defined somehow is borne or springs to life, if you will, under the H.J. Inc. rule of continuity plus relationship, that's an extremely difficult thing for anybody to follow, and certainly difficult for a--</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.677" offset="7931174">But the other part of your question touches on the doctrine of separate accrual, and there, too, we propose the traditional Federal rule of separate accrual which nine circuits have applied to civil RICO claims, and under that rule, as State Farm recognized and other courts recognized, the separate accrual rule means that when there are new separate and different injuries within the limitations period, that will start a new claim, a new cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.740" offset="8063458">That rule does not apply to this case, because both lower courts, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to petitioners, concluded that petitioners suffered no new injuries within 4 years of suit, in fact, no injuries within 6 years of suit--</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.421" offset="13562129">One, the Clayton rule, although that's the basic Clayton rule, that occurrence-of-injury rule has not proved satisfactory even for all Clayton Act violations, which are much narrower in scope than RICO violations, so many Clayton courts have actually imposed different rules, and we think it makes sense to have a single rule for RICO that is broad enough to encompass all the acts that violate RICO.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.344" offset="13649796">Second, frankly, we think that the Clayton rule is a little harsher to plaintiffs than this remedial statute was probably intended to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.893" offset="13696085">We think that what Congress probably presumed, if it presumed anything at all, was that the general Federal accrual rule would apply, and that rule is discovery of injury, and we don't think that in the context of this statute there's anything in the text or purpose of RICO that would mean that Congress would have intended a harsher rule for civil RICO than the general Federal rule of accrual.</text>

            <text syncTime="3429.201" offset="13857312">No, but putting entirely aside congressional intent, in Federal courts it's judge-made law almost always to adopt accrual rules, but those rules are supposed to be consistent with and tied to the purpose of the underlying statute, regardless of what the congressional intent was, and for that reason we think since civil RICO the distinguishing element is injury, it should be discovery of injury that triggers the accrual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.996" offset="13960444">Let me conclude by saying that the Havens Realty case, which has been mentioned here in argument, actually proves our point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.561" offset="13986671">In Havens Realty... it wasn't a unique case, Justice Rehnquist, but in Havens Realty this Court rejected the continuing violations doctrine when applied to a claim that required proof of direct injury to the plaintiff, a misrepresentation claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.842" offset="14055843">It found the continuing violation doctrine not appropriate in that circumstance, only appropriate in the quite different circumstance of discriminatory practices which have indirect injury to the plaintiff even if they do not directly injure the plaintiff.</text>
