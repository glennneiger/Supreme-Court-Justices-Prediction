            <text syncTime="42.421" offset="313268">The Commissioners of Bryan County, Oklahoma, are required by statute to levy and collect nearly $900,000 in taxes to satisfy the judgment in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="57.011" offset="371678">The answer cannot readily be found in any decision of this Court, rather derives from an unprecedented extension of municipal liability contained in the decision of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.268" offset="416713">The Fifth Circuit says Bryan County is liable under section 1983 because its sheriff employed his nephew, who subsequently was held to have used excessive force during the course of an investigatory stop.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.709" offset="1462447">If the county commissioners were setting this policy and they said, investigate the applicants carefully and don't hire ones with criminal records indicating violence, and somebody like the sheriff, for whatever reason, failed to follow it, we would say one instance does not convert that instance into county policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.453" offset="1557428">It's only when the policymakers know that it's not being carried out and they do nothing about it that we can say they become deliberately indifferent to it, and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1752.577" offset="7153901">The instructions required a finding of direct cause, and in the verdict form required a finding of proximate cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1764.826" offset="7202907">Direct cause, closely related to, affirmative link, moving forth, are the terms that this Court has employed to refer to the causation requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1774.643" offset="7242195">That's direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.474" offset="7245539">That's direct causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.494" offset="7249614">That is a common way for judges to refer to proximate cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.557" offset="7265810">And moreover, as a matter of law, the evidence here was not insufficient to establish that direct cause, because what we had here was precisely the constitutional deprivation that was predicted by the red flags that were up at the time that the county hired Sheriff Burns.</text>

            <text syncTime="1798.349" offset="7337072">If Officer Burns had gone out and enforced the law in a racially discriminatory manner, there's no causation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1814.862" offset="7403110">But here, the deprivation that occurred, the excessive use of force, was precisely the deprivation that was endangered, that was ignored when the sheriff ignored the red flags that were there right at the time of hiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.771" offset="7458698">Justice Scalia, I'm glad you referred to the statute, because it seems to me that the word policy is... that they're trying to use the word policy against us, and that's what I would say.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.812" offset="12902825">--Sometimes, Your Honor, the job description and the applicant behavior, the preemployment applicant behavior known to the county decisionmakers just doesn't match the job description.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.110" offset="12944099">You don't put child molesters in a first grade classroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.004" offset="12959668">You don't make them janitors at the elementary school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.013" offset="12967714">Maybe groundskeepers at the high school, maybe an assistant to the tax collector.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.646" offset="12982238">The same thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.106" offset="12988089">The job description of a police officer, as this Court recognized in Canton, as Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion noted in Canton, police officers are expected, by the nature of their job, to face recurring situations where there are clear constitutional duties regarding the use of force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.675" offset="13046290">Those recurring situations often involve stressful, tense confrontations with citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.781" offset="13074711">That's the job description.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.582" offset="13081921">You don't hire individuals... some persons are unfit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.184" offset="13092370">Recent, lengthy, lawless disrespect for law and order, immature, occasional violent behavior is a red flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.200" offset="13124448">It is highly predictive of the constitutional deprivation that in fact occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.231" offset="13140540">Again, if you've got a different constitutional deprivation, enforcing the law in a racially discriminatory manner, you don't have the causal link, but we've got all that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.698" offset="13174394">We've got the red flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.657" offset="13178261">We... also, I think the lack of hiring suits speaks well of the municipal policymakers in this country, that normally when they see that red flag they don't hire, or if they hire, they take some corrective measures subsequent to hiring, but... and again, that's all the deliberate indifference standard requires of persons to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.692" offset="13254434">The Federal district courts, Justice Scalia, have not been reluctant to grant summary judgment to counties if the county comes up with the least bit of summary judgment proof that they made an effort, that they paid attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.417" offset="13297274">This record in this case is devoid of that paying attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.380" offset="13313157">We ran his record, but then we didn't read it, but he had no felonies, as it turned out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.403" offset="13333219">That was the brunt of their case on the hiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.864" offset="13343041">With respect to the bad training, in the face of expert testimony that there was no formal departmental training, that the training was nonexistent in the county, the only thing they came up with was, well, he rode with grandpa a few times in the squad car and grandpa... in the terms of... in its testimony, pointed out the do's and don'ts of what to do, things to look for with the drunk drivers, possible causes, possible reasons to pull people over, and things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.195" offset="13472399">They didn't... the county didn't produce evidence of one single, solitary representative of the county that took Stacy Burns, despite Stacy Burns' lengthy preemployment record of behavior including violence, they didn't point to one county official that took him aside and said, son, let me tell you about the use of force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.237" offset="13536556">You're going to be facing situations where you need to use force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.549" offset="13549826">Here's when you can, here's when you can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.310" offset="13556827">The record is devoid of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.290" offset="13564768">And I'd like to point out that I think there's a blatant misstatement of the record on page 5 of petitioner's brief here claiming that Calclazier, which was grandpa, and Howell gave Burns general instructions on law enforcement, particular instruction on how to detect drunk drivers, on proper procedures to conduct an investigatory stop, and on methods of placing a suspect under the officer's custody and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.864" offset="13651077">That last, methods of placing a suspect under the officer's custody and control, the transcript cite, 580, simply doesn't bear that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.299" offset="13676781">No one told him about the use of force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.682" offset="13686394">Now, that's deliberate indifference, and it's going to be a rare case, a case like ours, where you can meet all those standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.247" offset="13716592">This is... in conclusion, I think this is a case ultimately about accountability, accountability of police officers on the street, which is enforced largely through the Fourth Amendment, accountability on the part of those ultimate policymakers that decide who to put on the street, yet in a Fourth Amendment arena, under Michigan v. Sitz, which is the drunk driving roadblock case, under--</text>
