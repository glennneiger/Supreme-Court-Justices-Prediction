            <text syncTime="13.601" offset="198439">Congress enacted title IV-D pursuant to its Spending Clause powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.434" offset="213799">That meant, under Pennhurst, that Congress had to unambiguously notify the States of any consequences of their accepting Federal funds so that the States could make an informed choice about whether to participate in that program, and under this Court's decisions in Suter, Congress could provide that notice to the States by unambiguously conferring rights in title IV-D that would be privately enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.769" offset="307108">Here, Congress has neither unambiguously conferred any rights upon respondents, nor unambiguously notified the States that title IV-D can be enforced privately by over 18 million title IV-D applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.776" offset="359144">Indeed, title IV-D says just the opposite, because when Congress offered the title IV-D partnership agreement to the States, it unambiguously deposited all enforcement authority in the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.653" offset="406687">Congress told the States unambiguously that the Secretary would enforce title IV-D, that the Secretary would apply a substantial compliance standard on a systemwide basis rather than an individual case-by-case basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="91.961" offset="511908">There are, however, some provisions in the statute here that are very specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.796" offset="539284">For instance, provisions that for, if the State is going to collect money for non-AFDC parents, that it will pay the money over to those parents very specifically and within certain time limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.288" offset="613159">Now, that's a pretty specific requirement, is it not?</text>
            <text syncTime="120.190" offset="624862">Do you say that no parent for whom the State has collected money under that provision would have a right to ask the State to pay it over if it were withheld?</text>

            <text syncTime="130.545" offset="666240">Justice O'Connor, that is an important difference here in this case, and that is, once the State actually receives the money, then the individuals would have a right, a property interest in getting that money if the State is wrongfully withholding it, but that is not a statutory right.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.516" offset="730083">That then becomes a constitutional right in their property.</text>

            <text syncTime="152.411" offset="753697">In any event, you would find at least some provisions are specific enough that by some route they could be enforced, would you not?</text>

            <text syncTime="164.429" offset="801763">As we envision title IV-D, it's a funding mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.471" offset="813988">The States gave up some of its rights in terms of domestic relations to the Federal Government in exchange for the money, so it's a contract between the sovereign interests, and what's happening here is we have the Federal Government coming in and trying to run part of the program.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.916" offset="1155670">We think that this case presents an excellent vehicle for the Court to reexamine Maine v. Thiboutot, but we don't come here today saying that that's the only way we can win.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.812" offset="1191301">We can set that argument aside, and we win on the fact that title IV-D does not unamiguously notify the States that there is any enforceable right in--</text>

            <text syncTime="282.855" offset="1275520">Maine v. Thiboutot says there is a right to enforce laws of the United States, and in connection with the question that Justice O'Connor asked you, I think you responded that there would be a claim... suppose the State collected the money and simply didn't turn it over.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.148" offset="1468617">No, ma'am, it would not be enforceable under title IV-D, because title IV-D again is a funding mechanism, and it's a funding relationship, and in order for the court... or in order for the parents to come in and say that they have an enforceable right, we need to make sure that they have one.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.559" offset="1546253">Here, there is no conferral of that right.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.262" offset="1677074">And it used to be when IV-D was first enacted that it was full compliance in 1975, and it continued that way until 1984, and Congress saw that no State had ever been able to comply at a full compliance standard, so Congress ratcheted it down from full compliance down to substantial compliance, and in the process notified the States that you didn't have to deliver service in each and every case, and that's the way that the Secretary also enforces it.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.696" offset="1770801">Well, it notified the States that it wouldn't take its enforcement measures such as reducing, what is it, the IV-A money or whatever, as a result of something less than a failure, or substantial compliance, but it doesn't follow from that that there is no individual right if in a particular case there is individual crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="432.054" offset="1872261">Well, in fact we think that it does follow that way, Your Honor, because Congress has developed a very comprehensive scheme in title IV-D.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.311" offset="1909250">You mentioned the fact that we would be losing title IV-A funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.052" offset="1920222">The rationale there is Congress wanted to have title IV-D operating full bore, at full speed, doing all that it could for the masses that it was designed to try to take care of, and in the process of then pulling off on an individual case-by-case basis various lawsuits we're... again, we have over 18 million title IV-D applicants across the Nation, and it will cripple the program if you allow these individuals to then come in and try to enforce this on a case-by-case basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="516.368" offset="2209554">We were told that the Secretary would then have the discretion to waive those liquidated damages when appropriate, and we could then go in and negotiate with the Secretary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3404.913" offset="13763722">Ms. Berzon was talking about looking at the substance of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.325" offset="13773335">If you look at paragraph 132(t), they complain about the extraordinary staff personnel shortages as the paramount cause of noncompliance with IV-D requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.751" offset="13811056">Then at 133, paragraph 133, they complain that Linda Blessing lacks the authority to direct the legal work of the AG's office, and at 134 they complain about the fact that title IV-D at the State level incurs problems with clerks in the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.450" offset="13869884">What they're asking for here is not a structural injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.732" offset="13882945">They're asking for a restructural injunction because they want a Federal judge to come in and tell Arizona how to redo its State government activities, and as the SG's representative just said, you need to sue the person who can grant the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.943" offset="13935817">Linda Blessing cannot redo what the Arizona legislature's budgetary concerns are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.775" offset="13959118">Linda Blessing cannot go out and reconfigure the lines of Arizona State government so that she can control the AG's office, and she cannot go out and rewrite Arizona government in terms of having to make the counties comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.616" offset="14018468">So it really boils down to, what's a Federal court going to do here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.188" offset="14032783">Is it going to duplicate what the Secretary's done, or will it be imposing new duties beyond whatever the Congress has passed?</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.400" offset="14057652">My second point gets to one that Justices Breyer and Ginsburg have raised, which is, how do I know which are which?</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.218" offset="14088894">The SG has just told us, well, we can look at them provision by provision, and some are and some aren't.</text>
