            <label>Justice Clarence Thomas</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="81646">This comes to us on a writ of certiorari to Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.536" offset="111739">The state of Oklahoma operated two programs by which prisoners were released before the expiration of their sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.533" offset="151759">One was parole, the other was called a preparole program, full name, Preparole Conditional Supervision Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.215" offset="190420">With respect to the traditional parole program, an inmate could be paroled if one third of his sentence had expired and if the Governor on the Pardon and Parole’s recommendation granted parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.500" offset="255622">With respect to preparole, the Board itself, could grant preparole when Oklahoma’s prisons were overcrowded and two, the prisoner had served 15% of his sentence or her sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.552" offset="323853">The conditions under which parolees and preparolees were released were essentially identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.265" offset="354678">Respondent was released on a preparole program after serving 15 years of a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.860" offset="385084">After five, apparently, uneventful months on the program, the Governor of Oklahoma denied him parole and he was promptly reincarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.246" offset="430537">He filed a state habeas corpus petition contending that his summary return to prison violated the procedural protection set forth in our decision in Morrissey versus Brewer.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.435" offset="479334">The State Trial and Appellate Courts denied habeas relief as did the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.885" offset="505143">The Tenth Circuit reversed concluding that preparole was enough like parole that respondent was entitled to the procedures set out in Morrissey.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.303" offset="546835">In an opinion filed with the Clerk today, we affirm.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.062" offset="561881">Preparole as it existed when responded was released was equivalent to parole as understoodin Morrissey.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.836" offset="592915">Indeed, it appears to have different in parole in name only.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.369" offset="611096">While the respondent’s liberty went on preparole was not unconditional, its limitations were can, if not identical to the limitations on a parolee’s release.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.872" offset="657071">In Morrissey we held that such limitations did not render a parolee's liberty beyond procedural protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.312" offset="686851">The opinion of the Court is unanimous.</text>
