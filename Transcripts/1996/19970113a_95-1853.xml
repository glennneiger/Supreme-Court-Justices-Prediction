            <text syncTime="957.356" offset="3972950">In our view, Justice Scalia, it comes from this Court's... the same basis that this Court stated in its different opinion in Fitzgerald, where they considered the immunity there, quote, a functionally mandated incident of the President's unique office.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.947" offset="4039301">That is, it arises from Article II.</text>

            <text syncTime="975.959" offset="4047347">Yeah, but to the extent that Nixon v. Fitzgerald involved some activity of the President that relates to his duties in office as President, that is an element that does not extend to this case.</text>
