            <text syncTime="18.483" offset="211846">Section 924(c)(1) of title 18 provides for mandatory jail sentences for persons who use or carry a firearm during the commission of certain offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.681" offset="260643">The Tenth Circuit in this case held that a sentence imposed under section 924(c) by a Federal district court may be made to run concurrently with a State sentence that the defendant is already serving.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.970" offset="309753">In our view, that is wrong for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.931" offset="321665">First and foremost, the language of the statute expressly forbids the imposition of a concurrent sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.697" offset="348728">Second, we think the court of appeals was wrong to imply a presumption that that prohibition refers solely to previously imposed Federal sentences, and finally, we think the Tenth Circuit was wrong to rely on a passage from the 1984 Senate committee report that accompanied the 1984 amendments to section 924(c).</text>

            <text syncTime="92.842" offset="509329">Just, what the statute refers to is running sentences concurrently, so is it okay to order its service after the expiration of a State court penalty?</text>

            <text syncTime="130.765" offset="660943">In this case, for example, in order to give effect to both the statutory authority to make the drug sentences concurrent with the State terms and to the statutory mandate that the 924 sentence be consecutive, the Bureau of Prisons would have to run the Federal drug sentence first, concurrent with the State sentence, and to run the 924(c) sentence last, consecutive to both State and Federal sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.855" offset="773374">There was an assumption in the court of appeals view that that would not be so because it gave what we think was inordinate weight to its view of the Senate committee report, but that is, in fact, an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.425" offset="831575">As a matter of the administration of the sentence, under section 3584(c), I believe, the Bureau of Prisons would treat the entire term imposed by the Federal court as a single administrative term that has several parts, and the part that would correspond to the Federal drug sentences in this case would be ordered... would be served concurrently with the existing State sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.770" offset="924989">The part that corresponds to section 924(c), as required by the plain language of the statute, would be made consecutive both to Federal sentences and to the State sentences that are already being served.</text>

            <text syncTime="265.075" offset="1198230">There is a case from this Court, Punsey v. Fessendon, which is at 258 U.S. 254, which encompasses a principle of primary jurisdiction, which is that each of the two sovereigns, State and Federal, may lend someone to the other Government so he may be tried, yet choose not to relinquish him for the service of the other sovereign sentence until they choose to, but under the statutes that we have, we would not take the view that we can break up a term of imprisonment and to tell the States how to do anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.788" offset="1337097">Mr. Estrada, I can agree with your... with the Government's position that the statute as written does not compel the States to make their sentences nonconcurrent, but why is it not the case that, after you've had the Federal sentence imposed and then a State sentence is imposed and the State says, well, we're not bound by this Federal statute, we will have this run concurrently with the Federal sentence, why does not the Federal sentence at that point become in violation of the statute, because it is now a sentence that is being served concurrently with another sentence.</text>

            <label>Mr. Miguel A. Estrada</label>
            <text syncTime="336.750" offset="1484950">That view might have some weight, Justice Scalia, if all there were to this statute would be the single clause, nor shall any sentence be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.327" offset="1523193">In context, it seems clear to us that the statute speaks to the duty of the Federal sentencing court at the time it imposed the sentences to impose a sentence based on the facts then existing, as is true with Federal sentencing statutes generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.757" offset="1576901">Therefore, given that the Federal court complied with that duty at the time it imposed sentence, any subsequent court that is not bound by that duty would be in no breach and, as a result, it would not be any violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.305" offset="1639177">Quite simply, if you take the language of the statute that says, notwithstanding any other provision of law the court shall not suspend the sentence or do any of these other things that a sentencing court would do, or, nor shall the sentence be made concurrent, in that context the natural reading is that the statute speaks to the duties of the Federal sentencing court as sentencing statutes usually do at the time sentence is imposed.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.187" offset="1762684">Then everything... then the result is simply going to turn on whose sentence is first.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.620" offset="1776372">If they do a State sentence first, then, in effect, you get the policy carried out when the Federal sentencing follows it.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.113" offset="1806361">If the Feds sentence first, in effect the State can negate the policy by saying everything we impose is going to run concurrent, including the premium, yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="428.219" offset="1850769">--There are two answers to that question, Justice Souter.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.913" offset="1861531">The first one is that the policy of the statute is that the sentence that is imposed under section 924(c) be made consecutive to any other sentence that the defendant might be serving.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.789" offset="1909074">It is always the case, where a sentence is made consecutive to another sentence, that any number of circumstances, for example, might change the first sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.668" offset="1952542">All that Congress can do is to say this is what the Federal court may make the sentence at the time of sentencing, and until and unless Congress chooses to go forward and to say that this is a national policy, not of instruction to the Federal courts about how to do their business, but of instruction also to the State courts about how to do theirs, the statute simply doesn't speak to the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1030.393" offset="4259468">One of the interesting facets of this case is that there is a general statute that governs whether Federal courts may impose sentences that are concurrent or consecutive, section 3584, which is quoted both in our opening brief and in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.042" offset="4322057">In our reply brief I believe the pertinent part is quoted at page 4, footnote 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.286" offset="4343059">That is the general residual Federal statute that deals with the question whether a Federal court may impose a concurrent sentence or a consecutive sentence, and the statute that respondents urge should be applied to them here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.326" offset="4395200">Now, the interesting thing about that statute is that even though it authorizes a concurrent term of imprisonment, it doesn't speak to State terms of imprisonment at all, so that if one were to take the rule of construction being urged for here, the logical consequence would be that there is no statutory authority for the imposition of a concurrent term of imprisonment.</text>
