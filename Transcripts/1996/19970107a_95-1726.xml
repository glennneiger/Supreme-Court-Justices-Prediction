            <text syncTime="13.190" offset="190441">This case involves the validity of commentary in the Federal sentencing guidelines that governs sentencing of career offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.017" offset="221788">Congress directed that the sentencing guidelines specify a sentence at or near the maximum term authorized for the identified categories of career offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.202" offset="266509">In Amendment 506 to the guidelines, however, the commission specified that the statutory sentence enhancements for recidivists shall not be used in calculating the maximum term authorized under the career offender guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.105" offset="334114">Thus, where a Federal narcotics law specifies that a first offender shall receive a sentence with a maximum of 20 years and a second offender shall receive a sentence subject to a 30-year maximum, the commission treats the maximum term authorized as 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.596" offset="412064">In our view, the commission's disregard of recidivist enhancements conflicts with the Sentencing Reform Act and is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.443" offset="443515">The starting point for analysis of this question is the text of the Sentencing Reform Act, which is set out in our brief in the appendix at page 21a, and it provides in section 994(h) of title 28 that the commission shall assure that the guidelines specify a sentence to a term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized for categories of defendants, and then it goes on to specify that the defendants must be 18 years of age or older and be convicted of a felony that was a crime of violence or a specified Federal drug offense and have two prior convictions of the same type.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.157" offset="594398">The text of this statute in our view is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.449" offset="607564">The maximum term authorized refers to the maximum, the uppermost limit of a range, thus, where there is a range consisting of two possible uppermost limits the higher of the two is the maximum.</text>

I don't think there's any dispute whatsoever... by statute of 30 years, which is 360 months, and under the career offender guideline as it existed prior to the time of Amendment 506, that would have produced a base offense level of 34, which is 262 months to 327 months, or 21 to 27 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="560.914" offset="2381383">Now, substantial is certainly a qualitative word that admits of a broad range of meanings, and the commission may very well have fulfilled a duty to impose a substantial sentence on the career offenders under the guidelines as it has written it, but Congress has singled out the career offenders identified in section 994(h), the categories of career offenders there, for different treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.809" offset="2468945">That treatment is perhaps the most specific direction that Congress gave the commission anywhere in the sentencing guidelines.</text>

            <text syncTime="1291.817" offset="5305007">One is, the same conviction is used under section 841(b) to enhance the maximum term and to send somebody into the career offender guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.804" offset="5344922">That form of alleged double counting, if it is double counting, cannot be eliminated by the Sentencing Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.479" offset="5371672">It must do that, because the law specifies that the same conviction may have the effect of increasing the maximum term and making somebody a career offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.827" offset="5413050">But the other possible double counting objection is that the same prior conviction is used both to enhance an offender's offense level and to increase his criminal history, and that that might have seemed to the commission to be double counting for some reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="1353.218" offset="5550558">What the commission could do in that situation is simply say, if you're a career offender, go to the statute books, find the maximum term authorized, and sentence within 10 percent or 15 percent of that maximum term, instead using the grid provided in the sentencing table for most offenders.</text>

            <text syncTime="1379.117" offset="5654212">In fact, there's no other provision that was handed to the Sentencing Commission to implement that is anywhere near as specific as this on how particular identified offenders are to be treated, and the commission could have quite easily said, sentence them all at their maximum.</text>

            <text syncTime="1403.735" offset="5752642">The... I mean, the choice is really between saying what Congress meant was where it says a first offender gets up to 20 years, up to, what they meant by this is, he gets 20 years, period, or what you're arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.915" offset="5813350">And one concern was, if you take what you argue, that really turns the power to decide what the sentence is directly over to the prosecutor, because in most of these cases you can't go beyond 20 years unless the prosecutor files a specific piece of paper, and that decision, which is totally the prosecutor's, is totally contrary to the whole philosophy of the guidelines.</text>

            <text syncTime="1444.510" offset="5915750">The impetus of the guidelines was to eliminate unwarranted disparity by different judges who have different sentencing philosophies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.375" offset="5939260">The guidelines do not and cannot eliminate prosecutorial discretion and, given that Congress has vested the prosecutor with the authority, as you say, to raise the maximum by filing a reply or pretrial notice of crimes, Congress has vested discretion in the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.244" offset="5998715">I don't think the commission can say that is an unwarranted disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.807" offset="6012926">That is a product of prosecutorial discretion which is an endemic and universal feature of Federal criminal law, and the Sentencing Commission was not given the task, which would probably be unconstitutional anyway, of attempting to eliminate prosecutorial discretion in the enforcement of Federal criminal law, and so I don't think that there's any argument there that the disparity is unwarranted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1540.940" offset="6301527">That was in the 1982 bill that passed the Senate but the Senate the next time, the next year rejected that and instead gave this more general instruction to the Sentencing Commission, putting this obligation under 994(h) in the context of all of the commission's obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.422" offset="6367460">And what the Sentencing Commission did here was looked at all of its obligations, including first and foremost under the statute to provide certainty and fairness and reducing unwarranted sentencing disparity, and the commission decided that the prosecutor having the ability to in effect determine the sentence by this 851 mechanism was something that would contribute to unwarranted disparity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1612.488" offset="6587724">That's the way the 851 mechanism has always worked.</text>

            <text syncTime="2119.841" offset="8617125">The defendant committed a crime that would have had a 20-year maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.634" offset="8632276">Because of his prior record and the Government's filing under 851, he now could receive a 30-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.180" offset="8658398">The guideline is based on the 20-year maximum, but if there are any aggravating factors in the case that make him a worse than normal offender... large amount of drugs, use of a weapon, a leadership role in the offense, or anything else that the guidelines don't consider which warrant a departure... the judge can impose a sentence above the career offender level, above 20 years all the way up to 30 years, so in fact it's the Government's view of the case that would dramatically alter the intended effect of an 851 filing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2203.590" offset="8952119">The judge also has to go through the regular routine rules of the guidelines... look at the amount of drugs, the use of a weapon, injury, leadership role... and if that comes out to a level 34 or 5 or 6, that's the sentence the judge must impose, not the level 32 that the career offender guideline points to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.773" offset="9020769">Secondly, if there are other aggravating factors that the guidelines don't take into account, the judge can decide under the standards in Koon that this is a case that warrants an upward departure, so level 32 isn't high enough because this guy is not only a career offender but he's got a criminal record a mile long, and therefore level 32 is not enough.</text>

I think this is the same point, but I thought one of the strongest arguments the SG made was in the very same statute where the sentencing guidelines were enacted into law, there... Congress enacted a provision that said 20 years for a first offender, being cocaine, or... up to 20 years, or up to 40 years for a second, okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.378" offset="10207251">Now, why would they have done that if, in fact, this provision that we're talking about is keyed to the first offense, because the provision keyed to the first offense would have given everybody, everybody who is the second offender the 20 years that's the max for the first offender?</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.322" offset="10283006">And your response to that is, oh, but there are some cases where you would have wanted to go higher, namely a case of a departure, or a case where the underlying substantive offense is in fact like distributing a pound of crack in a prison with a gun, so you get to level 36 or 38 anyway.</text>
