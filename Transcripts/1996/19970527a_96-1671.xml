            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="154754">We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1671, Frederick D. Raines v. Robert C. Byrd, and counsel have been advised, I believe, that you are to have 35 minutes each on a side.</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III</label>
            <text syncTime="13.558" offset="208984">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.593" offset="221105">The single most important point I want to make this morning is a point that goes both to standing and the merits, and it is this: the passage of the Line Item Veto Act does not alter the authority or the ability of Congress to require the executive branch to spend appropriated funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.756" offset="297696">After the act, as before, every legislative option about whether an appropriation should be mandatory or discretionary remains fully available to a simple majority of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.814" offset="345970">When the time comes to vote on an appropriations bill, the legal effect of each option, mandatory, discretionary, linked or unlinked, will be perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.920" offset="390378">Every Member's vote will be fully counted.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.121" offset="399156">The simple majority of Congress retains full authority to protect any item of spending from presidential cancellation.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.560" offset="428935">This point goes to the heart of the appellee's claim of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.797" offset="461850">Consider their best shot, I believe is the example with which they... they feature in the opening of their reply brief, an example where a Member votes for an ABC bill which might lead, they say, to the post hoc creation of an ABC law or an AC law.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.395" offset="544292">Suppose, they say, the items A, B, and C are aid to Egypt, to Jordan, and to Israel.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.150" offset="571250">A Member of Congress might well wish to vote for the delicate balance embodied in the entire package, but have objections to keeping any of the items if the others were to be stricken.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.172" offset="611374">The act converts a vote, they say, for ABC in toto into a vote for a three-item menu from which the President may select any combination that he alone prefers, and the Member is injured at the moment he must cast his vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.848" offset="670098">This is simply a profound misunderstanding of the nature of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.920" offset="694339">When the time comes for Congress to vote on the omnibus foreign aid bill it can, by simple majority, make any choice it wants about mandating or linking those funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.728" offset="749614">Congress can say with respect to the appropriation for each country that, quote, no funds under this act may be expended for payments to country A unless funds are provided concurrently to the other two countries, or Congress can vote to mandate all three, using the language it actually sets out in the bill for limited tax benefits by saying something like, section 1021(a) of the Empowerment Control Act shall not apply to provisions I, J, and E of this appropriations act.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="178.163" offset="867374">Well, it could do that all across the board, I suppose, General Dellinger, simply perhaps render the thing kind of a nullity if it incorporated that sort of a provision in every appropriations item.</text>

            <text syncTime="188.721" offset="909588">It could, of course, though we doubt that it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.089" offset="923067">We think that the act has important functions as a background default mode but it is... would not be at all surprising if particular projects were put forth at an appropriation and also with the notion that section 1021(a) should not apply.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="211.134" offset="999241">Well, of course, the President then could veto such subsequent bill and that would then require a larger vote of Congress to override the veto.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.108" offset="1047097">I mean, it does put them in a different position to that extent, perhaps.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="234.147" offset="1091296">Well, suppose Congress decides later on that maybe some type of appropriations shouldn't be subject to this line item veto, so they include passage in a subsequent bill saying that the Line Item Veto Act won't apply to a certain type of appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.993" offset="1182725">That, of course, has to go to the President for signature, and he then can veto that and that then would require enough votes to override that veto.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Walter E. Dellinger, III</label>
            <text syncTime="271.070" offset="1238940">--But in your example Congress passes the requirement that the provision be exempt from this provision only after it has first passed an omnibus appropriations act, but Congress is more likely to choose to do that with an appropriation it cares about in the process of passing the omnibus appropriations act, and that's not, you know, unfamiliar.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.868" offset="1338205">Congress in the very act that they use as an example provided that the assistance for Israel and Egypt shall be provided with the President's assurance that the level does not cause an adverse impact on the total level of military support, that the sum of $815 million available only for Egypt with the understanding that Egypt will undertake significant economic reforms, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.233" offset="1443636">That is to say, Congress is quite familiar with that process, so that I think if you looked at this in the context of a real case or controversy after the fact, you might well have seen that Senator Byrd or Senator Moynihan had moved to link the aid to Egypt, Israel, and Jordan, and had that rejected, 53-47, and then moved to make--</text>

            <text syncTime="1929.218" offset="7871534">The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 fundamentally alters the Federal lawmaking process by giving the President the new power of cancellation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.908" offset="7910300">This cancellation applies to traditional spending items; to new items of direct spending, such as entitlements, which includes the rights of individuals to food stamps, medicare, State and local governments to contracts... and of those that are increased; and to limited tax benefits, precisely the kind of private ordering that Solicitor General Dellinger just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.606" offset="8001102">And while I'm on that subject, if I may answer Justice Breyer's inquiry, this was a very important part of the legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.760" offset="8029732">We have prepared a legislative summary, which was submitted in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1990.340" offset="8116041">And we believe it's quite evident in this case that if there had been no tax benefit provision in the bill, there would have been no bill.</text>

            <text syncTime="2036.552" offset="8300883">Similarly, if the joint committee says there are no limited tax benefits, then the President may not cancel any.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.991" offset="8326692">But if the joint committee does not state either way, then the President may use his normal tools of interpretation to decide whether any of the tax benefits conferred come within it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3958.600" offset="15989138">Mr. Chief Justice, Justice Kennedy raised the question about irregularity in the legislative process as being an allegation that would give rise to standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.622" offset="16033232">I want to note that the Defendants in this case are the Secretary of the Treasury and Director of OMB.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.710" offset="16057578">If there is... we don't believe there was any defect in the internal procedures because the members' votes were counted and the bill was presented to the President and he complains about what the President does thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.418" offset="16096344">But if there were an actual deprivation of the right to vote, the appropriate suit would be against, I would assume, someone in the legislative branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.072" offset="16122989">It is not the case that when the President exercises his discretion to cancel in order to carry out deficit reduction that the provision has no legal force and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.194" offset="16163427">What the statute actually says is that the budget authority has no legal force or effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.996" offset="16186728">The Act... the provision continues to define the amount of money that, for Gramm-Rudman and pay-as-you-go purposes and sequestration purposes, the amount of allowable spending is reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.989" offset="16234689">Here you have a restriction of the President's delegated authority to cover one-third of the budget only for a period of 8 years, where he may draw upon the entire expertise of the executive branch in making a conclusion that it is better to allocate some money exclusively to deficit reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.533" offset="16308876">We believe that that broad congressional and executive consensus should be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.752" offset="16325699">Thank you.</text>
