            <text syncTime="20.195" offset="212131">Today the Court is presented with the question whether the qualified immunity defense is as powerful in State courts as it is in Federal courts, or whether its scope and its protection may vary among the States, or between Federal district courts and one State, and State trial courts in the same State.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.327" offset="296663">Thirty-six States are involved in this, between the amicus and the petitioners, because of the importance of the qualified immunity defense to the practical functioning of State government, and because of the value of this defense to the employees and officers of State and local governments throughout the Nation.</text>

            <text syncTime="120.950" offset="615148">My concern is that since these qualified immunity is designed to protect State officials I would think the Idaho legislature could probably extend the appeal right if it wanted to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2928.079" offset="11843621">I suppose another way of phrasing Justice Scalia's question is whether the appealability rule adopted in Mitchell is a construction of 1291 or a construction of 1983, and I suppose the answer's obvious because Mitchell wasn't even a 1983 case.</text>
