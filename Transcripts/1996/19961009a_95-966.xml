            <text syncTime="15.343" offset="203932">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="24.730" offset="241443">The minor children of the decedent in the wrongful death suit underlying this case have raised before this Court two independent and potentially dispositive legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.577" offset="280836">The first is whether the punitive damages that the children received in connection with the death of their mother are excludable from gross income as any damages received on account of personal injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.114" offset="327020">The statute on its face does not contemplate a distinction between punitive and compensatory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.789" offset="353665">The statute says any damages, a word that the United States frequently does not include in its quotations of the statute in its brief in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.327" offset="387834">Certainly, there was a longstanding... has been a longstanding understanding in tort law that there is a difference between punitive and compensatory damages, and this Court has often stated that Congress is presumed to have known the state of the common law when it enacts statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.636" offset="445094">Congress easily could have said only compensatory damages received on account of personal injuries should be excluded, but it did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.540" offset="476754">It said, any damages received on account of personal injuries should be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.122" offset="491069">In fact, when Congress has wanted to draw a distinction between punitive and compensatory damages it has expressly done so, for example, in the Federal Tort Claims Act, in which Congress precluded liability of the United States for punitive damages arising from the tortious conduct of its employees and, indeed, the IRS itself has at times read this statute in precisely the way we contend it should be read, to exclude any and all damages that are recovered in connection with a personal injury suit.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="114.221" offset="599425">Well, of course, you've now used the term, in connection with, but the statute says on account of, and it's my impression the Government's position is that punitive damages are not on account of the personal injuries.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stephen_r_mcallister" startTime="124.877" stopTime="329.434">
            <label>Mr. Stephen R. McAllister</label>
            <text syncTime="124.877" offset="642057">That is certainly the Government's contention, Your Honor, and we believe that's wrong for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.781" offset="661701">First of all, if you look back to the language of the statute as originally enacted in 1918, the substance of it has not changed, but the organization and the order has changed to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.846" offset="701930">The original provision in 1918 basically excluded accident or health insurance benefits or Worker's Comp benefits which the sentence then said, received as compensation for personal injuries, plus any damages received on account of personal injuries whether by suit or agreement, so that the statute itself, when you look at how it was originally enacted, it was a very odd way that Congress intended all of those things to be limited to compensation, to list certain things followed by the phrase, received as compensation for personal injuries, and then to go on and say, plus any damages received on account of personal injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.440" offset="840274">Furthermore, when this Court talked about the on account of language in its decision in Schleier recently the Court talked about whether the damages were attributable to an underlying personal injury, or whether the underlying personal injury affected the amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.589" offset="904849">The Court concluded that liquidated damages under the Age Discrimination and Employment Act did not satisfy either of those conditions, but punitive damages are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.887" offset="938077">Punitive damages do satisfy those conditions in a couple of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.089" offset="950929">First of all, as this Court recognized recently in BMW v. Gore, punitive damages both the availability and the appropriate amount in most jurisdictions depends on considerations of the underlying harm, the nature of the harm, the extent of the harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.568" offset="1016862">Gore recognizes as much when it talks about the first factor, for example, the reprehensibility of the conduct, talks about personal injury is more egregious than property damage, a physical injury in essence is more serious than perhaps a dignitary injury, and most jurisdictions, if not all, recognize those concepts as far as punitive damages are concerned in determining whether they're appropriate and then what amount is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.796" offset="1109754">Furthermore, it's the rule in virtually all jurisdictions, again, if not all, and the traditional rule is that there can be no award of punitive damages in the absence of proof of actual harm and generally in the absence of proof of actual damages, that there needs to be an actual compensatory award made before punitive damages are allowed at all, and for those reasons, even within the attributable-to language and the affecting the amount language that this Court endorsed in Schleier, the punitive damages in this case satisfy that test in a way that the liquidated damages under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.216" offset="1243396">Furthermore, punitive damages, as we've suggested, do sometimes serve compensatory purposes, so even if the Court is to view it in that fashion, historically that was clearly the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.114" offset="1291043">We've cited the Black's Law Dictionary from the time period when this statute was enacted, which clearly contemplates that in some situations they serve a compensatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.220" offset="1323435">But even more recently, in the 1996 amendment to this statute Congress recognized that sometimes what the States call punitive damages may, in fact, serve compensatory purposes, and that recognition is in the new section 104(c), in which Congress has said in the new 104(a)(2) punitive damages are no longer excluded, except, it says in subsection (c), in a wrongful death suit where only punitive damages are allowed, and the jurisdiction of which I'm aware is Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.260" offset="1435553">There may be a couple of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.602" offset="1440986">Congress has said in that circumstance those punitive damages are excluded, apparently because--</text>

            <text syncTime="342.136" offset="1511099">The 1996 amendment does not appear in any of the original briefs because it was passed by Congress in August and signed by the President in August, after the briefing had been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.593" offset="1544954">Part of the text is included in the supplemental briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.156" offset="1559164">I don't know if 104(c) is actually included in the supplemental briefs, but that text was all extremely recent and after the merits briefing was basically completed in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="407.584" offset="1772846">It's certainly not, Your Honor, in terms of resolving the statutory interpretation issue present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.798" offset="1789773">All I'm trying to suggest is that in the 1996 amendment Congress itself is recognizing that sometimes punitive damages may serve compensatory purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.486" offset="1824464">The example it recognized is the Alabama situation, where in a wrongful death suit all the plaintiff is allowed to recover, the only thing is punitive damages and Congress said, even though those are labeled punitive damages by the State of Alabama, we want them to be excludable under section 104.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.442" offset="1908265">The '89 amendment was prospective, but it's important, because what the '89 amendment does, it can be read two ways, but what the lower courts have strongly endorsed is the view that what Congress understood at the time was that all punitive damages as of 1989 were excludable under section 104.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.514" offset="1980572">There was a debate between the House and the Senate as to how they might narrow the scope of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.307" offset="1995723">What they ultimately ended up with was a provision that says the exclusion shall not apply in any case not involving physical injury or physical sickness, and that narrowed the scope, but it remained the case that punitive damages received in a physical injury case are excludable and in fact the House--</text>

            <text syncTime="612.875" offset="2594031">The United States... and to go back to Justice Scalia's point about interpreting the statute as a whole, the United States suggests that the title that goes with the statute, compensation for injuries or sickness, suggests a more limited or narrower scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.234" offset="2651500">The problem with that argument is that title was not present in 1918, and there's no suggestion that there was any debate by Congress when that title was added as part of apparently the codification process that they were in any sense altering or changing the original scope of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.076" offset="2710851">The operative language has remained the same from 1918 onward.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.799" offset="2725688">What has happened, though, is the tax laws were codified in what was originally one sentence, drawing the distinction between accident or health insurance benefits and Worker's Comp benefits on the one hand received as compensation and any damages received on account of personal injuries.</text>

            <text syncTime="780.031" offset="3262661">It would have been extraordinarily easy for Congress to have said, as compensation, which it did with the rest of that statute when it first enacted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.777" offset="3293695">So that yes, the companions around that provision perhaps do suggest a narrower focus, but certainly in the original provision, and the substantive language itself has not changed, a broader construction is suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.864" offset="3337998">And again, without going back through the history, when you simply look at these provisions today, that one sits in the middle of all these other what appear to be purely compensatory provisions, but our view is, you cannot fully understand that provision or give full effect to its language without looking back to the history of it and following through how it has come through the first codification, the recodification, and how it ended up where it is today.</text>

            <text syncTime="858.884" offset="3578116">In our view, the way to deal with that is that the Court should look at the language itself, and look at the history, and we believe when you do that, that the language is no longer so ambiguous, so that it is not a choice of two interpretations competing, which we simply have no way to choose between one and the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.515" offset="3648647">In fact, the history strongly suggests that one interpretation is the correct interpretation, the broader interpretation, but I do recognize the existence of that default rule as it's been characterized at times.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.684" offset="3693264">But we're suggesting that when you look at all of the surrounding evidence here, the things that Justice Souter has talked about, the contrast in the language, the history of the provision, where it came from, and how it got to be where it is today, that really only one conclusion makes sense here, or at least is the stronger conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="926.854" offset="3849998">We're simply saying Congress demonstrated that it understood the statute, the language of it, the meaning in 1989, that all punitive damages received in a personal injury suit were excluded, and that's--</text>

            <text syncTime="1019.721" offset="4221460">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.605" offset="4232954">In 1918, Congress created an exception to taxation for the traditional tort victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.637" offset="4257091">When asked to extend this same exception to the hybrid statutory victim this Court in Burke and Schleier determined that the exception was not to be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.646" offset="4301081">The enactors in 1918 did not know about the hybrid statutory rights, statutory remedies for age and gender discrimination that would be created in Federal statute some 50 years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.712" offset="4353430">Those Congressmen in 1918 wrote the statute for what they understood and what is before the Court today, the common law tort claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.649" offset="4389166">This Court has never before been asked to apply this statute to common law tort claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.604" offset="4416960">Instead, the recent cases of Burke and Schleier have asked this Court to apply the exclusion to the hybrid Federal statute with legislated remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.220" offset="4459383">Those remedies are based primarily on lost wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.974" offset="4474429">Because the original statute allows only the exclusion for tort or tort-like claims, and because the hybrid statutes provided for contract-like recoveries, this Court in Burke determined that there was no tort-like claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.425" offset="4540258">In Burke, the Court tested the type of claim by a review of the type of damages that could be awarded under the Federal statute to determine that the claim was not tort-like but instead more in the nature of a contract claim, a contract for wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.315" offset="4603788">In Schleier, the Court was once again asked to name the type of claim, and again resorted to the analysis of the type of damages to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.789" offset="4637747">A claim is known by the type of damages it produces in these hybrid Federal statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1192.480" offset="4912451">Before Schleier, every court which had found the statute plain had found in favor of the taxpayer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1206.489" offset="4968457">It is apparent that section 104(a)(2), out of its context, out of its original context, is ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.406" offset="5000118">One third of this Court was struggling with the issue of whether the Court... excuse me, the statute was ambiguous or not.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kent L. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="1578.044" offset="6454720">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.276" offset="6475618">Two terms ago, in Commissioner v. Schleier, this Court held that an award of damages that is punitive in nature rather than compensatory does not constitute damages on account of personal injury within the meaning of section 104(a)(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.797" offset="6537685">That holding applies directly to this case, and is compelled by the text, structure, history, and purpose of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.931" offset="6566315">The text of the statute provides an exclusion from income only for damages awarded on account of the personal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.426" offset="6596199">It does not, as petitioners contend, encompass simply any recovery obtained in an action in connection with a personal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.352" offset="6627964">Indeed, that precise contention was rejected by this Court in Schleier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.865" offset="6646041">In Schleier, the Court said that whether the underlying cause of action is on account of, or rather, whether the damages are received in connection with an underlying cause of action that is a tort-type action for personal injuries is not, in the words of the Court, the beginning and end of the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.837" offset="6717930">Instead, as the Court emphasized in Schleier, each element of the recovery must be on account of the personal injury for the statutory exclusion to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.265" offset="6759621">Only damages that compensate for a loss and are attributable to it are on account of the injury within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.549" offset="6788774">As this Court said 40 years ago in Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass, damages for personal injury are by definition compensatory only, and do not include punitive and other ancillary recoveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.919" offset="6842168">This Court's decision in Schleier provides two applications of the statute in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.823" offset="6865887">The Court in Schleier did not doubt that age discrimination effects personal injuries to the victims of the discrimination, but the Court pointed out that the two remedies provided by statute for that discrimination, back wages and liquidated damages for willful violations of the act, did not compensate for those personal injuries, were not attributable to those injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.288" offset="6951674">They therefore were not on account of those injuries within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.211" offset="6967347">The... in... sorry, I've obviously lost my train of thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.696" offset="7009352">Because the damages are not awarded on account of the injury, they're not within the scope of the statutory exclusion from income which, as this Court has said on many occasions, must be narrowly interpreted and applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.466" offset="7060447">Now, punitive damages in the decisions of this Court have never been held to be compensation, and they are not awarded on account of an injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.441" offset="7092317">Punitive damages, as this Court has often said, are a civil fine awarded to punish and to deter reprehensible conduct, they are not compensation for the injury itself, and I think it's important to point out that the Kansas cases on which petitioners now rely for the first time in their reply brief make exactly that same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.116" offset="7174968">In Brewer v. Homestead Production Company, at 200 Kansas, page 96, the Kansas supreme court states, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.770" offset="7205584">"In this State exemplary damages are not regarded as compensatory in any degree. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.415" offset="7232229">That is exactly the statement that the Court made in Molzof, that this Court made in Molzof and in Gertz.</text>

            <text syncTime="1779.300" offset="7259709">What if we... what if this came up from a State where the supreme court had said something else about... something more favorable to the petitioners about the nature of exemplary damages?</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.657" offset="7305163">--Sometimes, if you will, writing it in academic fashion, courts look at the fact that these moneys go to the plaintiff and say, perhaps they serve a compensatory purpose in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.785" offset="7353646">The money goes there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.796" offset="7357721">But no court to my knowledge has held that a jury may award punitive damages as additional compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.942" offset="7386351">What courts instruct juries, and what juries do, is they award punitive damages as deterrence and comp... and punishment for particular types of egregious misbehavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.281" offset="7431700">The Kansas supreme court is a classic example of that, because the Kansas supreme court said, well, punitive damages are not compensatory in any degree, but a jury may consider the amount of actual damages in deciding what punitive damages are appropriate to accomplish the State's independent objectives of punishing and deterring the conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.413" offset="7516232">As the Fifth Circuit said just last year in Estate of Moore v. Commissioner, which is not cited in our brief but which I've mentioned to petitioner's counsel... it's at 53 F. 3d at 716... what the Fifth Circuit said in Estate of Moore is that this fact does not make a punitive award a compensatory one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.556" offset="7592718">It does not, as the court said in that case, change the fundamental truth that punitive damages are awarded only on account of and in proportion to the defendant's wrongful conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.524" offset="7640679">Thus, that court and all but one of the courts of appeals have concluded that punitive damages being awarded on account of the reprehensible conduct and not as compensation to the injuries do not come within the statutory exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.876" offset="7698044">The one court that reached a different conclusion, the Horton case in the Sixth Circuit, relied solely on a rationale that this Court flatly rejected in Schleier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.099" offset="7734929">What the Court said in Horton is that any recovery obtained in an action based upon a personal injury is exempt from tax for that reason alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.066" offset="7770769">In fact, in Horton the Court said, that is the beginning and end of the analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.540" offset="7788741">In Schleier, although this Court didn't cite Horton, the Court referred to that same contention and said, that is not the beginning and end of the analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1941.453" offset="7908382">I mean, isn't that one explanation of Schleier that doesn't apply here?</text>

            <text syncTime="2036.289" offset="8287680">The Court also acknowledged in Schleier, twice in a footnote and once in the text, that if the compensation obtained under the act was on account of those injuries, it would be within the statutory exclusion, but what the Court quite clearly held was that an award that is punitive in nature rather than compensatory cannot be said to be on account of the injuries, which is what five of the circuits have concluded when the same issue has been presented in the context of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.577" offset="8396872">The text of the statute in our view, and I believe in the Court's view in Schleier, compelled that conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2075.007" offset="8442534">The title of section 104 is, Compensation for Injuries and Sickness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.760" offset="8457580">Each of the subsections of the statute relate solely to compensation for different types of injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.464" offset="8480359">None of them provide an exemption from tax for any recovery that's not compensatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.268" offset="8499585">The history of the act is fairly clear on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.820" offset="8509825">Each... several of the courts of appeals have described in detail the fact that this statute is derived directly from the 1918 opinion of the Attorney General holding that recoveries for personal injuries are akin to a return of capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.759" offset="8569594">They merely make the taxpayer whole for a personal loss, and would not represent income as that term was then understood.</text>
