            <text syncTime="156.213" offset="765642">In other words, if a group of children or a child cannot read at whatever the grade level, this money is used to provide special training, but it seems to me that what that boils down to is teaching a child to read, or teaching a child who can't add how to do math, and I don't see what the distinction is between the supplementation and simply the school's normal mission to teach reading or to teach math, or whatever the secular subject is.</text>

            <text syncTime="215.167" offset="1001371">That is, the... it is not unfamiliar throughout Federal law for Congress to have requirements, as title I does, that the funds should be used to supplement and in no case supplant the level of services that would in the absence of this funding have been available.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.697" offset="4719536">New York City schoolchildren who are poor and educationally disadvantaged are not getting the Title 1 educational help they need because of Aguilar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.218" offset="4753600">Many are receiving remedial education that is less effective than it could be, and the expensive alternatives mandated by Aguilar are taking money that could be used on educating poor, educationally disadvantaged children and spending it on buses and leased sites.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.812" offset="4812009">In the 1993-'94 school year there were 260,000 students who received title I instruction in New York City.</text>

            <text syncTime="1188.976" offset="4896646">Those children received instruction either on buses or with computer-assisted instruction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1202.818" offset="4952026">Each of these, according to the Secretary of Education, is not an effective method and it makes it difficult to give a quality education.</text>

            <text syncTime="3478.999" offset="14056744">--Well, the question, Your Honor, is, did you apply... did you adopt a principle that overrules the cases in which the Court has held that... it's sometimes called massive aid, or funding of religious schools, is unconstitutional as in Grand Rapids, as in Meek v. Pittenger?</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.412" offset="14138351">I don't think so, and the word that was used in the Court's opinion in Zobrest was that the aid that was given to that student was only attenuated aid.</text>

            <text syncTime="3520.474" offset="14222674">The line that this Court has itself drawn in Ball and in Zobrest is that a State may not in effect subsidize the religious functions of the parochial schools by taking over a substantial portion of their responsibility for teaching secular subjects.</text>
