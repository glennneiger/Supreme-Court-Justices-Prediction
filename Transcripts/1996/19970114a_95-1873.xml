            <text syncTime="575.860" offset="2442528">Now, let's say we get that far in our analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.452" offset="2456948">Is that failure jurisdictional or is it simply a prudential concern we might have?</text>

            <text syncTime="588.027" offset="2491220">Well, we, of course, believe it would be a prudential concern, because we believe that the Alabama supreme court did not want to look at Shutts v. Phillips Petroleum because in our situation we had objectors who were nonresidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.323" offset="2572409">If you look at Shutts, and if you... the most narrow reading in Shutts would have declared at the very least there would have been opt-out rights granted to nonresidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.569" offset="2613369">For example, if I could refer you to the joint appendix in volume 1, on page 238 and 239 you would see, for example, at the trial court level there were notice of opt-outs filed, for example, at the... in the Barbour County Circuit Court and citing Phillips Petroleum v. Shutts.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.719" offset="2733950">There were also pleadings filed, for example on behalf of Mississippi residents saying that the fraud had occurred in Mississippi, and they were... and the policies were delivered in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.557" offset="2781284">So we believe that the reason that the Alabama supreme court did not, in fact, want to look at Shutts even in the most narrow sense is because opt-out rights would have surely had to be granted in that type of situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1456.886" offset="5966655">In your view, is the addition of the words punitive damages... if you go to each of the plaintiffs, by the way, and say is it important to you, they say, sure is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.030" offset="5995181">It might be a lot of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.553" offset="6001346">So is the simple addition of the word, punitive damages to a class action that plainly is not an opt-out class suddenly converted, making it an opt-out class, or making it a no-opt-out class?</text>
