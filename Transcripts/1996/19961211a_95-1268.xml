            <text syncTime="1132.063" offset="4672138">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.251" offset="4712889">Traffic stops present special dangers to police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.462" offset="4729816">They're faced with an unknown situation, an unknown area, they're faced with little knowledge, if any knowledge of the occupants of the car, and they are vulnerable to attack not just from the driver but from the passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.781" offset="4779031">In Mimms, this Court found that these safety concerns justify a per se rule that an officer in a valid traffic stop can order the driver to exit the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.166" offset="4820618">We submit that Mimms should be applied to passengers for three reasons on the issue of order to exit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.571" offset="4846218">First, the driver... the officer has to focus on the driver in implementing the traffic stop and in securing the information with respect to a license or to the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.609" offset="4886342">He cannot monitor the passenger's conduct at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.863" offset="4903374">The focus in Mimms was on the inordinate risk, and the Court made specific reference to the inordinate risk as an officer approaches a person seated in the car, and the Court specifically said that the officer had no reason in Mimms to believe that the officer was suspect as to foul play, so it was the focus on a person seated in the car that created the danger.</text>

Sharpe and numerous other cases from this Court would probably permit about a half-an-hour, case-by-case basis, on how long you could detain, which means, Your Honor, that making the passenger get out would have the functional equivalent, particularly if there was a bright line and the police could do anything in any case, allowing the passenger to be detained, even though it started as--</text>

            <text syncTime="3276.226" offset="13248869">Justice O'Connor, that is correct, which is why I stated earlier that this Court could fashion a line between the one end of the spectrum that we would like to see, which is, you need reasonable suspicion in each case, and the other end of the spectrum that the State of Maryland asks for, which is, you need nothing and anything, to say, the line is as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.661" offset="13334551">Our existing case law applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.183" offset="13344686">Any reasonable suspicion of any wrong activity or officer's safety, of course the officer can then take reasonable steps; in addition, take all of these hypos that we discussed today and defer that back to the law enforcement agencies for them, based upon their expertise, just like you did in Sokolow, just like you did in Wells, for them to say, based upon their experience as experts in the area, what are the kinds of situations that truly create a heightened caution that would permit some type of activity, notwithstanding the failure to have any facts in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.285" offset="13485016">And in fact that's what this Court did when this Court ruled unanimously in Wells that it was not proper to do an inventory search when there was simply no guidance from the agency to the individual officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.963" offset="13535798">This Court referred it back, and since then agencies have had no problem examining those scenarios and coming up with situations just like agencies have since Sokolow in the profile cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.812" offset="13583132">What are the kinds of situations, based on its experience as a law enforcement agency, that makes it reasonable in the following circumstances, following types of situations, the following is likely?</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.929" offset="13627645">This Court has consistently given deference to administrative agencies, their expertise in the area, and we are not suggesting that be any different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.434" offset="13661604">What we are suggesting, Your Honor, is, when you weigh out the interest of law enforcement and safety and you weigh out individual rights, you can't give standardless, unlimited discretion to individual officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.322" offset="13713222">The best you should do is to give that discretion to administrative agencies.</text>

            <text syncTime="3479.199" offset="14060755">But of course, Your Honor, these standards that would be made by agencies, just like the profile cases today, would, of course, be subject to review as to whether they were unreasonable and extended too much or not sufficient guidance to individual officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3559.395" offset="14381539">Since Mimms, with the authority upheld for the police across the Nation to order the driver out, and since some 25 jurisdictions have believed that Mimms also conveys to the passengers, we do have data that shows that the percentage of deaths in traffic incidents have been reduced from about 30 percent to somewhere around 13 percent, so there is an inference that Mimms and its progeny within the States has, in fact, worked.</text>
