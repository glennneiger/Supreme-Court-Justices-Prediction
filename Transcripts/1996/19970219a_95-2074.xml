            <text syncTime="18.425" offset="228652">This case is not about religious liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.916" offset="242549">This case is about Federal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.098" offset="255297">It is about the ability of the United States Constitution to restrain Congress, the branch most likely to be controlled by interest groups and by opinion polls, from engaging in a hostile takeover of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.108" offset="315379">The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was passed in an emotional and heated response to this Court's determination in Employment Division v. Smith, is a brazen attempt to reinterpret the Free Exercise Clause and to impose that reinterpretation on the courts, on the States, and to shift the balance of power between church and State dramatically in favor of the churches.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.453" offset="400747">This is the worst of legislative overreaching, which violates the fundamental structural constitutional guarantees, the separation of powers, Federalism, and separation between church and State.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.351" offset="456336">The constitutional bedrock was laid long ago in Marbury v. Madison, where this Court rejected explicitly the notion that the legislature may alter the Constitution by an ordinary act.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.781" offset="510043">The Constitution, this Court said, is either superior, paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means, or it is on a level with ordinary legislation, like other acts, and is alterable--</text>

            <text syncTime="148.858" offset="750370">Well, Justice O'Connor, I think the test to understand whether or not section 5 has been appropriately used by Congress is the text of the amendment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.145" offset="795509">It states, the Congress shall have power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this article.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.463" offset="896760">Well, Katzenbach v. Morgan I think went further than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.347" offset="912329">I mean, it said that even though Lassiter had said that literacy tests were okay, now literacy tests were not okay in New York for Puerto Ricans because of what Comgress had said.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.572" offset="961230">--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, Lassiter stated that as a facial matter a particular literacy test was not unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.630" offset="1001459">The Congress went back and made a factual determination that as they looked out over literacy tests they came to the conclusion that they were almost always evidence of invidious discrimination, and on the basis of that factual determination the Court in Katzenbach v. Morgan upheld Congress' decision to ban literacy tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.624" offset="1085469">It is the difference between the fact-finding capacities of the legislature and this Court's ability to be the final arbiter of the meaning of the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.612" offset="1189331">I'm not sure... I mean, they can always go back and build a bigger record.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.605" offset="1329348">There must be some kind of proportional fit between the means and the end to be appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.162" offset="1487545">The purpose, patent on its face and ripe in the legislative history, was to bring into high level of scrutiny that conduct which was constitutionally appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="392.311" offset="1724215">In the civil rights cases, this Court made clear there must be some colorable evidence of some State wrongdoing that justifies prophylactic activity.</text>
