            <text syncTime="18.083" offset="213072">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="24.576" offset="238985">The question that is raised in this case is whether a particular provision in a Maine statute dealing with property tax exemptions for charitable organizations is or is not constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.356" offset="290185">The challenge to the statute is laid upon the commerce Clause in its dormant or negative aspect, that is, without the existence of any relevant congressional action under the proviso a charity that is otherwise entitled to receive the exemption is denied that exemption if, to use the words of the statute, it is conducted or operated principally for the benefit of persons who are not residents of Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.874" offset="404184">Now, the petitioner is such a charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.195" offset="417454">It was denied the exemption on those grounds, and that really is the core of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.501" offset="442741">Now, the remaining facts are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.800" offset="447965">They're not contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.742" offset="451727">I can summarize them quite swiftly.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.354" offset="458101">The matter was disposed of on summary judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.905" offset="468341">The petitioner is a Maine corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.756" offset="483701">Its only activity is to conduct a summer camp for children in the town that is now Harrison that is the respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.633" offset="523198">It is dedicated to serving Christian Science families.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.487" offset="538662">There are not a great many Christian Science families in the State of Maine, and accordingly it recruits and advertises outside the State broadly, and it serves principally people, children who are not residents of the State of Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.176" offset="597385">Indeed, during the three tax years in question about 95 percent of the campers that were served at the camp came to the camp from other States, States other than Maine.</text>

            <text syncTime="135.571" offset="682963">The purpose, Justice Scalia, which is asserted... and let me go directly to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.683" offset="711488">The purpose that is asserted to be the purpose on the face of this statute is a quite reasonable purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.117" offset="733222">It is to confine the dedication of the resources of the State, of the community, to the benefit in these particular areas of residence of that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.384" offset="766241">Now, that purpose is as legitimate as the purposes that were served in the waste disposal cases that you've had before you, the purposes of encouraging private industry, all the purposes that are listed in the opinion of the courts in Chemical Waste, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.707" offset="843563">There's nothing at all sinister about the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.347" offset="854117">The question, as in almost all of these cases, is whether or not the means that were adopted to achieve that purpose impacted improperly upon interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="202.845" offset="952128">It seems to me that this... that is, the granting of a tax deduction to charities, it's just like giving charities the State money.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.029" offset="984834">I don't know that those other States involve... those other cases involve that.</text>

            <text syncTime="233.623" offset="1075217">In terms of its being a... the equivalent of a tax expenditure, your first point, that, as I believe you yourself have indicated in your concurring opinion in the West Lynn Creamery case, is true of all exemption and credit cases, and the Court, as you pointed out, has always regarded tax exemptions and credits as being the equivalent of taxes themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.541" offset="1174901">So that if you take a case that I think is closely on point, the Darnell case, involving a property tax again, exemption upon lumber that was produced in the State that was involved, an exemption for that lumber but not for others, that amounts to a tax expenditure, or, if you wish, a subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.362" offset="1254208">In the Bacchus case, the exemptions that were granted there to the liquors that were produced in the State of Hawaii were in fact tax expenditures on behalf of those people, of those manufacturers.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.707" offset="2079573">If you were to take that view and distinguish between the real estate and personal property taxes, for example, because after all personal property does move, then you would have an awkward situation here, because part of this tax was personal property, and part was realty.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.097" offset="2133072">My first point is that that makes an awkward distinction in this particular case, as it would in any case.</text>

            <text syncTime="519.001" offset="2216768">Now, if they could escape the effect of Darnell simply by transforming the form of the tax, they could then levy the tax on the real property, the warehouse in which the lumber was stored.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.226" offset="6729578">Before addressing in detail the three arguments in my brief which I use to support the conclusion or the results achieved by the Maine law court, I want to address two fundamental points which I think should be addressed at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.794" offset="6775867">The first one is that there is no Federal constitutional right for a nonprofit organization to receive a tax exemption from local property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.558" offset="6810976">The second fundamental point is that State legislatures have great latitude in deciding who should be tax exempt and who should not be tax exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.233" offset="6849637">This is especially true, I believe, when we are talking about taxation from real estate tax, or exemption from real estate taxes which really are a quintessentially local matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.321" offset="6889970">I would suggest to you that that discretion of State legislatures extends to being able to determine what benefit Maine residents in this case are to achieve... are to receive in return for this tax exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="2075.534" offset="8442897">And Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote first that the exemption is really the equivalent of a subsidy or even a cash grant... those are the words that were used, cash grant... and that really the Government has no obligation to subsidize the First Amendment activities in that case of the petitioner.</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Dempsey</label>
            <text syncTime="3195.580" offset="12923002">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.371" offset="12934182">I just have two comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.803" offset="12939929">The... one of the questions that Justice Scalia raised in terms of how old this statute is raises another question, and also your last question about property taxes, and that is, why hasn't this Court ever seen a case like this before, and the short answer is that legislatures have not passed statutes like this before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.314" offset="13005967">Now, there have been scores, thousands of statutes that we don't know anything about, but we have examined, and the respondent has, the statutes on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.339" offset="13034074">We have discovered one in the State of Michigan that can be considered comparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.400" offset="13050270">The respondent has turned up three more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.483" offset="13058629">We deny that they're comparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.754" offset="13067720">But in any case, if this statute is not absolutely unique, it is almost unique, and that says something, because the policy of the Commerce Clause doesn't have to do just with economics, it has to do with interstate comity, and we suggest that this unbroken, almost unbroken pattern of behavior by the legislatures says something about how the States feel to meet the demands of interstate comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.038" offset="13156850">Now, the last point is Justice Connor's comment and Justice Scalia's comment, I hope it goes without saying, because I didn't say it, that our case is rooted in the basic premise that this statute is facially discriminatory against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.988" offset="13216618">Justice Scalia, I think you're absolutely... I started with this notion in the petition of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.191" offset="13241487">If you apply all the ordinary canons that this Court has established over the years dealing with these cases, the other side has got to lose, in my judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.678" offset="13279416">The only way out is to create an exception for... I wouldn't say charities, nonprofit organizations comparable to the market participation or the subsidy charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.335" offset="13318078">Now, we've advanced all the reasons that we think that that would be an unwise move on the part of the Court, but that really I think is the issue.</text>
