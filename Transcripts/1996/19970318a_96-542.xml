            <text syncTime="13.230" offset="206128">We are before the Court on the question of whether an Alabama county is liable for the unconstitutional actions of its sheriff where the county's voters select and elect the sheriff, where the county's Treasury funds the conduct of the sheriff, and where the sheriff's jurisdictional authority is limited to the status of the county as one of Alabama's 67 counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.717" offset="304035">At the outset, I think in thinking about this issue it's important to acknowledge that no one disputes that the sheriff is a final policymaking... a final policymaker in the area of law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.995" offset="353145">The Eleventh Circuit found that the sheriff... Alabama law gives the sheriff in Alabama final policymaking authority in the area of law enforcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="111.865" offset="600681">That is, what happened in this case is that there is evidence... and again, the evidence is not developed... that the county has elected to take out a policy which may cover the sheriff's conduct here, and while we think that's relevant in deciding the county's interest in this matter, it's not dispositive of whether the petitioner will have access to county funds, and it's certainly not required under Alabama law.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.182" offset="833903">That is, we can recover from the sheriff, but our position is obviously that where the sheriff was able to effect Mr. McMillian's, the petitioner's arrest, and to put him on death row pretrial, and to suppress evidence that was withheld from the prosecution, he did that because he had the power and status given to him by the county.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.057" offset="1105472">The Eleventh Circuit held that because the sheriff's law enforcement authority is not shared with some other county official, that the county is somehow not liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.902" offset="1140789">We think that's a misconstruction of this Court's opinion in Monell and its progeny, and this Court has never held that only local legislative bodies can make policies for which a county is liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.291" offset="1186347">Just in the same way that a mayor can create a policy that the city council is not responsible for, the city council does not control, he nonetheless makes a policy, if it's final, that would subject the city to liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1466.472" offset="6019104">So it's not a novel notion to hold some other entity, other than the local legislative body, as a final policymaker who can create policy that makes... that binds the municipality or the county liable for that unconstitutional conduct, particularly where here the ability to do that is dependent on the power, the authority, the status, and the resources provided by that municipality.</text>

          <turn speaker="bryan_a_stevenson" startTime="3561.339" stopTime="3712.648">
            <label>Mr. Bryan A. Stevenson</label>
            <text syncTime="3561.339" offset="14398559">I'd like to at least suggest that the Court not accept this notion that the sheriff is a State policymaker under the law that's been provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.605" offset="14443594">There are two provisions which point to the sheriff having some State identity, the constitutional provision, which we contend is a label and is at best ambiguous, because the label says, sheriff for the county, and then the State tort law judgments, which we contend are not relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.476" offset="14507124">The rest of Alabama law repeatedly refers to the sheriff as a county officer, and the Eleventh Circuit did not hold the sheriff makes policy for the State precisely because, as Justice Stevens suggests, that's kind of a difficult notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.297" offset="14566369">He is not like the Department of Public Safety employees who are subject to some State hierarchical command.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.951" offset="14589044">What the respondent then tries to say is, because there is this removal authority, somehow the State exercises control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.584" offset="14615584">The removal authority in Alabama is applicable to all county, municipal, and State officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.828" offset="14636482">They can remove a mayor, a county commissioner, a city commissioner, and in that sense does not help us resolve this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.752" offset="14668247">The third thing is that we have identified in our brief at pages 23 and 24 all of the State law enforcement provisions that identify State law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.269" offset="14706281">In those provisions the sheriff is never referenced, never included, which I think again gives good evidence as to why the sheriff is not a State policymaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.795" offset="14740345">And then finally, if we're not going to accept election and funding and status as a county official as the governing rationale, then the county commission's not a county official either, because their relationship to the county is also dependent on three factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.903" offset="14796769">They're elected, they're paid, and they're identified as county officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.736" offset="14812129">Nothing else in Alabama law makes them any more of a county representative than the sheriff, and in those respects we think it's not only appropriate but necessary to hold that county liable when its resources empower somebody like the sheriff here to engage in the kind of unconstitutional conduct against the petitioner that could not have happened but for those resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.359" offset="14890601">Mr. McMillian would not have spent 6 years on death row unless the county gave the sheriff the power to arrest, to stop, to withhold evidence, and to do the other things that violated his rights, and under those circumstances it's certainly our position that the Federal remedy ought not turn on the personal sovereignty of the wrongdoer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.601" offset="14963640">It ought not turn on that, because that wrongdoer's conduct was not made possible solely by that wrongdoer's initiative or conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.056" offset="14993419">Unless there are further questions, I'll rest.</text>
