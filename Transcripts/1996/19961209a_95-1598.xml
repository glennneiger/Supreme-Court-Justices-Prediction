            <text syncTime="9.667" offset="183986">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.701" offset="200078">During the past decade, Oklahoma, like many other States, has experienced a serious prison overcrowding problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.745" offset="224215">In an attempt to deal with this crisis, and at the same time to meet the goals of incarceration, the Oklahoma legislature has had to come up with some innovative programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.919" offset="256920">One such program is the program at issue here today, the pre-parole conditional supervision program.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.172" offset="277923">Ernest Harper was placed on this program after serving 14 years of a life sentence for first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.906" offset="300910">He was reclassified to a higher security level when the Governor of Oklahoma denied his parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.710" offset="324107">The Tenth Circuit found that because Mr. Harper had been serving his sentence outside the physical boundaries of a prison, that his program was like parole, and that he was entitled to the full protections of a Morrissey v. Brewer hearing before reclassification.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.850" offset="384711">We believe the Tenth Circuit erred in one major reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.643" offset="399862">The Tenth Circuit failed to consider the true nature of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.085" offset="413655">The Tenth Circuit's approach to the program was really very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.327" offset="430582">The Tenth Circuit found that because this was a program in which a prisoner was serving his sentence outside the four walls of the prison, that it was like parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.183" offset="462034">It is really very different from parole in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.734" offset="476244">First, I think what we need to do is look at the nature of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.498" offset="491291">You told us that in Sandin, and you had told us that previously in Meachum v. Fano and other cases, and when we look at the nature of the program, we have to consider several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.483" offset="527235">First, we have to consider the purpose for which the program was instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.826" offset="540610">We have to consider the function of the program, how it operates within the State, and this program, unlike parole, does not function as a program to reintegrate people into society.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.623" offset="587735">It functions as a program to alleviate prison overcrowding.</text>
