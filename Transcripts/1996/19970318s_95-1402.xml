            <label>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy</label>
            <text syncTime="11.696" offset="128290">In this case Commissioner of Internal Revenue versus the Estate of Hubert I have written an opinion which announces the judgment of the Court in a case involving the federal estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.575" offset="171862">The issue concerns the proper computation of the marital deduction and the charitable deduction and both of these are deductions to operate, to reduce the size of the taxable estate when the decedent estate is required to pay federal estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.233" offset="254514">This matter was complicated by will contest and contested probate proceedings but the problem can be stated this way:</text>
            <text syncTime="50.468" offset="283353">Suppose the will establishes a charitable trust and a marital deduction trust and also provides that the expenses of administering the estate are to be paid from the assets or the income of the assets which will be allocated to those trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.354" offset="342912">Are the marital and charitable gifts reduced by the amount of those expenses?</text>
            <text syncTime="69.856" offset="360989">That is the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.736" offset="368512">Everyone agrees that the deductions must be reduced to the extent principal of the trust are used to pay estate expenses and the regulations and statute are clear on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.544" offset="419712">The issue before us is whether or not the gifts must also be reduced if the income is used for this purpose but the principal amount of the gift remains intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.624" offset="456074">The Tax Court ruled that in some cases, such as the one before us, where the income is substantial, no reduction is required even where some of that income is used to pay the estate expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.377" offset="511036">The Court of Appeals agreed and affirmed the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.751" offset="524515">We also agree and we affirm the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.298" offset="538726">The controlling regulation says that the amount of the deduction must be reduced if the requirement to pay expenses is a material limitation on the right to receive income.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.114" offset="581985">Not every case in which some income is diverted for this purpose presents a material limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.898" offset="605077">The Commissioner's insistence on a dollar-for-dollar reduction of the deduction in every case where some income which used to pay expenses is inconsistent with the controlling regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.125" offset="646037">The opinion announcing the judgment of the court is joined by the Chief Justice and Justice Stevens and Ginsburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.192" offset="674249">Justice Oâ€™Connor has filed a concurring opinion joined by Justices Souter and Thomas; Justice Scalia has filed a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Breyer. and Justice Breyer has filed a separate dissenting opinion.</text>
