            <text syncTime="84.427" offset="478288">In Rodriguez-Barajas, Judge Easterbrook explained that the Attorney General's under no compulsion to disregard that initial fraud, and that any limitation on that has arisen out of the Attorney General's exercise of her discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="146.326" offset="725928">They have to be the relative... the parent, son or daughter or spouse of a citizen or a permanent resident alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.373" offset="762082">They also must have presented themselves for entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.766" offset="775665">They have to have a validly, facially valid document, and they have to be otherwise admissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.723" offset="827492">Now, looking at that pool of applicants, the Attorney General has to decide who amongst that she should exercise her discretion to give a waiver to, and our submission is that it's certainly proper for the Attorney General to favor a person who has been law-abiding since their initial entry over someone who's perpetrated a series of frauds.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.185" offset="909412">We would also submit, Your Honor, although it has not come up in the typical kinds of cases that have come before the board, if, for example, the entry fraud was intertwined with violence, for example, we certainly think the Attorney General in her discretion could take that into account.</text>

            <text syncTime="296.174" offset="1325282">What's the function of that sentence, other than to circumscribe or control the discretion of the AG?</text>

            <text syncTime="364.229" offset="1597582">There is some fraud at entry that doesn't involve fraudulent documents or labor certificates.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.237" offset="1705625">If they had an independently based fraudulent document, that could be a ground of inadmissibility, and it would not be waived because it would not directly result from their fraud, and I think what the statute was trying to get at was that any of the grounds of inadmissibility at the time of entry that directly result from the entry fraud are also waived.</text>

            <text syncTime="3024.948" offset="12240390">Number 1, at the time of entry, is he within this classification of having committed this fraud, so he commits this one particular fraud, and he's warranted with it and it becomes an individual part of his new identity... there's just no way he could shake that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.358" offset="12290023">So when the person applies for his social security card he puts down on the form he's married.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.652" offset="12307264">When he applies for... when he submits his income tax returns he says he's married, and I'm sure he put down he was married to Mary Wong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.437" offset="12334327">All these are incidental aspects of his having assumed this new identity in coming to America, and not some separate independent fraud that has no relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.842" offset="12376018">If he committed other frauds, of tax fraud, for example, then he would be deportable on those independently, and so we're not talking about a denial of a waiver in those cases, but the fact that he's deportable on some other ground.</text>
