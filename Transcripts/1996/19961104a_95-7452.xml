            <text syncTime="384.562" offset="1674980">Justice Ginsburg, the formula was adopted in 1983 under the Sentencing Reform Act, and that formula was the sentence of the Court minus the gain time equals the actual sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.059" offset="1716985">In this particular matter, Florida statute 921 authorized any and all gain time to be deducted from the actual sentence imposed, and in 1985 and 1986 there was an overcrowding problem, there's no question about that, and that overcrowding problem continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.190" offset="1777485">The contention or speculative nature of these credits doesn't really impact the fact that the effect of the '92 act totally and retroactively increased the measure of punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.009" offset="1908724">I've gone over the statute as you've provided it to us in the lodging, the statute that was in effect at the time of the offense, and it's not clear to me from reading that statute whether any reduction that did not result in the release of a particular prisoner would have survived the termination of the emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.186" offset="2005482">It is not clear to me from the statute, for example, that if your client got a 30-day reduction at some point because there was an emergency during his incarceration, but he was not released as a result of it because the reduction didn't get him down to that point, it's not clear to me from the statute that the reduction would have sort of remained on the books, if you will, as a permanent reduction in his sentence once the population had dropped down and that emergency was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.007" offset="2128779">And I guess my question is, isn't that another reason for saying that under the statute as it existed when he committed his offense it is at best speculative whether he would have obtained the kind of long-term permanent reduction benefit that you are claiming he has been denied improperly here?</text>
