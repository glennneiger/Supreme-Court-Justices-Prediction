            <text syncTime="1864.236" offset="7594511">First of all, with regard to the lump sum payments, clearly the antialienation provisions, once they've been paid out of the plan, don't apply, and there's a whole line of jurisprudence that sets that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.447" offset="7655324">But what's I think very important conceptually to understand, and this Court has spoken to that in the Mackey case and also in the Fort Halifax case, is there's a distinct difference between State laws that deal with benefits and those that deal with plans, and that the preemption clause is not designed to preempt State laws that deal with benefits, and that makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.583" offset="7759919">If you preempted the law that dealt with benefits, you could never get to defined rights, because those laws would have been preempted, so you couldn't have a QDRO.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.858" offset="7792937">Everything would end up in Federal court if you preempted the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.150" offset="7806103">So the remedy to deal with laws that are troubling, State laws that are troubling, are the antialienation provisions, and some cases have said that you preempt laws through the antialienation provisions, which doesn't make a lot of sense either, and I hope that I'm answering your question.</text>
