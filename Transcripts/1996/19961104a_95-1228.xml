            <text syncTime="27.080" offset="248389">The issue in this case is whether section 1014 of title 18 requires the Government to establish the element of materiality in order to obtain a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.851" offset="307531">Section 1014 prohibits any person from knowingly making any false statement or report or willfully overvaluing any land, property, or security for the purpose of influencing any one of a number of covered financial institutions in any application, advance, discount, purchase, purchase agreement, or a number of other listed transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.655" offset="402721">The text of the statute does not require proof of a materiality element.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.201" offset="428843">Notwithstanding the absence of that explicit element, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in this case concluded that an element of materiality should be implied into the statute in order to prevent it from being applied to what it viewed as trivial misstatements.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.291" offset="505225">Our contention is that that holding is incorrect, and that section 1014 does not require proof of materiality, for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.000" offset="548066">First, the text of the statute does not require proof of materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.103" offset="564471">Second, the history of the statute shows it to be a consolidation of a number of provisions, the vast majority of which did not require proof of materiality, and third, the Eighth Circuit's policy concerns are misguided in light of the statutory requirement of proving that the individual knowingly made a false statement and that he did it for the purpose of influencing the institution.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.324" offset="1313349">The text of section 1014, which is set out at pages 2 and 3 of our brief, does not require any explicit proof of the materiality of the false statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.972" offset="1359952">It has three elements.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.918" offset="1395792">It requires that the defendant know that the statement is false, and it requires that the statement must be made for the purpose of influencing the institution with respect to one of a number of enumerated financial transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.108" offset="1456500">In contrast to the deliberate exclusion of any materiality element from this statute, Congress has enacted a number of other statutes that deal with the problem of false statements that expressly require proof of materiality, perhaps the most prominent being the perjury statutes, 18 U.S.C. 1621, and 18 U.S.C. 1623, both of which explicitly require proof that the false statement be material to the proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.921" offset="1663808">What the court said was the materiality of the statement or representation alleged to be false or concealed is not a matter with which you are concerned, and should not be considered by you in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="628.604" offset="2654476">Well, Justice Scalia, we... I certainly agree that the instruction is not correct as we understand section 1014 to be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.260" offset="2689167">The question is then whether the particular error of the judge instructing the jury that it should not be concerned with materiality is sufficiently harmful as to warrant overturning this conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.846" offset="2731485">This case is actually, I think, a... proof that the purpose-to-influence element can readily be established without inferring that from proof of actual materiality of the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.565" offset="2790313">Here's how the purpose-to-influence element is established in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.528" offset="2806195">These respondents were engaged in a... the business of leasing copiers, with an integral agreement that they would service the copiers.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.586" offset="2846424">They had an arrangement with one bank where the bank knew about that integrated agreement and said, you... we will buy these agreements from you, cash them out for you, but we will require you to set up a reserve account to protect the service part of your contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.904" offset="2907655">The respondents needed more money.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.278" offset="2917163">They went to another bank who also knew about the integrated agreement and it said, we want the same reserve account.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.830" offset="2943390">At that point, respondents said, that's not going to give us enough money, we don't want the reserve account, so they entered into this conspiracy to break this integral agreement into two separate pieces of paper and presented to the banks that are the victim banks in this case, only the lease, not the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.503" offset="3018100">And I think that from that sequence of events alone, a jury was virtually compelled to infer that the false statements about this nature of a contract were for the purpose of influencing the banks, but if that wasn't enough and compelling in itself, one of the coconspirators was a cooperator with the Government and testified explicitly that's why we all did it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1139.179" offset="4696834">A second kind of omission could occur in a case like this one, where a party has one integrated agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.994" offset="4728076">I lease you the copier, I service it, but artificially divides the agreement into two parts, gives the bank the lease agreement, withholds the service agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.981" offset="4760050">That I think also could be colloquially described as an omission or a concealment, but it really also is a false statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.025" offset="4784187">The contracts in these cases that the respondents drafted said, this is the entire agreement between the parties, the lessee has responsibility for service, in fact the lessee did not have responsibility for service, and it wasn't the complete agreement between the parties, so in those kinds of cases I think we're really talking about false statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.934" offset="4851792">Now, a third kind of omissions case, I suppose, could be purely the omission of information that might be of interest to a bank, such as, I go in and I apply for a mortgage, and I don't tell the bank that I've previously been declared bankrupt twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.964" offset="4907903">That's not covered by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.206" offset="4920860">Now, another kind of statute might want to try to cover that, and there are statutes that expressly cover concealing or covering up material facts, and those statutes would apply perhaps to such a scheme, depending on whether the Government had proven all it needs to prove in a concealment case, but that's not a violation of section 1014.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.410" offset="5005705">Now, in this case I think the parties in the court of appeals used the words concealment when they really meant false statement, and the district court's opinion rejecting the respondent's rule 29 motion in this case, which is contained in the record, although not in the materials that this Court has available to it in the briefs, very clearly said that the contracts the respondents claim are literally true, and the Court said the contracts without the addenda are not, in fact, literally true, they are false statements and affirmative misrepresentations in the lease as submitted to the banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.603" offset="5146453">So this case does not, I believe, contain a true example of what might be described as an omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.308" offset="5181353">Now, the trial court did, as Your Honor points out, instruct that it has to be a concealment of a material fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.052" offset="5204340">In our view, the correct understanding of the statute is first doesn't apply to naked omissions, and second, to the extent that it does apply to omissions as I've described, they don't have to be material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.949" offset="5247913">What needs to be shown is that the individual engaged in those particular false statements for the purpose of influencing the bank.</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.465" offset="5457937">And then perhaps in a case such as I've described where the list of liabilities is incomplete, the court might explain at that point that's what's meant by the false statement in this case, but there isn't any requirement of materiality.</text>

            <text syncTime="1525.783" offset="6243178">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.267" offset="6253105">I would like initially to address some of the matters that were brought up during questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.280" offset="6277242">First of all, it was very highly contested in the trial court, and we actually briefed it on appeal, as to whether any of these statements that the Government said constituted a violation of a conspiracy to make a false statement to a bank or the substantive violation under Count 2 were in fact material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.059" offset="6340354">I'd like to simply indicate very briefly that with respect to the statements made to O'Bannon Bank and Bank IV that we had testimony that in fact the lease agreements that did provide that a lessee would have the responsibility for the maintenance was in fact literally true, and was done and presented to the banks in that fashion with their knowledge, at least in part as to a separate agreement, because the banks wanted to be not held responsible for those obligations under the second agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.931" offset="6471802">With respect to the issue of the signature by the individuals here before the Court or their wives, we had two positions on that, one of which was, it was not required under Federal law, therefore, as a matter of law, not material, and there was a timing issue, timing issue meaning they didn't require that until after there were in fact some purchases by the bank of the income streams from these leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.665" offset="6562708">I'd like to also point out that the Government had the opportunity in the lower court to make an issue as to whether or not section 1014 required a... was material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.702" offset="6602936">It is true under the Ribaste case under the Eighth Circuit as we tried the case, materiality had been held by that court to be in fact an essential element of the section 1014.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.699" offset="6646927">However, as the Government has pointed out, there was the Cleary case in the Second Circuit, and the Government elected not to make an issue of that in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.145" offset="6680677">In fact, materiality... the issue of materiality permeates this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.220" offset="6700948">There are substantial references to the issue of materiality, including a direct statement that the statements that were made to these banks were in fact material, not just omissions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2962.627" offset="11990639">I might also add that in the Williams case, which this Court decided when it set out the elements and the Government to some extent relies upon, in fact, made reference in the trial court to instructions that did, in fact, require materiality, and the Court didn't comment on that one way or the other, so I don't think Williams is a good case for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.579" offset="12062424">I don't really think, to be honest with you, as I look at this history, that they really considered it one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.192" offset="12084889">There's just nothing there to indicate that, and I think that was a reason why we have so many circuits that say that in fact materiality is an element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.168" offset="12120729">The one case of Cleary in the Second Circuit is not as strong for the Government as it urges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.692" offset="12138806">It's certainly on its face for the Government, and we don't disagree with that, but they at some point say in any event materiality is for the jury... or, not for the jury, it's for the court, so there is some language to indicate that perhaps they don't have that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.540" offset="12186244">In candor, in another statutory section, I believe Section 287, the Second Circuit has found that materiality is not an element when it's not in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.585" offset="12218427">I might also say that the Government in this case, in terms of the posture in which this case is here, I don't think that it is for them to say at this point, given what they did in the trial court, to actually have preserved this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.627" offset="12290629">It is not a case... that is, Gaudin and whether or not materiality is an element... that will cause a great deal of difficulty for this Court or any other court in terms of collateral consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.885" offset="12339635">The law is pretty clear that these matters would have to be preserved in the trial court and, given the status of the law at the time, I don't think that's a serious concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.850" offset="12375475">But beyond that, I think that in terms of whether or not this Court would even attempt to say that these folks that were tried in the lower court in fact were not prejudiced.</text>
