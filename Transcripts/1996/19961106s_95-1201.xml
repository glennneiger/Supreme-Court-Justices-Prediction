            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="9.049" offset="118160">This case comes to us on appeal from a three-judge District Court for the Northern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.347" offset="143343">Monterey County, California is subject to the federal preclearance requirement set forth in Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.586" offset="176257">As a jurisdiction covered by Section 5, the County may not enact or seek to administer any voting practice different from the practices in effect on November 1, 1968 without first obtaining approval of either the Attorney General of the United States or the District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.207" offset="254833">Between 1972 and 1983, Monterey County, in fact adopted a series of ordinances that merged nine separate judicial districts into a single countywide judicial district.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.493" offset="315960">The County did not submit any of the consolidation ordinances for federal preclearance under Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.022" offset="346053">The appellants in this case sued the County in the Federal District Court for the Northern District in 1991, alleging that the County had not obtained Section 5 preclearance for its judicial election scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.979" offset="397880">The three-judge District Court ordered the County to obtain federal preclearance of the challenged ordinances but the County did not submit the ordinances to the appropriate federal authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.579" offset="448244">Instead, the County began to work with the appellants to develop a new judicial election plan that they believe would be less retrogressive than the at large countywide election scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.915" offset="497667">The State of California intervened and opposed the party’s plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.929" offset="513654">It claimed that they unnecessarily violated the California Constitution as well as certain California statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.227" offset="546882">In 1994, the three-judge District Court finally decided to adopt as an interim measure, one of the plans proposed by the County and the appellant even though the plan was inconsistent with state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.265" offset="602993">In 1995, this Court issued its decision in Miller versus Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.409" offset="623578">Shortly after that, the three-judge District Court here ruled that Miller casts substantial doubt on the constitutionality of its interim plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.440" offset="659731">In 1995 then, it ordered the County to conduct judicial elections under an at large countywide election plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.754" offset="688988">In essence, four years after filing the complaint, the District Court ordered the County to hold elections under the very same scheme that the appellant had originally challenged under Section 5 as unprecleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.904" offset="741547">In an opinion filed today, we reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.051" offset="754190">The District Court’s order that the county conduct elections under the unprecleared judicial election plan conflicts with our decision in Clark versus Roemer.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.667" offset="792642">It was an error for the District Court to order elections under the at large countywide election plan that had not been precleared by an appropriate federal authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.170" offset="834647">Congress intended that only the Attorney General of the United States or the District Court for the District of Columbia has on the discriminatory effect or purpose of an election change.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.736" offset="880936">This congressional choice in favor of specialized review limits the role of the three-judge Federal District Court, and the court may determine only whether Section 5 covers a contested voting change whether Section 5’s approval requirements were satisfied, and if the requirements were not satisfied, what temporary remedy, if any, is appropriate?</text>
            <text syncTime="227.203" offset="990755">The goal of the three-judge District Court facing a Section 5 challenge must be to ensure that the covered jurisdiction submits its election change to appropriate federal authorities as expeditiously as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.230" offset="1046866">A county has not discharged its obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.626" offset="1060449">The requirements of federal scrutiny should besatisfied without further delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.720" offset="1080825">The judgment is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.973" offset="1085840">The case is remanded for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.278" offset="1095036">The decision is unanimous.</text>
