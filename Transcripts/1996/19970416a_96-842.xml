            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="9.857" offset="180825">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="12.770" offset="192423">Information is the lifeblood of the securities markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.003" offset="209350">Markets thrive on legitimate efforts to acquire, analyze, and use information, but the deceptive acquisition and use of information in securities trading serves no legitimate purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.881" offset="264939">Respondent's securities trading involved just such deception.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.195" offset="282180">Respondent is a lawyer whose firm was entrusted with the confidential plans of a client that had planned to make a tender offer for the Pillsbury company.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.632" offset="327946">While posing as a loyal partner in his law firm, respondent misappropriated that information in breach of his fiduciary duties to the firm and his client and reaped personal profits in virtually risk-free trading in Pillsbury stock and options.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.633" offset="395865">By engaging in that form of deception in connection with his trading, respondent violated three prohibitions of Federal law: section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, section 14(e) of the Exchange Act, and the mail fraud statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.625" offset="467858">Now, the misappropriation theory under section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act posits that a fiduciary or other person with a similar relationship of trust and confidence commits deception on the legitimate owner of information if that fiduciary or other agent misappropriates the information by using it in securities trading, contrary to the view of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="113.474" offset="595231">I mean, suppose the defendant here had instead come clean, and he told his superiors in the law firm that he was going to use this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.704" offset="652178">Then he would not be posing as a loyal employee any more, and it would have been okay.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael R. Dreeben</label>
            <text syncTime="148.517" offset="735456">That's absolutely correct, and the reason why that is significant is that section 10(b) prohibits deceptive devices and contrivances.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.963" offset="769207">It requires deception.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.635" offset="775894">The misappropriation theory does involve a breach of fiduciary duty, but the distinctive factor about that breach is that it is a deceptive breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.440" offset="815182">It involves, just as the facts did in Carpenter v. United States, an agent entrusted with information by a principal under the understanding between the parties that the agent would not use that information for any personal gain without obtaining the principal's agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="226.789" offset="1048508">The daughter has no obligation to disclose.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.992" offset="1061360">Correct, Justice O'Connor, and the answer to that is probably not, although there has been litigation about whether in particular circumstances a family relationship is sufficiently imbued with a business context that there is a duty that runs to it, but I accept the general thrust of your hypotheticals.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.045" offset="1141608">There are forms of improper conduct that section 10(b) does not reach, and the reason why section 10(b) does not reach them is it is a statute that is framed to reach fraudulent deceptive activity in connection with securities trading.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.603" offset="1263757">--The connection, Chief Justice Rehnquist, lies in the fact that the misappropriation does not occur until the lawyer uses the information as the basis for his trades.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.173" offset="1310046">It is that very information which drives his participation in the market and allows the profits to be reached... reaped by him.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.671" offset="1536057">Congress did not pass a statute that says, it is unlawful to commit fraud on the purchaser or seller of securities.</text>

            <text syncTime="363.250" offset="1594363">It passed a law with a broader phrase, in connection with a securities transaction, because the very aim of this section was to pick up unforeseen, cunning, deceptive devices that people might cleverly use in the securities markets--</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.640" offset="5159972">Congress also knew that there is a great opportunity for insider profiting because the information about a tender offer is necessarily circulated to many professionals in advance of the tender offer who then have the opportunity to go out and trade on it, and as a result of its recognition about the dangers of fraudulent and deceptive practices and tender offers, Congress was not content to rely simply on section 10(b) but drafted a new and different antifraud provision which is backed up by regulatory authority that gives the SEC the power to define and prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, manipulative conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1340.585" offset="5503744">First, the regulatory authority that is found in section 14(e) was modeled on a different section of the securities laws, not section 10(b), but section 15(c), which dealt with regulating broker-dealers, and in that context Congress had specifically given the SEC the authority to define fraudulent practices because it wanted to establish a higher standard of obligations and duties than would otherwise be imposed by the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.634" offset="5619936">It adopted that language in section 14(e) after the SEC had previously exercised its power to create new obligations that weren't found in the common law, unless it's reasonable to infer that Congress expected that authority to be exercised in that fashion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1417.897" offset="5812929">But there certainly is language in that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.917" offset="5825050">I think footnote 11 indicates that SEC can't go more broadly than the terms of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1429.744" offset="5860368">I think the footnote, read in context, says that the mere promulgation of the regulatory authority for the SEC, the addition of the sentence that gave the SEC regulatory authority, didn't change the meanings of the words in the first sentence, but the Court expressly recognized that Congress had authority... that Congress had given authority to the SEC not only to define acts or practices as are fraudulent but to prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent them, and the Court explicitly said there that the SEC could prohibit nondeceptive conduct as a means reasonably designed to prevent fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.250" offset="6022431">So the Court in Schreiber I think did acknowledge that the SEC has very vast regulatory power in order to protect against the abuses that Congress had identified in the tender offer context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.347" offset="6074781">Rule 14(e) 3 does that by establishing a flat ban on trading by persons who come into possession of information about an upcoming tender offer when they know that it was received from the bidder or somebody acting on its behalf, and that flat ban serves two valuable purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.961" offset="6161194">The first is that it protects shareholders who are going to be facing a tender offer, or who actually are facing a tender offer, from not having adequate time and adequate information to make a decision whether to buy, sell, or hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.554" offset="6227545">It also prevents collusion between the bidder and other parties operating in the marketplace that has not disclosed to the marketplace, as the Williams Act requires, from buying up stock from unsuspecting shareholders in the target company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.883" offset="6284910">A second purpose that is served by 14(e)3 is the prevention of fraudulent activity that involves, as this case did, the deceptive acquisition of information from the bidder or law firm's accountants, investment bankers that represent it, and it thereby serves to prevent that kind of fraud from occurring, which is a very great danger, and which involves a very great danger of not being detected, because this is in essence a crime that involves surreptitious activity that is not often easy to bring to light.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.397" offset="6434957">So 14(e)3 carves out in the tender offer context very special heightened rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.192" offset="6462124">It carves out and creates in the tender offer context a disclose or abstain from trading obligation, but it does not apply, as section 10(b) does, to the rest of the universe of securities transactions in which the misuse of information can pose very serious threats.</text>

            <text syncTime="1640.914" offset="6705063">The SEC drew on the regulatory authority it was given to impose a duty to make disclosure, and second, the SEC's rule prevents violations that are akin to the misappropriation violation that occurs under section 10(b) by ensuring that when someone has material information of this character, they simply may not trade, even when there is no proof of a breach of fiduciary duty and deception in that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1795.806" offset="7324583">The basis of that conviction was a set of legal theories that are not incorporated into the text of any statute, that have sown confusion among the courts, and that provide no guidance to participants in the stock market.</text>

            <text syncTime="1835.590" offset="7483721">On August 12, 1988, the Wall Street Journal reported that a British firm called Grand Metropolitan had put its hotel subsidiary, Intercontinental, up for auction to raise money for an acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.155" offset="7570030">On August 18, just 6 days later, a financial columnist named Dan Dorfman, announced on the Cable News Network that people close to Grand Metropolitan... and that is a common synonym in the trade for people inside Grand Metropolitan... are telling people in the street that Grand Metropolitan is interested in acquiring Pillsbury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.233" offset="7678281">Also on August 18, a broker called respondent to advise that he'd received a $9 million order to buy 250,000 shares of Pillsbury stock for a customer in London.</text>

            <text syncTime="2999.665" offset="12139995">Insider trading was supposed to be governed by section 16(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.427" offset="12155042">Katie Roberts worked very hard to get insider trading under 10(b) more than 30 years after the statute was passed by saying it depends upon nondisclosure as between participants to a transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.978" offset="12221288">This Court went along with that in Chiarella, but not further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.561" offset="12243649">What the Congress needs, if it wants to get passed... and I can even conceptually do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.645" offset="12271966">I can... in my mind I can say, misrepresentation... deception can encompass nondisclosure when there is a duty to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.952" offset="12309164">I can't get beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.794" offset="12316583">So if the Congress wants within the framework of 60 years of law to get beyond misrepresentation or nondisclosure constituting deception when there's a duty to speak, it should pass a statute about it, which it has not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3092.185" offset="12510098">It simply redefined the word fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.986" offset="12521279">The statute prohibits fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.849" offset="12544789">The SEC announces that something is a fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative act which doesn't have any element of fraud in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.538" offset="12587525">It just says you can't trade if you have the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.750" offset="12600377">Again, if you look at one of the courts that's gone along with the rule, SEC v. Maio in the Seventh Circuit, says the rule requires a duty to disclose regardless of whether such information was obtained through a breach of fiduciary duty, so it seems to me that the rule has just outstripped the statute it's supposed to be implementing, and that's impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.476" offset="12703300">The second thing wrong with the rule is, the rule says you mustn't trade in connection with a tender offer.</text>
