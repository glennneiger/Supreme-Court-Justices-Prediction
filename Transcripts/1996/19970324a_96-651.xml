            <text syncTime="11.888" offset="192607">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.904" offset="212669">The issue presented in this case is whether due process requires a public employer to provide a hearing in every instance before suspending one of its employees without pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.500" offset="259062">The Third Circuit held that a Loudermill-type hearing providing for hearing and a notice to be heard must be given to an employee in every case before suspending him without pay, regardless of the reasons for the suspension, regardless of the governmental interests involved, regardless of the purpose to be served, no matter... regarding the substantial assurance of reliability, regardless of the duration of the suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.492" offset="407020">We think this is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.944" offset="416737">We think that the better rule is that which was announced in Mallen.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.729" offset="435964">In Mallen, the Court said an important governmental interest accompanied by substantial assurance that the deprivation is not without basis may, in limited circumstances, justify the postponement of a hearing until after the deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.671" offset="515689">What we are asking for here is for the Court to make explicit what was suggested in Mallen, that the university's interest in the prompt removal of a police officer arrested for drug-related charges justified Mr. Homar's suspension without a hearing and without pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.700" offset="619761">--it was my understanding that the Third Circuit wasn't saying you must have a full dress hearing, just give the officer an opportunity to say why he shouldn't be payless during the suspension period, just an opportunity, I think the words were, to tell his side of the story.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.518" offset="743059">In this particular case, we have... in this particular case, we have a police officer who was arrested on very serious charges, and that particular arrest itself required prompt action, just as in Mallen the Court said that the mere fact of the arrest is enough to undermine the public confidence and the public trust.</text>

            <text syncTime="753.076" offset="3157296">You apply it to some, you don't apply it to others, regardless of what it says on its face, and it shouldn't apply to me, and that's a much... I suppose a much more complicated issue than whether there was an arrest or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3187.232" offset="12893968">That saves the government money, because it means that in that situation the employer doesn't have to go out and hire a substitute, and it doesn't have to expend the resources to train that substitute and, of course, it also means that it avoids what could be the very significant cost of having to pay that employee back pay.</text>
