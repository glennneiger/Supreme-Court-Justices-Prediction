            <label>Mr. William L. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="5.165" offset="163572">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please The Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.318" offset="176216">We are here today representing the people of the State of Washington to defend their legislative policy judgment to prohibit assisted suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.334" offset="212265">The Constitutional concept of ordered liberty requires the drawing of clear lines to delineate that conduct which is permissible from that conduct which is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.590" offset="257300">The Washington statute prohibiting assisted suicide was forged at the common law, tempered by centuries of legal traditions and ratified by recent legislative action and by a direct vote of the people of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.889" offset="314456">The same prohibition has been enacted by the legislatures of virtually every state and the line that it draws in the end-of-life context is supported by the organizations of the health care professionals who care for the sick and dying on a daily basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.399" offset="380493">The issue here today is whether the Constitution requires that the social policy developed by Washington voters must be supplanted by a far different social policy, a Constitutionally recognized right to physician-assisted suicide that is contrary to our traditions and overrides the important state interests that are served by the Washington statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.216" offset="479759">In contrast to the clear line that is drawn by Washington law, Respondents offer a line that is unstable and inconsistent with the concept of ordered liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.543" offset="525107">It is inconsistent with liberty in three respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.976" offset="538795">First, it is limited to a very few of our citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.748" offset="557917">Secondly, those few must justify their exercise of this so-called Constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.903" offset="586547">Thirdly, if... even the Respondents and their amici agree that this right, if it is to be exercised at all, if it is to be recognized at all, must be closely regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.042" offset="635135">And their equal protection argument demonstrates just how unstable the line is, because they suggest that flowing from this Court's assumed recognition of a right to refuse treatment in the Cruzan case, there is a seamless web of Constitutional... excuse me, a seamless... stream of Constitutional rights that flows from that decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="145.956" offset="726772">Mr. Williams, in the Cruzan case, The Court recognized a liberty interest and yet it upheld restrictive legislation.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="161.237" offset="787899">So couldn't one take the same approach here, there is a liberty interest, but because of the risks and dangers involved, considerable state regulation is permissible?</text>

            <label>Mr. William L. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="176.177" offset="847667">Yes, Your Honor, one could take that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.258" offset="863968">The problem that that would create by recognizing a liberty interest is that many states are considering whether to move the line by legislation... in fact, our sister state of Oregon has done just that... in the beginning of a recognition of a liberty interest may limit their flexibility to deal with this complicated area.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.742" offset="941917">We agree that, even if you find the existence of a liberty interest, that the same important state interests that were present in Cruzan are present in this case and would justify the statute nonetheless.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_l_williams" startTime="227.378" stopTime="291.983">
            <label>Mr. William L. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="227.378" offset="1052467">Your Honor, there are three important state interests that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.472" offset="1068872">The first one is life, which includes the state's interest in prevent... is a subset the interest of preventing suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.367" offset="1096353">And, in the hierarchy of Constitutional value, certainly the protection of life is the highest.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.900" offset="1118505">In fact, one could argue that that's why people organize into communities, into civilized societies, is to protect life.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.466" offset="1144836">The second one is to prevent abuse and undue influence, and certainly the risk is higher in the physician-assisted suicide context than it is in the refusal of treatment context.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.074" offset="1191230">And thirdly, there is a strong interest in regulating the medical profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.216" offset="1203768">Precisely because physicians have the capacity to injure or perhaps cause the death of their patients, the state has an important interest in maintaining a clear line between physicians as healers and curers and physicians as instruments of death of their patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.360" offset="1280359">And we believe all three of those interests together or frankly any one of them separately would support the state legislation in this case.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="291.983" offset="1310870">Mr. Williams, taking the second one separately, the fear of abuse, the argument runs in various forms that, if what the... what the two Courts of Appeals so far have recognized prevails, the risk is that, in fact, the practice of assistance, so-called, is going to sort of gravitate down to those who are not terminally ill, to those, in fact, who have not made a truly voluntary or knowing choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.947" offset="1454753">And ultimately it's going to gravitate out of physician-assisted suicide into euthanasia.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.794" offset="1486100">One of the difficulties that I have with this case and with the one that follows it is I'm not sure how I should weight or value that risk or those risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.433" offset="1540644">What the argument raises is plausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.046" offset="1555168">I mean, it's easy to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.126" offset="1563422">But I don't know how realistic it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.708" offset="1573767">And I don't know how much weight to put on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.139" offset="1583484">What should I do, where should I look, or what methodology should I pursue to try to solve my difficulty?</text>

            <label>Mr. William L. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="367.494" offset="1612950">I would make at least two suggestions, Justice Souter.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.627" offset="1625489">First, look at the Respondents' equal protection argument and contrast that with the doctrinal support that they offer for a liberty interest in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.252" offset="1659971">The doctrinal support that they offer does not provide the limitations that they suggest should be in play with respect to this liberty interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.818" offset="1690168">Yet their equal protection argument that equates the withdrawal of medical treatment, in effect, which is a time-honored right under our common-law, with the physician-assisted suicide, when assisted suicide itself was contrary to the common law, it was a common-law crime, and yet they equate those two, while these Respondents may say that what they are trying to do is limit this to a narrow class, the next case will argue much the same as they have, that it should be extended perhaps to the chronically ill, perhaps to those who... to euthanasia for those who can't administer that.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.432" offset="1832692">And in fact, some of their amici have acknowledged that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="424.603" stopTime="463.768">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="424.603" offset="1841365">Let me direct you into a narrower channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.665" offset="1853590">I understand the, let's say, the problem of doctrinal slippage which is what you're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.791" offset="1882116">But there's also a, just, kind of an empirical component.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.843" offset="1894341">There's is a prediction about what, in fact, would happen even if the doctrine is maintained pure, even if we draw a line and that line is never going to be crossed.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.269" offset="1940004">What basis do I have for evaluating the claim that, in fact, apart from doctrine, this slippage is going to occur and that, in effect, the innocent are going to die as a result of this?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_l_williams" startTime="463.768" stopTime="489.154">
            <label>Mr. William L. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="463.768" offset="1997995">Again, the second suggestion I was going to make would be to look at the district court decision in the case involving the Oregon statute, where the district court noted that the proponents of the Oregon law which is limited in the same way that these Respondents suggest it should be, to the terminally ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.058" offset="2063197">But the proponents of that law acknowledged in that district court proceeding that they intend... that this was a first step and it would be extended by statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="489.154" stopTime="529.292">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="489.154" offset="2099559">But that's a variant... I think that's a variant of the... sort of the problem of doctrinal slippage.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.949" offset="2118681">This is step one and they have step two or three or whatever in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.511" offset="2136967">My question is, let's assume that there isn't going to be doctrinal slippage, let's assume that we're simply evaluating the argument that if you recognize what is being requested now, in fact, what will happen is that people who don't consent, who are not terminally ill, who do not even self-administer, are going to end up dying as a result of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.717" offset="2237799">What empirical basis do I have for evaluating that argument?</text>

            <text syncTime="3407.611" offset="13773368">Are you aware of anybody ever having been prosecuted for attempted suicide, which is unlawful in some states?</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.365" offset="13796356">I mean, assuming suicide, you know, early in life, not later.</text>

            <label>Mr. William L. Williams</label>
            <text syncTime="3419.909" offset="13822583">--Most of the... I believe all of the statutes making that a crime have been repealed because of the recognition or the heavy influence that mental disease, most likely depression, plays in the request for suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.577" offset="13869290">And that... by the way, there are studies showing that that's true with respect to people suffering a serious illness as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.990" offset="13890919">So it's the... the suggestion that somehow the terminally ill and dying are different in that regard is again not substantiated by the studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.226" offset="13919863">But the other observation I was going to make is that if one assumes that there is some covert practice in the current law with the line as clear as it is, if the line becomes unstable or gets muddied and the very private nature of the physician-assisted suicide transaction, if you will, between the physical and the patient, one must conclude that the abuses, if they exist at all, will be much worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.471" offset="14012859">At least the potential for abuse will be much worse in that setting as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="3483.662" offset="14077538">If you read the brief of the American Medical Association and the American Nurses Association and the other health care groups who filed a consolidated brief, that that information is in there, as well as the American Geriatric Society brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.898" offset="14118498">And one of policy arguments against allowing physician-assisted suicide is that it might be... become the alternative to improvements in palliative care.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.235" offset="14159876">Whether that's not... known or not, who knows, but that's one of considerations that anyone making this policy decision should take into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.801" offset="14186103">Justice Souter, I have had an opportunity to think a little bit more about your question about what... experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.853" offset="14206374">And I would point out that, in the Netherlands, one of the problems is that, because it's now permitted, it's become institutionalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.758" offset="14237930">And there is... although there is some disagreement about how the data is interpreted, that it appears to be pretty clear that a significant number of the deaths occur involuntarily without any consultation with the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.136" offset="14279517">The physicians over time believe they know what the patients will want and go ahead at what they think is the appropriate time and administer that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.048" offset="14307102">And I would also point out that the Supreme Court of Canada has rejected the notion that there is a Constitutional right under their Article of Freedoms, which is very similar to our Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.656" offset="14349525">And that the British Government, with the assistance of the British Medical Society, considered this, they rejected the notion on policy grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.970" offset="14374812">And of course, the New York State Task Force, which is the most comprehensive report on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.243" offset="14391948">So while we can't foretell the future for sure, that's one of the things that a legislature should take into account and we're asking the Court to give the legislature that opportunity.</text>
