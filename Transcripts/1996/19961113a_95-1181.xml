            <text syncTime="608.302" offset="2578274">The district court rejected the argument that the Treasury Amendment provided an exclusion for these off-exchange foreign currency options and therefore there was no subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.358" offset="2622474">The Second Circuit affirmed but did not independently analyze the Treasury Amendment exclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="632.489" offset="2675032">Those transactions were not conducted on a board of trade, and thus the Treasury Amendment excludes CEA regulation of petitioners off-exchange foreign currency trading.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.966" offset="2712962">As this Court has held, where the terms of a statute are not defined in the statute or have no common law... established common law meaning, they must be given their ordinary meaning.</text>

            <text syncTime="761.925" offset="3192779">The Treasury Department letter which was submitted as the Commodity Exchange Act... the amendments were being proposed and the definition of commodity was being substantially expanded beyond the traditional agricultural commodities, the Treasury Department was concerned that that language might include foreign currency transactions and communicated that concern to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.978" offset="3268952">Most of the specific discussion contained in the Treasury Department's letter referred to foreign currency futures.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.364" offset="3302493">However, the specific language which the Treasury Department proposed and which Congress enacted as the Treasury Amendment does not speak of foreign currency futures.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.759" offset="3344080">It speaks more generally and more broadly of transactions in foreign currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.712" offset="3363933">So, there would be no reason to take that approach unless the intent were to exclude the entire field of off-exchange foreign currency futures.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.489" offset="3399042">Indeed, the respondents point out that, as has already been commented on, in 1974 there was not an established market for off-exchange foreign currency options.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.956" offset="3440942">Thus, it really doesn't make sense to suggest that without such a market Congress intentionally chose the word in to distinguish futures from an options market which did not yet exist to any real extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.523" offset="3495172">So, accordingly, I think the ordinary meaning and the most logical meaning, which is confirmed by the congressional purpose, is that transactions in foreign currency was a broad exclusion to this new expansion of the definition of commodity under the CEA and accordingly should be given that effect by this Court, namely, to exclude the entire field of off-exchange foreign currency transactions, whether those transactions happen to be in the nature of futures, options, or any other type of transaction that there may be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1324.023" offset="5441190">The meaning, particularly in light of the way the Treasury Amendment came up, was clearly to exempt the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.849" offset="5476508">The Treasury Department proposed the specific language and Congress adopted the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.493" offset="5495003">I think it is clear that again if the intent were only to exclude futures, it would have been easy to say transactions in foreign currency futures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.699" offset="5539829">The language selected by Congress as proposed by the Treasury Department which wished to exclude CFTC regulation in the entire off-exchange foreign currency market was simply transactions in foreign currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.620" offset="5599597">The fact that the act in different places may provide regulations for options generally does not detract from the exclusion that the Treasury Amendment provided for those transactions in foreign currency whether they happen to be options or any other type of transaction in that foreign currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.171" offset="5677755">I would also note that, and getting back to one of the prior points in terms of delivery as a future compared to an option, is that the CFTC respondents argue that options only create a right rather than an obligation to purchase or sell the commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.891" offset="5780678">That type of distinction is really inaccurate because it doesn't properly describe a future itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.475" offset="5810980">Under the act there have been determinations that futures... instruments can be futures without that type of purchase and sale obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.762" offset="5860090">The CFTC... if purchase and sale of the underlying commodity were an actual requirement of being a futures contract, then the CFTC would not have been able to approve a number of exchanged-traded, cash-settled futures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.795" offset="5932292">Where there are no... where they can be no delivery, there is no obligation to purchase or sell the underlying commodity, and in fact some of these, such as Eurodollars... the underlying commodity doesn't really exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.882" offset="5984642">You couldn't deliver.</text>

            <text syncTime="1461.715" offset="5991956">So, the delivery aspect in an attempt to differentiate futures and options simply does not work because that is not an accurate description of commodity futures contracts themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="3444.093" offset="13921478">It's the CFTC that has the expertise in this area and can make those determinations of whether or not the transactions at issue pose the threat of fraud that was the underlying concern of the securities... the Commodity Exchange Act when it was enacted in 1936 and when it was expanded in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.725" offset="13992008">We think that petitioners' non-textual argument really is ultimately unpersuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.059" offset="14013324">Their notion is simply that it would be illogical for Congress to exempt both foreign currency futures and foreign currency options because they serve similar marketing and hedging functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.674" offset="14055747">But ultimately Congress has always recognized the difference between futures and options.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.609" offset="14075496">It has done so in the agricultural commodities, and we believe it has done so in these other commodities as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.982" offset="14097021">We think Congress has drawn a line here, and it has drawn a line between foreign currency futures and options.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.547" offset="14123247">It had a reasonable and sound basis for drawing that line, namely, the fact that options pose more serious risks of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.950" offset="14152923">Finally, the last point I would like to make is although we believe that the statutory language here is clear, if you disagree with us on that, then it's appropriate to give deference to the CFTC's view as the administrative agency that is administering the statute.</text>
