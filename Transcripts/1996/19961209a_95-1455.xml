            <text syncTime="1539.560" offset="6301363">Appellants would have this Court believe that the district court had in front of it a body of evidence that it considered probative to the question of purpose, and it sifted through that evidence and threw out all the evidence that it also thought was relevant to section 2, but of course the district court did not say that, and did not do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1592.845" offset="6514522">Yes, page 23a.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.987" offset="6519015">The court quotes from a panel opinion of a different panel but at the same court, and this is what it says:</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.660" offset="6549735">As the panel noted, the court in Miller reaffirmed that the purpose prong of section 5 must be analyzed within the context of section 5's purpose, which has always been to ensure that no voting procedure changes would be made that would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.874" offset="6626639">Now, it seems to me that the court is there making it clear that the only purpose evidence it would consider was evidence of purpose to effect a retrogression, as opposed to a broader purpose to discriminate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.100" offset="6787449">But more directly to answer your question, of course, it was stipulated in this case that there was no retrogressive effect of the plan, so under your understanding of the district court opinion, the district court would have only been looking at, at did they have a purpose to effect a retrogression?</text>

            <text syncTime="1861.980" offset="7590976">Let me proceed in two steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.893" offset="7598708">The district court, in analyzing whether or not two nonretrogressive plans reflect discriminatory purposes, compares the maximizing alternative to the plan adopted and again asks, do we have a legitimate, nondiscriminatory purpose?</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.702" offset="7653879">There is an impact here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.404" offset="7660670">One's got black majority districts, one does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.985" offset="7671015">Now, what the appellants are asking the district court to do is, after they've figured out whether that impact is motivated by a discriminating purpose, go ahead and analyze racial bloc voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.111" offset="7715528">Well, what would that show you?</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.022" offset="7723155">All racial bloc voting is relevant to is whether the black majority districts have an impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.516" offset="7745203">If you have no racial bloc voting, if you have no history of discrimination that currently excludes blacks, then there's no difference, as this Court noted in Johnson v. DeGrandy, between white majority districts and black majority districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.256" offset="7804135">Blacks can be elected in both districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.208" offset="7811972">So if the district court had gone on this detour that appellants insist they... insist it do, and agreed with them entirely, it would have returned to precisely the place it started, which is, yes, the NAACP plan, the failure to adopt it has an impact, but the relevant question under section 5 is whether that was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.303" offset="7900265">You see, all of the confusion comes here is because they keep quoting cases where plaintiffs, minority plaintiffs have the burden and, of course, in section 5 the burden is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.250" offset="7944151">So yes, in Rogers v. Lodge and Gingles and all of those cases, plaintiffs must prove racial bloc voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.724" offset="7969960">They must prove that you can create a compact black majority district, and then they must show that the failure to do so has an effect, and as Justice Brennan noted quite clearly in Gingles, it only has an effect if there is racial bloc voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.616" offset="8033594">So that is plaintiff's burden and, if they had the burden in the court below, they would have had to show that, but we had the burden, and we were making a much simpler argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.752" offset="8070061">We were saying, fine, the plan has an impact, but that's not the reason it did it... didn't... took the police jury plan over the NAACP plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.216" offset="8107991">We took the police jury plan over the NAACP plan because the NAACP plan clearly and irretrievably violated State law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3368.200" offset="13615857">--I'm not convinced it's right, Justice Scalia, but what is clear is that consolidation after the window opened again has happened in Bossier Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.889" offset="13658698">It was done by the police jury and could have been done, and indeed the record indicates that the school board could have drawn a plan with two majority-minority districts in it that ended up with fewer precincts in it than the police jury plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.336" offset="13712406">The other point I wanted to make is that the Court needs to understand that this is not a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.689" offset="13733826">This case is not about a choice between the plan they adopted and the NAACP alternative.</text>

            <text syncTime="3404.965" offset="13762979">It's very important to understand that this is about the school board's unwillingness to consider any alternative at all to the plan that they knew at the time was dilutive, and which they admit on the record at the time they knew they could have drawn one with two reasonably compact majority-minority districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.857" offset="13842496">It is not maximizing for the Department of Justice to question a jurisdiction that draws a plan which hardly serves its own interests, that pits incumbents against each other, that distributes the schools in irrational ways, and is dilutive, rather than adopting a plan that is fair, and that is really what this case is about.</text>
