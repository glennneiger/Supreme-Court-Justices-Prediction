            <text syncTime="17.574" offset="207127">The task before the Court in this case is to now make explicit what East River requires but necessarily left implicit, a definition of the product itself which is true to the principles of East River and is capable of uniform application by the Federal courts sitting in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.434" offset="282569">The product itself is the thing sold by the original seller or manufacturer to the original buyer of that thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="95.468" offset="518716">There may or may not be privity and there may or may not be recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.761" offset="531881">Nevertheless, the principles which drive the existence of strict liability, the necessity to make manufacturers responsible to produce safe goods put into the stream of commerce, counsel a broader interpretation of recovery.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith Zakarin</label>
            <text syncTime="136.357" offset="682242">Ordinarily, the answer is... the answer is that East River is silent as to the recovery in a particular contract of those items.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.296" offset="718082">It may be, under Hadley v. Baxendale and cases in particular State jurisdictions, that a contract could permit broader recovery than for the item itself, governed, of course, by the doctrine of foreseeability.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.755" offset="763849">Nevertheless, East River speaks to a limitation and a balance between tort and contract which permit tort recovery for those other items where contract does not permit it.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.764" offset="879937">East River does say quite correctly that recovery in contract will be governed by foreseeability as to those items governed by contract, the product itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="215.378" offset="998324">--Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it is indeed, but that relaxed standard is important in the area of unreasonably dangerous and defective products, since the manufacturer may not always be able to foresee, unlike a contracting party, the scope of damage that its product may cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.511" offset="1166866">The product as it left the Martinac Shipyard with the Marco hydraulic system aboard was a fully complete ship, admittedly not complete for the purpose it had eventually been intended, tuna purse seine fishing, but she was capable of sailing away, and did sail away.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.233" offset="1233739">Were that distinction of a changing product adopted by the Court, the balance given to us by East River... that is that the object of the bargain between the original manufacturer and/or seller, as it were, and the original buyer would be disturbed... the product would change as each went on, and the original focus upon the object of the contract would become diluted over time.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="295.398" offset="1318481">Mr. Zakarin, I'm not clear as to whether what East River is saying is that the manufacturer has the opportunity to protect himself against tort liability and, therefore, if he doesn't he should be socked, or rather is saying that the purchaser has an opportunity to protect itself against injury through contract and, therefore, if he doesn't do so the purchaser should not be given the tort recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.887" offset="1452437">Now, if East River is looking to the purchaser and saying look, the purchaser could have put this in the contract, then logically we ought to look to the second contract and not to the first contract, whereas if East River is looking to the seller, then you're quite correct, we ought to look at the first contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.118" offset="1513354">But why do you say that East River focuses on the seller rather than the purchaser?</text>
            <text syncTime="348.321" offset="1530177">I mean, each of them can protect themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.154" offset="1537491">Why shouldn't we say, look, in this last transaction if the purchaser wanted to be able to recover for all of the incidentals besides the tuna, he could have put it in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.840" offset="1576257">He didn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.321" offset="1578138">Tough luck.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith Zakarin</label>
            <text syncTime="361.313" offset="1582108">There are two reasons, Justice Scalia, why that would be the wrong focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.767" offset="1599976">For one thing, East River is not a singular focus upon the ability of the manufacturer, as you correctly point out, to protect itself, but it also looks to, as you also correctly point out, the buyer's ability to negotiate for additional warranties and the like, and that balance is respected in East River.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.618" offset="1671343">However, if that object of the contract is... if we look to subsequent sales, the object of that contract becomes ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.116" offset="1705302">Therefore, looking at the downstream sales and looking at what protections the purchasers in those sales made or didn't make is an unrelated proposition to the balance in East River between the original purchaser and the original buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.116" offset="1769354">But there's another reason, which is that--</text>

            <text syncTime="410.539" offset="1778967">I'm not sure what point you're making.</text>

            <text syncTime="428.171" offset="1849498">The original purchase provides an immunity for the product sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.196" offset="1869664">If that immunity is expanded, the expansion of that immunity bears no relation to the original object of the contract and is in effect a windfall for that manufacturer for immunity it never bargained for, never was paid for, and never discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.176" offset="1929537">But looking beyond that, East River is not a singular focus upon contract but also recognizes the important necessities driving the tort system, which is the place of proper encouragement upon manufacturers to foresee, spread, and control the risk.</text>
