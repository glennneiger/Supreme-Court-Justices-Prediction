            <text syncTime="8.721" offset="116742">The question presented by this case is whether Congress has authorized the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to regulate so-called off exchange trading in options to buy or sell foreign currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.244" offset="174838">In 1974, Congress enacted a series of amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act that created the Commission and gave it authority to regulate trading in a number of non-agricultural commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.398" offset="223531">One of those amendments, however, provided an exemption for “transactions in foreign currency” unless it involved sales for future delivery conducted on a board of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.411" offset="271491">The case before us today involves transactions and options to buy or sell foreign currencies that were not conducted over a board of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.995" offset="305869">The narrow question of law that we decide is whether such transactions are species of exempt transactions in foreign currencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.362" offset="339305">The reasons stated in opinion filed with the Clerk, we hold, that they are included within the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.240" offset="362816">We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.278" offset="375041">Our judgment is unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.889" offset="381415">Justice Scalia has filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</text>
