            <text syncTime="1528.430" offset="6251547">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.052" offset="6293970">The Wisconsin supreme court has made a common sense determination, in light of the modern-day drug trade, that in the execution of search warrants for... in felony drug-dealing cases it is reasonable under Fourth Amendment standards for the officers to knock, announce their presence, and give the occupants an opportunity to react.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.817" offset="6385085">There is discussion about what an invasive, intrusive entry into the home this search is, and we agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.507" offset="6419776">Agents inform me that if you had videotapes of a no-knock search and a knock search in a drug case, you would be... you would see almost exactly the same events occur on that videotape, that even in the knock case, there will be an overpowering number of officers that are going to enter those premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.788" offset="6516951">The officers will have their guns drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.324" offset="6527087">The officers will be shouting, police, police, search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.359" offset="6543282">The officers will round up all of the occupants on those premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.263" offset="6562822">Those occupants may sometimes be children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.882" offset="6573376">Those occupants may sometimes be elderly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.334" offset="6583093">Those occupants... because in Wisconsin we have no rule against night-time searches, most of these searches in fact occur at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.654" offset="6608380">Those occupants may frequently be sleeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.954" offset="6617575">Whether there is a knock-and-announce or a no-knock, there will be a rapid, overpowering securing of the premises by the law enforcement officers who enter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1873.327" offset="7631126">I assume that most drug cases do have a suppression hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.029" offset="7645963">It may be a simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.029" offset="7649934">It may not take very long, but usually there's a suppression motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.397" offset="7663413">Number 2, on the very premises of your argument, if you have to justify the failure to knock and announce, you're going to be able to do it, I would assume, without too much trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.622" offset="7712314">In fact, I assume you could do it with virtually no trouble in most cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.192" offset="7730600">There will occasionally be a rare case in which, for example, the informant has told you there are no guns, the marijuana is stored in bales out in the barn so that there's no risk of destruction, and in those rare cases you wouldn't be able to justify the failure to knock and announce, but in most of them you could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.856" offset="7813251">So are we talking really about the need for anything more than dispensing with what is probably in most cases almost a formality in the proof that you will adduce, the evidence that you will adduce at the suppression hearing?</text>

            <text syncTime="1948.908" offset="7933415">--Well, let's assume this Court says, look, we are perfectly willing to recognize that in most cases involving drug dealers the State will in fact have valid grounds for dispensing with knock-and-announce, because the marijuana won't be in the barn and the informant will not have said, these people are unarmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.971" offset="8021709">So that we said, we recognize that in most cases they'll be able to make their proof without great difficulty, but we're not going to adopt a blanket rule for the simple reason that if we do we're going to be starting down the road to more blanket exceptions, and more blanket exceptions after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.833" offset="8089105">So that in order to preserve the particularized inquiry value, which is a real value in the long run, we're still going to require the State in effect to make its proof knowing perfectly well that the State can do it in most cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.509" offset="8143857">Now, that, I take it, would be a fairly benign atmosphere for you to present your proof in individual cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.179" offset="8174473">Assuming we said something like that, are we then in this case arguing about anything much more than a formality?</text>

            <text syncTime="2019.970" offset="8217627">Let me say that the position you've laid out, as I understand it, is essentially that of the Solicitor General, and it's one that we would prevail on in this case under the record and that we would accept, but I do think that there are values and reasons to go beyond it for the blanket rule, and there are two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.765" offset="8288889">The first is that the officer at the scene, as he or she approaches the door, or as they approach the door in drug cases is... will be, under the blanket rule, able to make a strategic, tactical decision not worrying about whether or not it will meet a reasonableness Fourth Amendment test at a later time down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.963" offset="8385647">And in that regard I think it is... this case is very much in line with Michigan v. Summers, in which in the manner of the execution of the search warrant this Court did adopt a bright line rule that permitted officers to round up the people on the premises where a search warrant was being executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.626" offset="8468298">And here we are talking, just as in Michigan v. Summers, with the manner of the execution of the search warrant, and I believe that police officers, for their safety, for the safety of the occupants within, should be able to make those decisions on the entry based on their tactical and strategic decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.802" offset="8532977">Now, they may decide for reasons that were mentioned earlier by my opponent that in some of those instances it may not be safe and wise to come barging in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.325" offset="8567145">It may be safer for everyone to come in a different way, but that decision is a strategic and tactical one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.896" offset="8589402">The second issue is, I think that over time you will see those relatively benign suppression hearings become very complicated hearings about what additional facts did the police know.</text>

            <text syncTime="2171.831" offset="8825131">One is, what do we do about Wilson, where it was a drug case, and where the police knew in advance that she was armed?</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.187" offset="8862538">Was that just an idle exercise?</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.508" offset="8879779">And the second question is, in this very case there was one justice on the Wisconsin supreme court who said, I think that no-knock is generally required, but it's obvious that in this case it could be dispensed with, so it didn't seem like it's a very complicated exercise if you apply the rule, and if you don't apply the rule, aren't we just gutting what we said a couple of years ago?</text>
