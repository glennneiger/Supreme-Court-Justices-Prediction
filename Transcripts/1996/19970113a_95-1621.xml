            <text syncTime="25.528" offset="244288">This case presents two distinct legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.381" offset="259648">The first is whether an injured maritime worker who has received LHWCA, Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act benefits pursuant to an award by an administrative law judge can thereafter seek seaman's remedies or whether that person is precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.013" offset="330178">The second issue is whether an injured maritime worker's status as a seaman or not is dependent upon his job assignment at the time when he is injured or can be dependent upon his prior work history for other employers or for the same employer.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="66.674" offset="408859">Mr. Danoff, as a preliminary question, if the Court were to address the second question and conclude that we do not look at the prior relationship with other tug owner employers but confine the fleet principle to the same owner of the vessels being worked on, if we were to do that, do we have to reach the first question, or would that become advisory?</text>
            <text syncTime="100.047" offset="542292">I mean, what would happen if we were to decide the second issue in your favor?</text>

            <text syncTime="120.470" offset="624003">I think in this case yes, and the reason is that there is a significant and clear split in the circuits on both issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="134.634" offset="680637">I think it would not be... if the decision were made on both issues, as I think it should be, it would eliminate the problems we have raised in the brief with duplicative litigation in the case of each issue, and it would resolve the split in the circuits in each issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.613" offset="752630">The case could be decided on narrow grounds, but I don't think it has to be decided on narrow grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.387" offset="803726">I think people who are in purely deep water, or seaman issues, the second issue would be more important.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.542" offset="828281">To those who are involved in administration of LHWCA and paying benefits under the LHWCA, the first issue is more important.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.268" offset="859210">I think they're equally important to different segments of the industry, and to some extent to a group that it overlaps for, so I do think it is important to resolve both issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.097" offset="906544">The preclusion issue, the first issue involving the benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act, I wanted to underscore the difference between this case and the Gizoni case which was argued strenuously by the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.586" offset="968506">In the Gizoni case, the worker who had been injured had not received any sort of compensation order, whether by an administrative law judge or by a section 8(i) settlement or by the district director.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.987" offset="1030051">He was simply receiving benefits essentially voluntarily, at the same time seeking seaman status.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.190" offset="1054919">The difference between that case and this one is that in this case there is a compensation order, and that triggers section 905(a), which talks of... of the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act, which talks about the employer's liability is exclusive under the act, and the issue is what makes the employer liable?</text>
            <text syncTime="250.144" offset="1142691">In the case of the LHWCA, it's a compensation order, whether it's by settlement by the administrative law judges in this case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="261.404" offset="1187726">Mr. Danoff, would you explain to me... I know you have a literal interpretation of 905(a), but standing back from that, you mentioned the Gizoni case.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.750" offset="1233179">That says the employer who pays voluntarily under the Longshore Act would be amenable to a later Jones Act case.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.127" offset="1270691">On the other hand, if the employer says, not a penny until you drag me before some forum, they go into the Workers Compensation, the Longshore mold because it's the fastest, and in that case you would say there can't be any Jones Act, but in the other case where the employer was much more solicitous of the employee there could be?</text>
            <text syncTime="311.886" offset="1389705">What sense would that make?</text>

            <text syncTime="319.312" offset="1419380">On the other hand, from the employer's point of view they have... if they feel that the Jones Act suit is inappropriate, that status needs to be determined, they would have to object because the worker is seeking seaman status in the Department of Labor forum, and at that point get an adjudication of status.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.725" offset="1505061">Sooner or later there has to be an adjudication of status.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.185" offset="1558874">Now, I guess that's in the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="388.059" offset="1694397">Now, this Court expressed some reliance on that section in Gizoni, and presumably it's a section to which we have to give some effect, and I don't know how it would apply under your proposed rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2954.061" offset="11958430">And in that trial by jury, after you have a prima facie case established, which I believe we did in this case under Chandris v. Latsis, which was that the worker had contributed to the function and mission of the vessel, and that he had a connection with the vessel which was substantial in both duration and in nature, then that goes to the jury, and the jury considers things like perils of the sea, or the jury considers whether you ate, slept, or lived on the vessel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2995.037" offset="12122270">Now, there's four things about this particular ALJ determination that in itself makes it nonpreclusive, and the second one of that is the laches that this defendant, this petitioner, after believing that Sharp governed this case, after believing that it would be preclusive, did not bring it to the attention of the district judge, but waited until we got to the court of appeals.</text>
