            <text syncTime="151.125" offset="741270">First, the opportunity to sell development credits for the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is not a remaining use of Mrs. Suitum's land that could constitute a ripeness bar to her regulatory takings claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.936" offset="796441">Second, the monetary value of those credits, which was the sole issue in dispute in the proceedings below, has no relevance to the ripeness of her claim, and in any case is eminently fit for adjudication using ordinary appraisal methods.</text>

            <text syncTime="202.920" offset="948474">I believe on page 17 the distinction was between value and rights that were retained in Mrs. Suitum's property following the application of these regulations and value or rights that were obtained from the agency after the complete deprivation of her ownership rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.441" offset="1026528">The value of the TDR's... and we're going to use shorthand here.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.605" offset="1043141">When we talk about TDR's, transferable development rights, we're talking about these credits that the agency has created.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.319" offset="1066025">Their value, if any, is something that has been injected from the outside after all of Mrs. Suitum's development rights have been destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.505" offset="1102805">Those are values that she has obtained from the agency, not values that were retained by her property and, of course, when you look at it that way, and the reason that distinction I think is valuable is it illustrates that what TRPA is really doing here--</text>

            <text syncTime="773.892" offset="3232307">Significantly, I think, if we look at footnote 18 in the respondent's brief, the bottom line to all of this is, regardless of whether Mrs. Suitum goes out and goes through this process, tests the market, gets an offer, comes back to the agency and applies for a sale of these credits, it's the agency's position that the court should still make up its own determination of what the credits are worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.729" offset="3327706">So there's clear... more than an implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.253" offset="3345783">The TRPA has clearly expressed its position that the courts can determine the valuation issue completely independently of anything Mrs. Suitum is required to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1131.646" offset="4663295">However, if we were to look at the Abbott Laboratories standards we'd see that the basic issue in Abbott Laboratories, determining the ripeness of a preenforcement challenge to Federal regulations, is whether there had been a final agency action that imposed a distinct injury upon the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.689" offset="4735497">There clearly has been in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.762" offset="4743752">In fact, that would seem to be virtually the same as the final decision requirement in the specific land use context of Williamson County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.275" offset="4773845">What the agency is trying to do with Abbott Laboratories is shoe-horn its argument in through the second subsidiary issue of hardship on the parties and yet, of course, the hardship inquiry in Abbott Laboratories was not a balancing test, where we looked at the hardship on the plaintiffs of having adjudication delayed versus the hardship on the Government, whatever that would mean, of having a prompt determination of the legality of its regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.733" offset="4883664">The hardship inquiry applied only to the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.334" offset="4898084">What the Court looked at is, will there be an injury, a further injury to the petitioner of having adjudication delayed, and clearly that also holds in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.760" offset="4935804">Mrs. Suitum stands to suffer not only the additional losses of time and expense of continually litigating her basic constitutional rights, but her constitutional claims could, in fact, be mooted out if she complies with the procedural requirements that the Ninth Circuit has set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.853" offset="5016157">So frankly we think that this Court should simply reject TRPA's proposal to proceed with an Abbott Labs type analysis, look at Williamson County, look at MacDonald... those are land use cases involving regulatory takings challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.345" offset="5078119">The point of the Takings Clause is fairness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2990.730" offset="12099625">Well, we have said that we think there has been a final decision in this case within the meaning of Williamson, and perhaps the role that we see for Abbott Laboratories can best be hypothesized if at the outset of this plan, when the TDR's were brand new and no one had marketed any of them, every owner of one of these properties went directly to court and there would be nothing in the way of comparable sales, nothing but speculation about what the value of the TDR's would be.</text>

            <text syncTime="3030.517" offset="12258763">But that's because of the nature of the right the agency itself created.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.790" offset="12271928">You're saying that agencies can diminish ownership rights and diminish value and then claim as a defense the fact that this can't be appraised in court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.928" offset="12328457">Well, this was an effort to transform part of the bundle of rights in a way that would retain a substantial measure of value in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.096" offset="12377150">Those responsible for governing at three levels here, the States that entered into the compact, Congress, and the planning agency, recognized that because of the basin's peculiar ecological fragilities, further development on these parcels located in these sensitive areas could not be permitted, that this would threaten the interrelated environmental and economic well-being of the entire basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.007" offset="12504732">And so they tried to create a program that would retain a substantial measure of value for the owners of these parcels, and mitigate any loss that they would suffer as a result of what was not an extraneous restriction being placed on them but something very much related to the danger that their development would pose within Dolan v. Tigard.</text>
