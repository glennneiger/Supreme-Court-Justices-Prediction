            <text syncTime="2538.489" offset="10292810">While it seems convoluted, Your Honor, it makes sense because there is very distinct and separate remedies in 1983 and in habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.824" offset="10334188">In habeas corpus all you can get is a reversal of the hearing or return of your good time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.726" offset="10353728">You cannot get an injunction to attack an improper procedure or to try and stop the conduct from occurring again and again and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.714" offset="10385702">1983 allows you to go in and get a declaration and injunction to stop the conduct from occurring, and in many ways, it's a more efficient remedy than habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.749" offset="10425826">So, the two doctrines are separate and they operate separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.914" offset="10446515">And this Court said in Wolff and it has said over and again in different cases like Heck that you could actually have them both at the same time because they're addressing such different standards and different matters of proof, and they're statutorily created by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.141" offset="10507432">Now, to further your answer your question why you may not have this back and forth again and the trouble you're concerned about is in April of 1980... 1996 Congress passed the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.959" offset="10546721">It addressed virtually all of the questions that the State is concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.203" offset="10563648">First, you have to exhaust... when they looked at exhaustion... and Congress looked at exhaustion, they said we're going to make prisoners exhaust State administrative remedies, not judicial or court remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.229" offset="10603772">On the administrative remedies, Mr. Balisok has done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.601" offset="10617251">Second, for how the petition to go, it said, if you're attacking conditions in the prison or conduct of the guards affecting confinement, you can proceed under 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.546" offset="10661032">Congress has said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.868" offset="10666361">If you're attacking the result of the hearing or a term of confinement, you have to go to habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.173" offset="10691543">Those are the two routes you have a choice to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.153" offset="10699485">They're separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.385" offset="10704396">As for these claims going forward, Congress has said, you know, there have been too many of them, so we're going to enact a three strikes and you're out provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.420" offset="10736579">Three frivolous or malicious claims, you're gone.</text>

            <text syncTime="3038.577" offset="12293163">--Well, look... you can look at the language in Heck v. Humphrey where the State there was saying you have to in Heck... you can't allow this ruling to afford in Heck because it's going to be preclusion in State court, and the opinion in Heck addresses that point and says, no, it's not going to be preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.638" offset="12361395">Preclusion may not be... may not apply and it may not even be permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.979" offset="12378740">And it sets out in footnote 11 I believe why that's so because 2254 is Federal statute and the preclusion is judge-made law, court-made law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.748" offset="12421894">So, 2254 governs over court-made law when you weigh the two, and 2254 will give the independent review to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.333" offset="12456167">So, if you look at Heck in footnote 11, that's fully explained by this Court why preclusion wouldn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.857" offset="12486260">Mr. Balisok is simply asking for a right to review an unconstitutional procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.933" offset="12514577">Prisoners in the United States have really just four when it comes to fair hearings: a right to notice, a right to time to prepare, a right to present witnesses so long as it doesn't interfere with prison discipline or administration, and a written finding of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.310" offset="12568076">There's only four things that are given to prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.564" offset="12577166">He's simply asking in this case that these guards who had witness statements that he had asked for, who deliberately told them they didn't exist, that didn't date-stamp them so that he couldn't prove they existed at the time, but were later found in his file... that he have the right to have a ruling under 1983 that that conduct is unfair and it's unconstitutional and it shouldn't be permitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.297" offset="12780086">And then in the explanation of that it says, the court-made preclusion rules may, as judicial application of categorical mandate of section 1983 may not, take account of the policy embodied in section 2254(b)'s exhaustion requirement that State courts be given the first opportunity to review constitutional claims bearing upon State prisoner release from custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.430" offset="12868588">So, that's where you get the dichotomy on the case where 1983 deals with procedure, an unconstitutional procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3232.082" offset="13067223">Even if there is no preclusion with respect to the successful 1983 action, I think the primary concern that the State has is that the State interests and comity interests are not served by the State having a second independent opportunity to look at this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.158" offset="13155517">And the problem that we have with what has been described here is exactly the situation of running between the courts where Mr. Balisok says, well, yes, indeed he will go back to State court and present this declaration to the State court, this declaration of a Federal court, that there have been procedural violations of constitutional magnitude at this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.352" offset="13252275">And the State court is in the position at that point of either rendering an inconsistent result with a Federal district court that has looked at the same issue or the State courts and State officials are in the position of being persuaded by that--</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.186" offset="13395635">And the situation gets even worse because if Mr. Balisok then wins in his State habeas corpus petition, he has yet another avenue back into Federal court for the actual harm from the confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.836" offset="13458224">So, we have multiple times into the courts and multiple avenues into Federal courts when we bifurcate these actions and allow a 1983 procedures-only claim to proceed as described by Mr. Balisok.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.727" offset="13517783">The second point I'd like to address is just a question of whether the procedures are part and parcel of the liberty, and we think very much that they are.</text>
