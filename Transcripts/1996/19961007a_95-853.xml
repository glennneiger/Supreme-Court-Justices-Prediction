            <text syncTime="1485.474" offset="6082081">The issue in this case is whether or not the State is going to have to subsidize the cost of appeal of an indigent appealing termination of parental rights, and we contend that it does not either on due process or equal protection grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.492" offset="6138192">From a due process point of view, previous longstanding decisions of this Court have held that appellate review is not necessary for due process purposes, and as to the equal protection claim, this doesn't fit within any of the recognized equal protection type claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.285" offset="6213320">First of all, there's no disparate treatment among litigants.</text>

            <text syncTime="1526.543" offset="6246339">Second, there's no suspect class involved, because previous opinions of this Court have held that the poor are not a suspect class for equal protection purposes even when fundamental rights are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.693" offset="6299002">And third, there's no impingement of a fundamental right in this case because the only interference with the parent-child relationship is the statute that allows the State to terminate parental rights under certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.081" offset="6356576">The only issue in this case is what procedural due process must be provided prior to that termination, and that either goes back to a Mathews analysis of whether or not the proceedings that are provided are fundamentally fair, and then it would seem the question--</text>
