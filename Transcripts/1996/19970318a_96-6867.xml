Ramos, which is the case principally relied on by the Commonwealth, and how very difficult it is to get from Ramos to a result opposite to the result that was reached in Simmons.</text>

            <text syncTime="611.680" offset="2587279">Indeed, the choice that's referred to in Ramos I think pretty clearly is a choice to be more favorable to the defendant than California had chosen to be, a choice to remain silent about the possibility of parole, and those are the words... the possibility of parole, not the impossibility or the unlikelihood, the ineligibility of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.594" offset="2662929">A State, the Court said in Ramos, can choose to give more protection than the Constitution requires by remaining silent on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.199" offset="2701381">It did not say or imply that the Court may silence the defendant on that subject, may forbid him from bringing this truthful information to the jury's attention even where it is the only information that can rebut the charge of future dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.142" offset="2765120">The... I think it's... Skipper is indeed extremely close and Ramos extremely distant.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.385" offset="2822172">I guess I would add that even if it were not so, even if I didn't have a case as closely on point as Skipper, it would still be true that the rule in Simmons should not be considered a new rule, because I think that a relevant factor is not only the closeness of the prior precedent, but the egregiousness of the practice that is being condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.482" offset="2910570">And I think the practice here, which really did exist here... it may not have existed in Simmons, as the dissenting justices thought it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.654" offset="2939200">The majority thought it did... but it clearly exists here, is the practice of scaring the jury about a dangerous man being back on the streets of their community without telling them that there happens to be a State statute that forbids under any circumstances putting him back on the streets of that community.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.330" offset="2997923">To me it is almost as bad... I will grant the almost, but almost as bad as if a State had passed a law saying in a criminal case we will no longer permit a defendant to present the defense of alibi.</text>

            <text syncTime="744.367" offset="3118087">What you're saying now is that it is obvious from that that you can put in evidence, not that he's not a dangerous person, but as... but that although he is a dangerous person, you don't have to worry about it because he's going to be in jail.</text>

Commonwealth, and this is a case which the Ramos supreme court, the California supreme court had relied on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.407" offset="8306214">And in Jones v. Commonwealth the rationale for the States, and which they believed was the majority rule... was the majority of States believe this, and that was that even if the defendant was ineligible for parole, because that's what happened in Jones v. Commonwealth and he wanted an instruction, the Virginia supreme court said, well now, if we have to instruct him on that, to have a completely accurate instruction we would also have to tell them that really doesn't guarantee he won't be released, because the Governor could commute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.808" offset="8415824">In other words, the Briggs instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.259" offset="8421675">And Virginia supreme court said, we're not going down that road.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.695" offset="8431393">We are not going to allow that, because that would be so prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.563" offset="8442887">And in 1988, the most significant factor that shows that the Virginia supreme court's decision was a reasonable interpretation of existing law is the fact that no other case anywhere had held that Virginia's practice was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.907" offset="8500252">And I believe, Justice Ginsburg, as you pointed out, that the Simmons case itself was not unanimous, and I think that is compelling, if not dispositive evidence of the fact that it was a new rule because it obviously was susceptible to debate among reasonable jurists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.481" offset="8558557">But in 1988, under Ramos, it was very clear from Ramos that the decision of whether States should even... should, could, or should not instruct juries about any matters that come after the verdict about commutation, pardon, and parole--</text>

            <text syncTime="2130.282" offset="8661688">--At its simplest level, I was taking their argument, or a possible argument to be the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.102" offset="8684990">At its simplest level you have a rule growing out of preceding cases that where the jury is under an important potential, false apprehension about the difference between life and death, that under those circumstances the defendant has a right to clarify matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.663" offset="8759282">And on that very simple, basic way of looking at it, you would see Gardner, Skipper, and Simmons, each is involving a fairly simple misapprehension that was important and later clarified, while Ramos, you would see as involving a possible misapprehension, but one that was very unlikely to affect the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.596" offset="8851024">Not impossible, but unlikely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.398" offset="8862204">Now, under... that's the theory, or a theory I think that would say, Simmons is simply an application of a preceding existing general principle, and Ramos is the same thing, though the facts of it lead to the opposite conclusion, so I'd appreciate comments on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2199.294" offset="8937750">I would disagree with that for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.711" offset="8947468">First of all, I don't think that that's what Simmons said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.013" offset="8956663">I don't believe that Simmons is a rule of defining for juries, or giving them definite instructions about a sentencing option.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.702" offset="8995429">Simmons is a case about rebuttal of future dangerousness, a due process right of rebuttal of future dangerousness, and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.792" offset="9023746">It doesn't have anything to do with an instruction being inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.696" offset="9043390">It's not... that is not the rule of Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.079" offset="9052898">And secondly, in 1988, I think the equally important case to Ramos that was out there was Caldwell, and I think Caldwell clearly told States that if you want to correct jurors' possible misapprehensions about appellate procedures, or we can infer from that anything that comes after the jury verdict, then you may do that, State, if you want to, but... and the controlling concurring opinion in Caldwell said specifically that's a matter of... that's a policy choice to be made for a State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.654" offset="9199184">So I'm a court in 1988.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.439" offset="9210364">I think a reasonable interpretation of the law governing this issue that O'Dell is bringing before me is not only Ramos, but it's also Caldwell, that says these matters are policy choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.461" offset="9250488">And in fact I think that it was the prudent course in 1988 for a court to decide not to instruct their juries about... or take on that task of trying to disabuse them of misperceptions that they may have about appellate commutation, pardon, and parole procedures, because it's in my view in 1988, as a reasonable jurist, that's too speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.278" offset="9353724">It's getting too far away from the matter at hand, and that is, what is the appropriate sentence for this individual, and I think there was complete support for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.551" offset="9390818">The Virginia supreme court relied on Ramos, the Fourth Circuit relied on Ramos, the Fifth Circuit relied on Ramos, and this Court's decision in Simmons was not even unanimous, so I don't see how there can be a legitimate argument made that this was not a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.744" offset="9455602">I wanted to address briefly the question about this being a watershed, fulfilling the second exception to Teague or not, and I think that this Court's cases on the second exception have made absolutely clear that the rule has to do something more than just improve accuracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.141" offset="9529163">It has to do something more than that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2953.163" offset="11953221">And I submit a perfectly reasonable, I think rationale for the rule in 1988 was that courts for one thing did not consider rebuttal, I think, in the way that Simmons described rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.840" offset="12019990">I mean, they... I think as Justice Scalia pointed out, it was reasonable for a court to believe that you were not rebutting future dangerousness by showing that you were going to be parole-ineligible, because by doing that you were showing that you had a horrendous record, so terrible that the State was not going to let you out on parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.086" offset="12100970">A reasonable court I think would have not thought that was rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3021.391" offset="12226149">Mr. Chief Justice, I just want to address briefly the idea that the death sentence here was the result of the fear that he would be dangerous in prison, which has been an argument made both in the harmless error context and also in the context of suggesting that it was reasonable to... a reasonable jurist in 1983 might have taken that approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.275" offset="12333669">I think the... that what happened here is very closely analogous to what happened in Skipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.946" offset="12352372">I'm not saying that improper arguments were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.829" offset="12359896">Very fair arguments were made, but the arguments had nothing to do, or at least did not advertise themselves to have anything to do with the man's dangerousness in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.634" offset="12395109">The prosecutor had what you might think is this absolutely wonderful fact that a prison murder had occurred, and did not even mention in his closing argument that that murder was in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.324" offset="12433874">Indeed, he put it in the middle of a... what he called an ascending hierarchy, and chose to stress the more serious things that had happened afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.413" offset="12462296">He talks about a night stalker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.532" offset="12470759">He talks about the man at large on dark and rainy nights, and then he uses the language that I think Justice Souter read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.102" offset="12500957">Isn't it interesting that he is only able to be outside of the prison system for a matter of months to a year-and-a-half before something has happened again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.958" offset="12532408">But what is interesting about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.108" offset="12537006">What's interesting about it, of course, is that it generates in the jury the thought that this might recur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.945" offset="12560412">It's not an improper argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.647" offset="12567203">It's a perfectly fair argument as long as the defendant is allowed to rebut it, but it cries aloud for rebuttal.</text>
