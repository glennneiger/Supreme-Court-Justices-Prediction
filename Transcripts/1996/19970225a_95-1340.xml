            <label>Mr. Kenneth W. Starr</label>
            <text syncTime="9.998" offset="173276">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.390" offset="186860">This case brings before the Court three issues under the False Claims Act that represents the Court's first occasion to address some of the myriad issues which have arisen under the 1986 amendments to that act, and beyond, it is this Court's first qui tam case since World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.465" offset="275154">Two of the issues, the meaning of the public disclosure provision of the 1986 amendments and the meaning of the pivotal bedrock statutory term, false claim, are of enduring and high practical significance to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.579" offset="355611">The threshold issue in the case is retroactivity, addressed, of course, in terms of first principles by this Court in Landgraf.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.974" offset="393227">If the Court pleases, I will speak to the retroactivity issue before turning to the other two questions, which are looming large nationwide in Federal court litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.561" offset="443591">As to retroactivity, although issues of retroactivity and, indeed, its very meaning are not without difficulty, we believe that this case fits well within the Landgraf analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.243" offset="506285">In particular, the public disclosure provision of the 1986 amendments did something very specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.451" offset="547141">It eliminated a defense, a very basic defense, namely the defense of Government knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.644" offset="583921">That is, at the time of the conduct in question, Hughes' accounting practices under a variety of Government contracts, the fact that the Government had knowledge of the information or the allegations would constitute a complete bar to Mr. Schumer's lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.789" offset="676499">The 1986 amendments wipe this out, thereby expanding the circumstances under which a Government contractor could face liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.929" offset="796976">Both then and now he was liable for the same conduct, regardless of the Government's knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.585" offset="831666">I think the argument made by the other side is that all the change does is to say in the future we're going to let private people bring that suit as well as the Government, right?</text>

            <text syncTime="214.843" offset="992685">Now you have added a private prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.003" offset="1009299">How does that differ from a U.S. Attorney's Office that has no strike force at the time a crime is committed and then beefs up with a... just a tremendous high-powered crew?</text>
            <text syncTime="232.413" offset="1063007">Can the defendant say, well, it was a thin prosecutor's office when I did it, and therefore you can't retroactively set the strike force after me?</text>

            <text syncTime="245.701" offset="1116088">--Justice Ginsburg, we believe the key distinction is the fact that there is an expansion in your hypothetical of the public service, which is quite decidedly different, in our view, than empowering private individuals who do not take the oath of office and who do not operate, as this Court has noted in case after case, with the same sort of strictures that a public actor, a public official acts under.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.111" offset="1229772">It's altogether different if you're in fact facing the United States Government, including a beefedup United States Government, as opposed to a private relator who is motivated by an entirely different set of motivations.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.799" offset="1284525">This Court noticed... noted that in its 1943 opinion, decision in Marcus v. Hess.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.264" offset="1310334">There may be issues or motivations of greed, or an effort to seek vengeance and retribution with respect to a particular qui tam action.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.420" offset="1354951">Those are inadmissible qualities of an orderly public prosecution function, and there are any number of safeguards in place to assure that the public prosecution function that you identified is in fact carried out within the context of a culture of regulations and procedures and, indeed, those procedures are very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.954" offset="1445126">It was Justice Frankfurter who reminded us that the history of liberty is in no small part the history of procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.528" offset="1463412">Mr. Starr, are you then saying that if the Government agency... let's say there's an antidiscrimination law that's put in the charge of a Government agency, and then Congress decides to add on to that a private right of action because the agency isn't well-enough staffed.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.639" offset="1531852">The private actors who are given a private right, they cannot reach any conduct that occurred before the private right was created?</text>

            <text syncTime="1925.853" offset="7836767">Now, there is nothing in... there is nothing but discord at this point, and that's why the Ninth Circuit sent that issue back, and therefore there may be real money here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1941.332" offset="7898625">There are two claims, one of which rests on the issue that the... that Hughes has brought up here, the disclosure statement issue, and on that our position is that if the Government requires as a condition of contracting that you provide certain accurate information in order to safeguard the contracting system and to assure that the charges are proper charges, and if you knowingly provide false and incomplete and misleading statements and certifications, then there is a false claim, and that is true whether or not the claim is overstated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2144.228" offset="8710197">And the change here in terms of opening the door to the courthouse to individuals who would otherwise be subject to a bar is one which doesn't change the underlying rights, doesn't change the underlying duties, and in this case, since there can be only one suit for false claim, whether it's brought by the Government or a relator, it doesn't change the liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2545.330" offset="10314638">One is that there is no showing that Government contractors after the fact made these representations to the Government in order to cut off qui tam relators, and there's no showing that Hughes made any such showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.786" offset="10420486">All of this came out in the fullness of time, and no showing that the Government didn't act after the fact, if you came in and you said we knowingly gave you false statements, or we knowingly misled a contractor, and I don't think those kinds of expectations have ever been seen to be the kind that are protected by this rule of fairness on public disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.401" offset="10558935">The... it seems to us the critical points are that at no juncture in the evolution of the '86 jurisdictional bar provision were all Government disclosures a basis for prohibiting the going forward of a qui tam suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.834" offset="10700623">At every stage, the forms of disclosure which led to the bar were limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.869" offset="10740747">There was a set of negotiations which are not public, and in this instance as opposed to Landgraf after the discussions statutory language came out and nobody tried to explain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.071" offset="10813577">Everyone seems to have kept their word that the statute would be the statute, and at that point the forms, or the means by which disclosure could be made, were expanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.032" offset="10877420">But at the very same time, the word public was added before the word disclosure for the first time, and it's just impossible, if you read the statute for what it tells you, to say that a disclosure within a contractual relationship marked confidential, for business purposes only, in the only way that a disclosure can be made to a fictitious entity which is the other contracting party, namely to its responsible officials, is a public disclosure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2749.875" offset="11132793">We say a disclosure within the contractual relationship as such is not a public disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.419" offset="11162990">The Government says a disclosure to the allegedly wrongdoing party is not a public disclosure and here, because the allegedly wrongdoing party is a corporation, the disclosure to its responsible officers is the only way you can make such a disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.717" offset="11264137">I would point out that the Government's position at least averts the problem that's inherent in the tiny bit of concession that the petitioner makes, namely that the petitioners would have you have a jurisdictional inquiry into who in the corporation was involved in the wrong, where the Government at least faces up to that problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2824.896" offset="11432888">I'd like to take the issues presented in the reverse order, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.315" offset="11446576">On the merits as to the third point, the assertion Hughes now makes as opposed to the assertion it made in its petition that a claim under the False Claims Act is false and fraudulent only if it involves the submission of an inflated request for payment is quite wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.676" offset="11516061">As this Court stated 30 years ago in United States v. Neifert-White Company,</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.521" offset="11535392">"The act was intended to reach all types of fraud, without qualification, that might result in financial loss to the Government. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.206" offset="11566112">"It covers all fraudulent attempts to cause the Government to pay out sums of money. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.538" offset="11587428">That interpretation was expressly endorsed in the Senate report accompanying the 1986 amendments, and it is consistent with virtually every decision applying the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.156" offset="11629955">Thus, in our view, whenever a... a claim is false or fraudulent within the meaning of the act whenever it knowingly misstates facts bearing on the claimant's entitlement to payment or a benefit, regardless of whether the misstatement relates to price, the character or quality of the goods or services provided, the eligibility of the claimant to receive the benefit, or compliance with governing laws, regulations, or contract terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="2996.845" offset="12120639">I mean, taking this Court's definition from Gaudin and Kungys, the natural tendency to influence or be capable of influencing the decisionmaker seems to incorporate this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.292" offset="12166510">Any fact that bears on entitlement is one that is capable of influencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.007" offset="12185319">With respect to the public disclosure bar, we believe that allegations and transactions are publicly disclosed by the Government whenever they are revealed to a member of the public outside the Government other than to the suspected wrongdoer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.128" offset="12245818">In the context of a corporate wrongdoer, I will rush to the test that Justice Breyer identified as a clear minimal definition and state that, since corporations can only act through individuals, the test should be whether the persons to whom the Government disclosed the allegations or transactions received the information in his or her capacity as an employee or agent of the corporation, not just as an individual who happens to be an employee.</text>
