            <text syncTime="39.577" offset="304586">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="42.459" offset="316080">We're here today to contend that the Third Circuit was in error when it held that Rule 23 must be applied with a blind eye toward the settlement reached in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.645" offset="352860">In colorful language, the Third Circuit accused the district court and the proponents of the settlement of crafting a legislative solution to the asbestos crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.731" offset="389118">In fact, it was the Third Circuit that fashioned a new restriction on class actions that has no basis in the text of Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.796" offset="417435">The court declared broadly that Rule 23 must be applied without reference to settlement, and that settlement is an impermissible consideration, but the Third Circuit cited nothing in Rule 23 that says that the court lacks authority to consider settlement, and even some of the respondents now concede that the settlement should not be ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.167" offset="490891">We are not, of course, asking for any relaxation of the protections or the standards of Rule 23.</text>

            <text syncTime="113.165" offset="598934">The rule uses generic language about issues being in common, about claims, but it doesn't say that the action has to be determined to be triable before the case can be certified for settlement and, indeed, we've had 30 years of practice now in the various courts of appeals where class actions settled... cases certified for settlement have been accepted by--</text>

            <text syncTime="133.898" offset="681794">Mr. Shapiro, has there been anything like this... I'm not aware that there has been, and particularly this case comes up because of an antisuit injunction that stops every court in the country, State and Federal, I take it, from dealing with any of these claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.121" offset="6434689">I think I might begin with the question of whether the judicial power was being exercised at all in this case before perhaps turning to Rule 23, because, like Justice Kennedy, I do think that what the district court did, though judicial in form, yes, it was an injunction, yes, it had all the trappings, was legislative in substance, very clearly in violation, I think, of Article III as well as the Rules Enabling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.138" offset="6546806">And let me say why this is wholly unlike Swift and the other decree cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.052" offset="6570421">Of course it is permissible under Article III for people who are actually at one another's throats, including an agency that says you better do the following.</text>

            <text syncTime="2442.712" offset="9917125">They relate to the text of Rule 23 and whether it can possibly be stretched to confer judicial power to impose a binding order on an entire class where the class representatives could not be deputized to litigate it, and with Article III and due process problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.385" offset="9999776">Let me just say a word about each.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.446" offset="10004060">As far as the text of the rule is concerned, it talks constantly about circumstances in which people may "sue as representative parties" and, most importantly, there's no language in the rule that confers affirmative power to impose a binding settlement on the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.469" offset="10076158">It's a negative thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.851" offset="10081592">Rule 23(e) limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.292" offset="10091414">It says that you cannot dismiss or compromise a class action without judicial approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.874" offset="10117745">I think you have to twist those words out of shape to infer from them a power to judicially impose a settlement where you concede that there could not have been a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.632" offset="10164766">I also think that there's an intrinsic Article III problem, just apart from the facts of this case, in construing any rule of procedure to create circumstances where an Article III court may bind nonparties, but only so long as the parties who seek such an order have settled all of the disputes between them and have therefore put no controversy before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.901" offset="10277824">I mean, that's what it would come down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.253" offset="10283257">It would basically say the one precondition of getting the court to exercise its judicial power is that you guys don't disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.475" offset="10308126">I think that stands Article III on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.618" offset="10316694">I think there is a third problem, and it goes to Justice Scalia's question about incentive structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.103" offset="10342607">I mean, apart from the incentive to load up the class with additional people, which may be bad for a number of reasons, I think there's a fundamental point, and that is that representative parties, as the rule calls them, who concededly cannot carry on adversary class litigation against a defendant... which is your hypothetical, Justice Stevens, right +/?</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.287" offset="10431424">are necessarily hobbled inherently in negotiating with that defendant and thereby playing the role that due process and rule 23(a)(4) demands, namely, fairly and adequately protecting the interests of the class, because by definition... by definition, representative parties in that situation need the defendant's cooperation to get the class off the ground at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2729.922" offset="11065886">But a back end opt-out does not prevent this from being a binding exercise of Federal judicial power, otherwise... I mean, if they didn't need that they would include it in their inventory settlements that they settled on the side at quite a premium, and therefore I think that although the superiority determination under 23(b)(3) might come out differently with a back end opt out, I don't think the Article III problem or the textual problem would be solved, nor would the leverage problem.</text>
