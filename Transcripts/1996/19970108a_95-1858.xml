            <text syncTime="17.053" offset="207788">The question in this case is whether the state must remain neutral in the face of a decision of one of its citizens to help another kill herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.050" offset="255854">The Second Circuit below said yes, as a matter of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.883" offset="275184">It is New York's view, however, that the Constitution does not require this to be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.488" offset="301516">Indeed, equal protection is not implicated at all in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.461" offset="321473">Patients who withdraw from life support are not similarly situated to terminally ill people who are seeking physician-assisted suicide.</text>

            <text syncTime="55.048" offset="359821">Well, perhaps a more accurate way of putting your point of view, if I understand, would be that the Equal Protection Clause is not offended by treating those two differently, not that it's not implicated?</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis C. Vacco</label>
            <text syncTime="66.246" offset="404543">The Equal Protection Clause is indeed not offended, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.008" offset="419589">In any event we also believe that these, these two acts are similarly not situated and there are six primary reasons why we believe so.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="78.034" offset="451772">Mr. Vacco, instead of going down the list of six, if we could focus on what was of concern to the Second Circuit so we're not talking about a right to withdraw treatment from age 16 to age 96.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.255" offset="512585">The distinction that the Second Circuit fastened on was the terminally ill person who says no more life supports, I want to die, and the person who wants a pill that will achieve the same end.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.478" offset="585519">So let's narrow it to what that court was dealing with and tell us why that court was wrong.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_c_vacco" startTime="119.203" stopTime="193.436">
            <label>Mr. Dennis C. Vacco</label>
            <text syncTime="119.203" offset="616448">Justice Ginsburg, simply put, the people that you describe, or that the Second Circuit described, are not similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.268" offset="648631">In the first context the individual who is at the, in terminal illness, at the end stages of their life as the Second Circuit defined it, are exercising their right, which in New York state is recognized by not only the common law, but by our New York State Constitution, their right to refuse treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.362" offset="725013">That right which has been recognized for centuries as springing from the common law, the right of being free from bodily interference, the right to be free from battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.128" offset="768167">In the context of saying that they are refusing treatment, individuals, terminally ill or otherwise, are merely asserting that right to be let alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.296" offset="808814">On the contrary, and in contrast, are those individuals who are not asserting a right, that is, a bodily defensive right, their rights to bodily integrity, but instead attempting to assert, as the Plaintiff Respondents in this case are claiming, that there is some right to have a third party, in this instance physicians, help kill themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.521" offset="901705">And we believe that these two acts are clearly distinguishable.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="193.436" stopTime="235.600">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="193.436" offset="913303">But, if we had just those two neat categories, this might be an easier case; that is, of pulling the plug, that's the patient's choice, anything affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.720" offset="962518">But we're told in this wealth of briefs that there are things in between that go on, like sedation for pain that can be controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.381" offset="1017166">And that is not rationally distinguished from the pill that the physician... increasing, say, the morphine is not rationally distinguishable from giving a person a pill.</text>

          <turn speaker="dennis_c_vacco" startTime="235.600" stopTime="276.470">
            <label>Mr. Dennis C. Vacco</label>
            <text syncTime="235.600" offset="1082054">Justice Ginsburg, in all due respect, I disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.142" offset="1092190">The notion of sedation, and by the way, we happen to believe that the Respondents have misstated it factually and legally in their brief, but the notion of sedation as recognized by the vast majority of the medical professionals, is a notion of sedation in the imminently dying.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.255" offset="1176618">When individuals are actually in the last hours of death, sedation is for the purpose of treating four distinct symptoms, nausea, shortness of breath, delirium, and excruciating pain.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.507" offset="1237640">And only when these symptoms are intractable--</text>

            <label>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="276.470" offset="1245477">--Is that really a correct use of the word sedation?</text>
            <text syncTime="278.660" offset="1254254">It seems to me you're talking about analgesics, painkillers, whereas sedation is just to kind of make you feel better, not mind things so much, isn't it.</text>

            <text syncTime="287.996" offset="1291557">Mr. Chief Justice, as the medical professionals have written in their briefs and even the articles that are alluded to in the various briefs will indicate, the medication that is provided in these limited circumstances is provided only for the very limited effort to control those four symptoms that I articulated.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.310" offset="1376820">Yes, my only question is whether it's properly called sedation or not, or perhaps something else.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis C. Vacco</label>
            <text syncTime="313.314" offset="1392912">I am taking that terminology and that phraseology from the medical professionals.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.196" offset="1412347">The correct phrase in a medical context is sedation in the imminently dying, not terminal sedation as referred to in the Respondents' brief.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="328.104" offset="1452053">General Vacco, may I ask you, then, to train your attention on what has been described as the worst case, it's been called the barbiturate coma or whatever, that is not in the last hour or hours, what you've just been addressing, but you render a person unconscious, you withdraw nutrition, and water, and it goes on for days and days and the person finally shrivels up and dies, and that that, we're told, is permissible and goes on in hospitals in New York?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_c_vacco" startTime="363.997" stopTime="415.051">
            <label>Mr. Dennis C. Vacco</label>
            <text syncTime="363.997" offset="1595622">Justice Ginsburg, again I believe that the description of this by the Plaintiff Respondents is simply incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.672" offset="1630312">What really transpires... again the medication which is designed to deal with four specific symptoms is only administered to the extent that it will deal with those symptoms.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.440" offset="1681408">And the suggestion that the death is brought upon by virtue of a coma coupled with the termination of nutrition and hydration is simply wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.148" offset="1724249">Most medical professionals will agree that the death from the underlying illness or, if the drugs are going to suppress respiration so critically, that death will come from those two reasons long before it comes from starvation as a result of the withdrawal of nutrition and hydration.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ruth_bader_ginsburg" startTime="415.051" stopTime="440.400">
            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="415.051" offset="1799795">But the question I'm asking you is, you say you've distinguished the drugs at the last hour or hours of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.398" offset="1829157">But we're told that this treatment, whatever you want to call it, that inevitably will lead to death, will do so in a matter of days, not hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.914" offset="1879312">And that that goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.807" offset="1886835">And how is that rationally distinguishable from a pill that will work--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dennis_c_vacco" startTime="440.400" stopTime="455.831">
            <label>Mr. Dennis C. Vacco</label>
            <text syncTime="440.400" offset="1901254">Justice Ginsburg, it's rationally distinguishable because it is consistent medical practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.114" offset="1924033">It has never been... the concept of providing drugs specifically and solely for the purpose of killing someone has never been embraced by the medical profession.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_h_souter" startTime="455.831" stopTime="500.033">
            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="455.831" offset="1962903">--But, when you say it's consistent medical practice, I take it you mean, but if I'm wrong, tell me, I take it you mean that, once you accept the right of a patient to withdraw all life support including hydration and feeding, then the only way to prevent excruciating pain as the person nears death is with these extraordinarily high dosages of painkiller that induce coma.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.191" offset="2076379">So that your justification for the painkiller and the coma is essentially your justification for preventing excruciating pain which is caused by a decision which the individual has a right to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.063" offset="2135834">Is that your argument?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Dennis C. Vacco</label>

            <label>Justice David H. Souter</label>
            <text syncTime="502.924" offset="2151299">So it's not merely that the doctors have been doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.155" offset="2160180">The argument is that it's justifiable essentially on the ground that the right to withdraw life support is recognized and the right to ameliorate pain is recognized.</text>

          <turn speaker="dennis_c_vacco" startTime="518.716" stopTime="587.082">

            <text syncTime="519.066" offset="2215873">And indeed the subsequent administration of the palliative care drugs is consistent with the long-standing notion of the double effect, that the drugs in that instance are not being administered for the purpose of causing the death, they are administered in the context of the post refusal or post withdrawal of treatment palliative care of the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.972" offset="2307511">And those... that is indeed distinguishable from the act of purposely and intentionally providing a drug to kill the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.610" offset="2350038">And the State... besides the fact that the State believes that these two acts are indeed not similar, the State also believes that there are several legitimate interests that we have in regulating the process of physician-assisted suicide in New York State as we have, which is by virtue of an outright ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.701" offset="2426420">New York has chosen to draw its line in a rational and indeed in the same rational place that virtually every state in the nation has drawn that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.138" offset="2464141">This line that we have drawn in New York State is vigorously supported by professionals, particularly those--</text>

            <text syncTime="587.082" offset="2487965">But Mr. Vacco, you don't dispute that a legislature in New York or elsewhere could come to the rational judgment that a legislature in Australia or in Oregon or...

            <text syncTime="614.891" offset="2599142">What we are here today to say is that from New York's position, they should not be constitutionally compelled or constitutionally required to make those judgments or to change the line which is indeed a rational and principled line.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.821" offset="2650864">New York has made this judgment, and in some fashion that judgment has been based upon the widely quoted New York State Task Force on Life and the Law, which over a nine-year period conducted an exhaustive study on health care in New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.682" offset="2706348">And, while this study recognizes that there is needs for advancement in treating pain and recognizing symptoms of depression that lead to suicidal ideation, this task force report, which has been embraced by the New York State Legislature, quite succinctly and specifically says we should not embrace the concept of physician-assisted suicide because of the fear that it leads to euthanasia.</text>

            <text syncTime="1859.563" offset="7577872">Perhaps I would begin with Justice Ginsburg's question to the Solicitor General about winks and nods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.609" offset="7606084">I don't think the issue really is whether there are some people who violate existing laws like the law in New York which, as I hope to explain in a minute, really makes it legal to do what is described in a rather powerful article in the bioethics brief in support of Respondents as slow euthanasia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.445" offset="7709424">I don't think so much the issue is how many people violate the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.026" offset="7727710">Charlatans, doctors of death, just by the nature of it they operate in the dark and we don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.451" offset="7753414">The winks and nods I think affect the capacity of the system to respond humanely and rationally to what is actually going on rather than just to bright line hypotheticals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.170" offset="7804301">The winks and nods really relate to things that we all accept, the principle of double effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.655" offset="7830214">Just as Justice Souter asked the question, take one of our patient plaintiffs, the Jane Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.250" offset="7860621">She had a tumor that wrapped itself around her esophagus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.122" offset="7876085">Result, she couldn't eat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.594" offset="7881937">So she had the choice, she could have said no, don't give me a feeding tube.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.929" offset="7903357">She acceded to having a feeding tube implanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.762" offset="7914642">It had to be surgically implanted because it couldn't be done nasogastrically because Jane Doe really didn't have an esophagus left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.396" offset="7953199">As she neared death, and indeed only nine days passed between the filing of her declaration and her demise, as she neared death, she was, as are many patients in the modern world who die not rapidly of an infection but at the end of a long, degenerative process, she was the recipient of all sorts of medical interventions that she could have said no to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.491" offset="8041597">Some of them really weren't life-saving; they just prevented even greater torment, agony, disintegration, and then she did have a choice, she could have chosen on the theory I suppose that, even though her rabbi said you can't step in the same river twice, she could have turned back the clock, she could have said no to tube, she could now say take out the tube, I don't want it here anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.378" offset="8133130">And as the law of New York is now structured, because she is terminally ill, there is no inquiry into her intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.503" offset="8173672">Even if it were undisputed that the only reason she wanted the tube out was that that would enable her to die a little bit sooner, that would be irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.361" offset="8213065">It's not irrelevant when you force-feed someone, however, that is in the context of Mark Chapman, the guy who was force-fed in the New York case, the murderer of Beatle John Lennon, it was decisive, that the reason he didn't want food was not that he just didn't like it, he was anorexic or something, it was that that was his way of trying to kill himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.847" offset="8303031">And so his bodily integrity had to give way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.199" offset="8316405">That is, he could be force-fed under New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.682" offset="8330303">But, being terminally ill, Jane Doe couldn't be force-fed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.237" offset="8356530">And I don't think much should turn on the label of whether you call a tube a treatment or, as the Chief Justice asked, what in the world difference does it make if it's a tube or a spoon, it's an invasion of your bodily integrity which is where this principle supposedly comes from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.315" offset="8408879">So to begin with, we have this question: Jane Doe has the right to have the tube removed because she's dying anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="2750.568" offset="11141914">I mean, in a sense there are 50 laboratories out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.660" offset="11154244">The famous state laboratories of Justice Brandeis, although I guess it wasn't in the Brandeis brief, but he talked about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.046" offset="11183814">These laboratories, however, are now operating largely with the lights out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.130" offset="11200115">They're operating with the lights out because it's not just New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.552" offset="11217774">What I've described is as far as I've been able to determine through research of the law of at least 35 or maybe 40 states... and I know maybe I shouldn't admit that because that means that an equal protection ruling would require lots of states to reexamine where the lines should be drawn... but in all of these states what they do, and it's a logic that collapses on itself, is they combine two understandable principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.717" offset="11310456">One principle is you can medicate someone to make them comfortable, to reduce their pain even when you are pretty sure... or even when you know, as long as that's not your real intent, that it will hasten their death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.329" offset="11368970">The other principle is that a person has the right to say, no, don't give me that feeding tube.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.225" offset="11392481">Once I've got it, it may be hard to take it out, and anyway, leave me alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.257" offset="11408677">You combine these two and the logic so remarkably collapses in the case of terminal sedation, which is overwhelmingly documented everywhere in the country, it's not some sneaky practice, although it's called slow euthanasia in this latest article, that what you wonder is where did this all this come from?</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.449" offset="12193395">But the New York report, and perhaps this will get you to the autonomy interest and it bridges what Justice Breyer and Justice Souter suggested, that we're just beginning to get a public awareness and to find out much more about these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.980" offset="12255566">The New York report, it seems to me, is a Brandeis brief for the proposition that the autonomy that you suggest, that you wish to protect, or that you wish to create, is illusory, it's chimerical, that there will be less autonomy, less autonomy, by the unanimous judgment of the members of that task force, if you allow the option that you choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.216" offset="12360474">In fact, you will be introducing fear into medical care facilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3066.865" offset="12407077">That's what I get from the New York report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.637" offset="12414182">And I would appreciate your comment on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.569" offset="12425885">Justice Kennedy, I think as I read the report, the premise of that proposition was that people would be fearful that doctors would be making decisions in the end that would terminate their lives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.478" offset="12477503">What I'm saying is that the... if anyone reads that report as you have, as I have, and thinks about what happens in the hospital wards when terminal sedation is given, when the morphine drip is increased, when the person is asleep and it's said that they wanted the respirator disconnected but there are no required witnesses, that's pretty scary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.995" offset="12575619">And what I suggest is that the New York legislature, which initially outlawed all physician-assisted suicide, not by identifying physicians, but by just saying if A helps B commit suicide, it's a crime, now confronts a rather different regime, a regime that says near the end of life, whether or not the intent of somebody is deliberately to die, if certain techniques are used, combination of morphine and barbiturates, a surgical removal of something implanted, we don't call that suicide and actually we don't regulate it very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.561" offset="12725875">But, on the other side, if the patient is prescribed, at the patient's request, a lethal drug, we make that absolutely forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.108" offset="12764014">That combination which has not been chosen by the legislature, when Mr. Vacco held up that report and said, this is the choice of people of New York and I wondered what his answer was to Justice Ginsburg's question, who is the we, New York in its legislature did nothing in response that to that report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.849" offset="12843008">That is, they didn't change the law, but that was inaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.502" offset="12853666">The line, it's like Thompson v. Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.754" offset="12866623">When Oklahoma passed some laws that had the unfortunate consequence of exposing 15-year-olds to execution and, Justice O'Connor, you concluded that you didn't have to reach the ultimate merits of whether that was unconstitutional, because that was really a question that didn't have to be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.136" offset="12944154">It was at least Constitutionally dubious as I suggest the rationality of this line is at least Constitutionally dubious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.251" offset="12972575">That was a concurring both that in the end sent the thing back to Oklahoma and said if you really need to execute 15-year-olds, tell us that.</text>
