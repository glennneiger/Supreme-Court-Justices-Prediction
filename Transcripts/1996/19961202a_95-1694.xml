            <text syncTime="41.680" offset="302328">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="44.862" offset="315076">The issue presented for review in this case is whether the Eleventh Amendment immunity is lost if the State or a State entity has a claim for indemnification or reimbursement for any judgment entered against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.013" offset="383621">Here, the potential indemnitor is the United States Department of Energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.496" offset="401594">The issue arises in the context of a breach of contract action brought in Federal court on diversity grounds where the plaintiff is a citizen of New York and, thus, the issue does not implicate the question of the scope of the Eleventh Amendment that the Court has focused on in a number of cases, most recently in the Seminole Tribe case of last year, for even under the most narrow view of the scope of the amendment the question presented in this case would need to be addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.770" offset="530743">The Ninth Circuit court held that the university lost its immunity in this case because in this particular case it had a claim for indemnification against the United States Department of Energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.327" offset="592914">The core error of the court below was its premise that in each case involving a State entity the court can consider, and parties can litigate, the question of the payment source that would be used to satisfy a judgment that might be entered in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.583" offset="677969">Nothing in the Court's Eleventh Amendment cases supports that view, and we believe it is inconsistent with the terms, the meaning, and the purpose of the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.122" offset="724154">The core purpose of the Eleventh Amendment is to withhold jurisdiction from Federal courts and to withhold the exercise of Federal judicial power against a State in respect of that State's sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.554" offset="793848">Under the Ninth Circuit approach, Federal judicial power is potentially exercised against the State or its entity in virtually every case, or any case in which the plaintiff alleges that there is some payment source for the judgment that might be entered in the case that would satisfy the judgment and that would avoid payment of that judgment directly from the State treasury.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.424" offset="909309">I take it that it's your position that this reference to a source of indemnity is simply irrelevant as a matter of law, that there is no circumstance in which that should be taken into consideration in order to determine the Eleventh Amendment status of some supposed arm of the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.148" offset="1048176">If in some case there were an agency of the State which was entirely supported by indemnification from an outside source like the Federal Government, in that hypothetical situation conceivably the factor of indemnification would be relevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="269.688" offset="1214315">So that... in other words, that doesn't really qualify, I take it, your answer, because your answer is, on the assumption that State funds are reachable at least in theory, the existence of a third party indemnitor is irrelevant as a matter of law to the Eleventh Amendment determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.814" offset="1294877">Whether it's an indemnification, insurance claim, a possible claim over or against a third party, a possible joint tortfeasor, anything of the sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="336.297" offset="1480764">First, in the Hess case the inquiry that the Court made was whether that bi-State entity there, the path, had been established by the two States involved, New York and New Jersey, with an intention that those States be responsible for its various debts, and in that case the Court looked at that overall structure and concluded that the States did not intend their treasuries to be responsible.</text>

            <text syncTime="362.335" offset="1584940">So you're saying that the discussion there simply was a way for us to inquire or measure the connection between the bi-State entity and the State?</text>

            <text syncTime="377.085" offset="1643977">In fact, that was the standard that the Court announced when it made that... when it took those factors into account.</text>

            <label>Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</label>
            <text syncTime="384.441" offset="1673339">Mr. Miller, was an antecedent to getting to that in the Hess case that we were dealing with an entity that had not simply two States as creators, but the Federal Government as well, and then said, there is a presumption that such an entity founded by three sovereigns does not wear the mantle of a State, and maybe that presumption is undone if the States are legally obligated to pick up the tab for it, but--</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="417.443" offset="1805414">--That is absolutely right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.395" offset="1813146">That was going to be my second point, that the Court in the Hess case adopted a standard which started with a presumption against cloaking that particular entity with Eleventh Amendment immunity and required a demonstration that not only the States involved intended for the agency to have their sovereign power, but that the Congress agreed with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.538" offset="1897783">That's not the standard that would apply in judging whether an arm of the State is entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, but even under that approach there have been situations where a bi-State entity has been found to have Eleventh Amendment immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.999" offset="1959641">I think of the case in the D.C. Circuit of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which Justice Ginsburg's opinion cited in the Hess case, I think, but that was again an application of a special standard for the bi-State entity situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="508.267" offset="2168725">The university, to be sure, under the contract here would look to the Department of Energy to satisfy the monetary judgment awarded by the court, and it would hope, in the unlikely event that this occurs, that the Department would respond, but if it didn't, the university would be on the hook to pay the judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="565.385" offset="2397140">In this particular case, there is a general State statute that explains just exactly how, and to what extent, the State waives its sovereign immunity for itself and its entities, and the Regents of the University of California are explicitly named as one of the entities covered by that provision.</text>

          <turn speaker="lisa_schiavo_blatt" startTime="962.055" stopTime="1080.363">
            <label>Ms. Lisa Schiavo Blatt</label>
            <text syncTime="962.055" offset="3983817">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="980.618" offset="4058109">We believe that the court of appeals erred for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.369" offset="4073051">First, regardless of whether a State entity has a potential right of indemnity from a third party, the State's sovereign interests are implicated whenever the State has been sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.867" offset="4115056">Second, the court of appeals approach creates an unworkable approach to resolving the immunity question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.372" offset="4145149">As to our first point, this Court has repeatedly held that the Eleventh Amendment does not exist simply to protect a State against damages that must be paid out of the State's treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.379" offset="4189140">It also exists to protect the State's dignitary interest in not being sued by private parties without the State's consent, and it applies regardless of the relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.195" offset="4232398">Here, respondent seeks both damages and injunctive relief from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.260" offset="4256640">The fact that the Federal Government might be contractually obligated to pay the cost of any judgment in this case does not change the fact that the university has been sued and legally will be responsible for any judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.869" offset="4315050">Secondly, this case illustrates the problems created by the court of appeals decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.073" offset="4339918">The Department of Energy has not determined whether the cost of any judgment in this case would be indemnified under its contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.690" offset="4370325">The court of appeals opinion that the Department of Energy must pay those costs is merely advisory as to the Department, which is not a party to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.407" offset="4409195">A binding determination on the indemnity issue will be made by the Department of Energy's contracting officer after he or she reviews the relevant facts in the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1135.320" offset="4676898">There's a very significant change in the third party liability clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.314" offset="4696856">It will now be... the burden of proof will be on the contractor to persuade the contracting officer that damages were not caused by lack of prudent business judgment by the contractor's managerial personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.964" offset="4751504">It's both a widening of the scope of the potential contractor's officers that can commit misconduct or, if you will, conduct that would result in unallowable costs, as well as it's a heightening of the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.673" offset="4806256">It's no longer wilful misconduct or lack of good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.768" offset="4818691">It's simply lack of prudent business judgment, and the Department and the University of California are currently negotiating their contract to begin in the fall of '97, so we'll know then what that clause looks like.</text>

            <text syncTime="1253.183" offset="5148356">I think it's a fair characterization of the Ninth Circuit's opinion that what distinguished the university in this situation was the court of appeals view of the Department of Energy's contractual obligations, and our position is not to dispute any of the factors the Ninth Circuit looked at except for what they relied on, this payment factor that an indemnity allegation is solely a matter between the university and the Department of Energy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1358.024" offset="5567674">And this case could... illustrates what could happen is, the court of appeals opinion that the university will have the Department of Energy pay its judgment, the university might find itself compelled to pay damages in this case, yet ultimately unable to shift those costs to the Department of Energy, and in our view that would be impermissible under the Eleventh Amendment, and again that's because judgment is sought against a State entity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2174.948" offset="8835383">With due respect, Your Honor, it's our position that if a purported Eleventh Amendment entity takes its Eleventh Amendment immunity seriously, especially its dignitary interest, that the first thing it will do is move to dismiss based on the Eleventh Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2196.375" offset="8921065">The... it's also our position that each case, especially since the Eleventh Amendment immunity issue can be raised sua sponte by any court at any time, that any time a court, especially the Supreme Court, considers an Eleventh Amendment case, it will look at the whole picture, and so whether or not, of course, the university has been held to be an arm of the State in other contexts in other cases that were not in this Court doesn't really matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.128" offset="9068082">It's certainly not determinative or dispositive or anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.530" offset="9081770">I think that each case, as the Ninth Circuit did, looks at the facts, looks at the law as presented by the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.955" offset="9111445">In our proposed procedure, we suggest that the plaintiff had the burden of inducing facts and law that shows that the purported... that the State entity is not a State agency, that is to say, is not an arm, therefore doesn't deserve Eleventh Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.897" offset="9179154">Otherwise, you run the risk of undue expansion of Eleventh Amendment immunity, and anything that says "of California" is immune, and that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.733" offset="9222518">Now, Justice Ginsburg, I was thinking of something about insulating treasuries, and in this case the State law of California does insulate the State treasury from the Regents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.494" offset="9285629">Under State of California law, a judgment against the Regents can be executed only against the treasury of the Regents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.520" offset="9321678">There is no claim against the very separate and probably larger State treasury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2305.857" offset="9359086">So it's our position that even absent the pay directly provision in the contract, that the State treasury... as opposed to the Regents' treasury, the State treasury has no risk at all in any case, and that's--</text>

            <text syncTime="3093.341" offset="12508931">The foundation of sand starts here, because the ultimate foundation is the Hamilton v. Board of Regents case in 293 U.S., where this Court determined, based upon a study of the California constitution and statutes, that the university and its Regents were the State, and in fact that its orders, the orders of the Board of Regents, were equivalent to state statutes, would be deemed the same for purposes of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.373" offset="12625123">Now, that wasn't an Eleventh Amendment case, but I do think it's an important decision that was built upon in the decisions of the district courts and in the Ninth Circuit court that have held repeatedly that the university is an arm of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.433" offset="12689385">The decision in the Vaughn case which is cited in our brief, a district court case, is the case in which the factors were reviewed and then, in the various Ninth Circuit cases, Vaughn and other cases subsequent to Vaughn were referred to and relied upon as precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.376" offset="12757094">The fact that the university is an arm of the State is now beyond serious debate as far as the Ninth Circuit's concerned as a general proposition, and it ultimately rests on the decision of this Court in Hamilton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.035" offset="12811742">That leads me to the next point, which is the contention that the university is separate from the State because the State is not responsible for its debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.190" offset="12856359">Justice Kennedy, you anticipated our point on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.966" offset="12883527">The treasury of the Regents is very much a State fund, and all of the attributes of sovereignty that are given to the Regents in the California constitution and statutes are designed to assure that the Regents would be treated as a branch of State government, albeit independent of political control, for the very important reasons of academic freedom and independence of education that animated the founders of the State back in the middle 19th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.317" offset="13004839">Notwithstanding that, the constitution of California, Article XVI, section 8, provides a very special provision for any obligations of State universities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.486" offset="13061577">It states as follows, that all... from all State revenues there shall first be set apart the moneys to be applied by the State for the support of the public school system and public institutions of higher education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.087" offset="13123958">We referred to that in our brief, and pointed out that that gives in effect a first charge on the revenues of the State to satisfy the obligations of the university.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.195" offset="13164395">The manner in which that is done is the same manner in which the Congress funds Federal agencies, by appropriation, and no doubt until the appropriation is made a debt can't be paid if the Regents don't have otherwise sufficient funds, but in the end, the legislature is responsible, by constitutional provision, to meet the obligations of the university, and in that additional way ties the university tightly to the State of which it is a part and an arm, if not a branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.474" offset="13281528">I want to make just one other point, and that is that the relief in this case seeks not only damages against the university, but also hiring of the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.583" offset="13337953">He calls it reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.633" offset="13346103">He never was instated in the first place, so it's really instatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.515" offset="13361672">One of the... he asks for specific performance of the alleged contract, and he asks that in any event that he be hired by the university, or at the very least that his application for employment be reconsidered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.007" offset="13415693">Each of those forms of relief, if granted, would work--</text>
