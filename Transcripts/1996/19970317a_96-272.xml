            <text syncTime="1468.502" offset="6021357">The position of the Director of the Office of Worker's Compensation Programs is that a continuing nominal award is appropriate whenever an injured claimant has no current loss of earnings but is more likely than not to suffer a loss of wages at some point in the future as a result of a covered injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.810" offset="6082588">We believe; however, that the court of appeals erred in this case in ordering a continuing nominal award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.704" offset="6102128">Now, with respect to the propriety of continuing nominal awards, I think the heart of our submission is that such an award in appropriate cases is not an extrastatutory device, it's an award given to the claimant who satisfies all of the statutory prerequisites for an award of benefits, and for that proposition we would rely primarily on the language of section 908(h), which is reproduced at page 2 of the Government's brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1828.417" offset="7461018">The first is the provision that says the ALJ in determining wage-earning capacity should look to the effect of disability as it may naturally extend into the future, and we think that provision would be meaningless if the ALJ were required to set wage-earning capacity by reference to the wages that the employee was currently capable of earning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.819" offset="7542624">And with respect to the question, why can the ALJ award nominal benefits as opposed to taking a shot at estimating likely losses in the future, we think the statute gives the ALJ wide discretion in that it says that the ALJ may, in the interest of justice, fix such wage-earning capacity as shall be reasonable, and we think that encompasses the freedom not only to weigh the facts, but also to consider the totality of a statutory scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="2510.087" offset="10187679">When they list the qualitative factors, such as consideration of the nature of the injury, the degree of physical impairment, whether or not the claimant can do his usual employment, those are all things where it is difficult to imagine how you could ever get to a particular dollar amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.446" offset="10241073">And I think that when Congress listed that we should consider the effect of his disability as it may naturally extend into the future, they realized that it may be impossible at times to accurately give a particular dollar amount and therefore they envisioned nominal awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.966" offset="10295199">In fact, I have quoted the 1983 and '84 committee reports which certainly let us know that Congress is aware of the fact that these type of nominal awards were being issued and they did nothing to change the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.404" offset="10336890">And also, what I think is important about those committee reports is that there is a concern expressed, a main concern, I believe, that without these type of awards claimants are going to be coming in and filing yearly requests for modification because they aren't allowed to get a nominal modified award, and that would present an administrative nightmare, and I think that's why Congress... that's at least a good explanation of why Congress didn't change the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.209" offset="10424139">Your Honor, to follow up on your question, if there is no provision for nominal awards, there is what the circuit courts have termed an onerous burden on the administrative law judge to try to determine what exactly the loss of wage-earning capacity is in a case where there is serious medical disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.532" offset="10497387">As the court of appeals stated in the Randall case, the act requires omniscience of the judge.</text>
