            <text syncTime="10.547" offset="124029">This case comes to us on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.423" offset="147540">The petitioner, Johnny Lynn Old Chief was charged in Federal District Court with being a felony in possession of a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.396" offset="175438">At trial, Old Chief offered to concede his felon status and on that basis, he sought to prevent the government from entering into evidence the record of his prior conviction for the assault resulting in serious bodily injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.417" offset="231549">He claimed that telling the jury the name and nature of his prior offense would unfairly prejudice him within the meaning of Federal Rule of Evidence 403, but the District Court ruled that the government was entitled to prove every element of the offense with its own chosen evidence and was not required to accept Old Chief’s concession in its place.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.078" offset="310230">Old Chief was convicted and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.307" offset="327053">In the opinion filed with the Clerk of Court today, we reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and hold that the District Court has used its discretion when it sprung Old Chief’s offer to provide the government with virtually conclusive evidence of his felony status and instead permitted the government to proceed with evidence of the name and nature of Old Chief’s prior felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.370" offset="407301">We agree with the general rule that a criminal defendant cannot interfere with the government’s presentation of its evidence by conceding some elements if not others but we find that the reason for that rule does not apply to prove of legal status resulting from a previous unrelated adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.478" offset="471771">Justice O’Connor has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Justices Scalia and Thomas join.</text>
