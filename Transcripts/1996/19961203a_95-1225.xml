            <text syncTime="298.569" offset="1325124">There was, so far as I am aware, no explanation of why this change occurred in the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.595" offset="1361277">This is a question that in the Mundy case last term the Court found no occasion to reach, and it seldom makes a difference, because it can make a difference only if the... in a 1-year period, because either you can... you can go back 3 years from when the return was filed to see... to ask for refunds of taxes paid during those 3 years, or else 2 years after the tax was paid, and usually with a really late-filed return no taxes were paid within the 3 years or the 2 years, and it makes no difference, as it makes no difference in either of the cases before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.203" offset="1535671">In any event, let me proceed now to the next provision, and for our purposes the more important provision, subsection (b), which appears on page 3 of the Government's brief, and it starts off with a subsection (1), which states quite unequivocally the consequences if the claim is not filed within the prescribed period.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.457" offset="1680703">No credit or refund shall be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.890" offset="1694391">Now, that... it's hard to see that that provision has much purpose other than to emphasize the strictness of the filing requirements and, as we point out on page 20 of our brief, this point is reemphasized in another provision of the code, section 6514(a)(1), which states that any credit or refund which the Service actually gives on a claim that is filed after the expiration of the statutory periods of limitation is "erroneous" and "considered void".</text>
            <text syncTime="433.476" offset="1864814">And it's interesting that in the implementing regulation for that provision, section 6514, the Service, after tracking the language of the statute, then has a cross-reference to the provisions authorized in suit by the Government to recover erroneous refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.733" offset="1957810">But the next subsection seems to us to be what I might refer to as the clincher, the most dispositive obstacle to the respondents and the Ninth Circuit's position in this case, and that is subsection (2) of subsection (b), which is captioned, Limit on the amount of credit or refund that can be given, and I cannot emphasize too strongly that these caps on the disbursement that can be made from the Federal Treasury have their own express limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.944" offset="2158639">While there is a cross-reference to the claims limitation period for purpose of separating categories of claims, there is no cross-reference to the claims limitation for purpose of defining the cap itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.627" offset="2233349">It says in subsection (A), for example, the amount of credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid within a period defined right in this provision equal to 3 years plus the period of any extension of time for filing the return, and in subsection (B) it's the same thing, that the amount of credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the 2 years immediately preceding the filing of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.872" offset="2378381">These are substantive limitations on disbursements from the Treasury that are authorized.</text>

            <text syncTime="910.075" offset="3771126">It could be temporally limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.525" offset="3780948">They could expand the time perious upon a showing of certain kinds of incapacity, but they could expand them for only a limited time, because each year you expand it you're adding another 200 million tax returns that possibly could be reopened at a time when there's talk about downsizing the Internal Revenue Service, and at a time when there are budget constraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.407" offset="3912500">And in order for legislation of this kind to be adopted, Congress needs help in preparing a revenue impact assessment of it, rather hard to do, since we don't know easily how to estimate how many additional out of time refund claims might be stimulated once there were a provision that allowed consideration of the individual circumstances of taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.269" offset="4043948">The Service has estimated that it now turns down about 250,000 refund claims a year in whole, without examining whether the refund was warranted or not because they're out of time, but most tax counsel who wouldn't file an out-of-time refund claim today on behalf of a client, might... that figure might increase a great deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.056" offset="4159096">So another possible legislative response to this would be simply to increase the limitations periods in the hope that more situations such as the alleged situation of Mr. McGill would be caught without having to examine the individual circumstances of individual taxpayers, just to give their guardians or relatives more time in which to ferret out examples of this kind, which would be much less administratively burden... there are all kinds of possibilities, but to date nothing has been proposed by the administration to the Congress, nor am I... we'll of course inform the Court if any action is taken either on the Hill or by the administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.202" offset="4379674">In the meantime, it must be recognized that the press release that was issued was issued on the premise that the existing law bars such claims, as we think these caps on the refund do, and there's no point in saying that the claim can be allowed for a longer period if you can't get any payment as a result of filing the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.308" offset="4484059">So read as a whole, the provision is inconsistent with equitable tolling, as the Court concluded the applicable provisions in the Lampf case were, and I do want to emphasize that with respect to an express cap on disbursements from the Treasury there is no more fitting example of where the traditional rules about waivers of sovereign immunity should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.572" offset="4613104">When Congress has explicitly capped the disbursement that is authorized to be made, that cannot be enlarged beyond what the language requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.670" offset="4673499">As the Court has said about waivers of sovereign immunity, a court is not in a position to enlarge it on equitable grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.717" offset="4713728">It's quite different from just a statute of limitations on the filing of the claim itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1188.359" offset="4884255">It's a form of claim for avoidance of the limitations period that isn't as precisely defined a deferral of the limitations period as the ordinary tolling claim, but it's very similar, and we think the Dalm decision does have a controlling analysis here, and in particular its holding that these provisions concerning tax refund suits must be read in conformity with one another and with all the cross-referencing that's involved here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1288.923" offset="5286541">What the Service knew was that he himself, even though the claim now is incapacity because of alcoholism, he himself had filed in January of 1985 his estimated tax return and payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.046" offset="5355086">His father had done that with his prior installments of estimated tax for 1984.</text>

            <text syncTime="1332.513" offset="5460934">In 1985, he entered into an agreement dissolving the partnership so that he could operate the shop on his own.</text>

            <text syncTime="1696.863" offset="6918358">This section 6511(a), I submit, contemplates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.897" offset="6934450">If we have someone who does not perform any of these two predicate acts, let us assume he didn't in 1962, and let 30 years go by without paying his tax and without filing his return, and then one day he walks in and files his return and pays the tax, and then a year later figures that he overpaid and files a refund claim, that is a perfectly timely refund claim under anyone's interpretation of 6511.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.078" offset="7067152">Even though the Government will have had to wait 31 years for the return and the check, even though the litigation to follow, all the facts and circumstances that underlay the tax, occurred 31 years ago, that is the way section 6511 operates.</text>

            <text syncTime="3230.555" offset="13053059">In Irwin, the Court recognized that waivers of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed, and then said that once Congress had made such a waiver we think the rule of equitable tolling should be applicable to suits against the Government in the same way as to suits against private defendants, and that amounts to little, if any, broadening of the congressional waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.504" offset="13172908">Those... that rationale applies to tolling of the limitations for filing suit, or for filing claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.713" offset="13213659">It really is not addressed to the obstacle here, which is a substantive limitation, a cap that Congress has imposed on the amount of the refund that's authorized to be disbursed from the Federal Treasury and, as I pointed out earlier, therefore it would require a broadening of a waiver of sovereign immunity beyond the express terms of the waiver to rule that a court may override this cap in the very sensitive area of disbursements from the Treasury, the area that is most related to the constitutional underpinnings of the doctrine of sovereign immunity itself, including the provision we have pointed to in the Constitution, in Article I, section 9, Clause 7, that no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.171" offset="13507589">Now, it is the fact that in Webb the Fourth Circuit suggested some ways of reading the rebuttable presumption in Irwin more narrowly, and we have done the same thing in a pending petition and reply brief in a case called United States v. Fagin involving the Quiet Title Act, which we have suggested that the Court hold for the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.161" offset="13635485">But... and I think that these suggestions are well worthy of consideration, and the Court in Webb at the conclusion of its opinion pointed out some other areas involving other Federal statutes where various courts have held that the rebuttable presumption has been overcome even if the presumption of Irwin does apply, but in this particular case we're really beyond the area where it's just a limitation on the filing of the claim that's at issue.</text>
