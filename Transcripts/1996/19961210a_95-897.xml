            <text syncTime="78.843" offset="454987">This case involves the application of a rule in the Fair Labor Standards Act dealing with the salary basis test.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.170" offset="492290">The rule is contained in 29 C.F.R. 541.5d and 541.118.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.446" offset="521338">The rule basically provides that for persons to be considered white collar exempt... that is, professional exempt adminis... professionals, administrators, exempt administrators or exempt executives, their salary must be fixed and not contingent.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.367" offset="593018">The specifics of the rule provide that they must receive a predetermined amount not subject to deduction because of the variations in quality or quantity of work.</text>

            <text syncTime="125.255" offset="640561">I've noticed with interest that the Federal Government does not follow the salary basis test for employees that are under the jurisdiction of the Office of Personnel Management.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.422" offset="717257">In 1975, I believe, when the Federal Government first came under the act, Congress provided that the Fair Labor Standard Act would be enforced by the Office of Personnel Management, but that the rule... but the definitions would still be defined and delinated by the Department of Labor, and when the Office of Personnel Management initially issued regulations for the Federal sector, they defined exempt status for salaried persons based on salary classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.150" offset="820179">But that definition was challenged in court in a specific case involving the Uniform Division of the Secret Service, Police Sergeants and Lieutenants, and the court of claims in that case specifically found that the enforcement by the Office of Personnel Management has to be undertaken consistently, consistent with the Department of Labor regulations, because it's the Department of Labor that defines and limits exemptions--</text>

            <text syncTime="205.366" offset="961031">They found it... and they also found it in some other cases involving the AFG case, which is cited in the briefs, and currently the position in the Department of Labor... I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.891" offset="999170">The position in the Federal Government is that the Office of Personnel Management often treats people as exempt even though they're not salaried, but the Court of Claims and the United States District... the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia have held that they should apply the salary test.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.974" offset="1071477">And when that has been a challenge... and the one place it's been challenged specifically is in the Uniform Division of the Secret Service and for employees that are exactly... do the exact work of the employees in this case, that is, sergeants and lieutenants in the Uniform Division, and the court ruled that the Department of Labor pay classification things have to be applied consistent with the salary basis.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael T. Leibig</label>
            <text syncTime="264.696" offset="1198328">The Office of Personnel Management takes the position that Federal employees can be exempted based on pay classification alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.260" offset="1220584">I do not think that, and I think that the courts have found that to be the case, and I don't think it's consistent with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.033" offset="1243676">For example, when Congress passed the statute applying the Fair Labor Standards Act to themselves, they did make... apply the salary basis test to themselves, and under the Professional Accountability Act, the regulations under that act specifically say that the salary basis test does apply to congressional employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.853" offset="1306997">And it specifically includes the regulation including, there was some discussion in the comments on the regulation of whether 541.5d, which is a special rule limiting part of it... I'll talk about in a minute... how that should be dealt with by the Congressional Accountability Office, and after considering the comments they included the regulation and specifically made reference to the applicability of the salary basis test to congressional employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.520" offset="1397694">So... and in addition to that, in the record there's a history of the Department of Labor's current consideration of the regulations and as part of that history the Director of OMB has had a series of reports and considerations with the Department of Labor about this problem and what to deal... how to deal with it in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.551" offset="1465821">So the answer is, the Office of Personnel Management, just like a lot of employers in a lot of places, claim that they can exempt people based on classifications alone, but when the Federal Government and when the Congress have looked at it they've said they have to--</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael T. Leibig</label>
            <text syncTime="355.467" offset="1561430">They have a regulation to... yes, that's true, they do, and in the... and the... that raises the question of whether that would make all Federal employees subject to that rule, which doesn't cover all Federal employees, but I think it covers all Federal employees in the Classified Service, nonexempt, and I think that is part of the struggle the Department of Labor has had, and that is why the Department of Labor has had the practical rule to the longstanding salary basis test, and I think I can explain how the practical rule I think works.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.386" offset="1677100">But if you look at, and we attach the Department of Labor briefs going back from 1981 and their positions, there has been some development in how you deal with the problem where there's a rule on the books that seems counterintuitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.425" offset="1729240">How can an employer apply that rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="399.826" offset="1738853">And I think the rule that I would argue is that the first rule of the regulation, and after all, the Department of Labor that issued this regulation issued it under a direct rule of Congress, is that the employee's salary must be fixed, and it cannot be contingent.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.706" offset="1806458">An exempt employee cannot have contingent income, and that, however... that is the test, and then, however, there can be a situation where there are rules on the books, where people have a rule that says you're... you can be subject to discipline by... for 14 days, which would be longer than a work period, so that would be okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.822" offset="1894857">But if under that rule they discipline somebody for 1 day, which, by the way, the statute... the Federal regulation doesn't say they can do, but if they did do it, that would raise the question of whether the people were practically subject to deductions for less than a full work period, and I think in that case you'd have to prove... if all you had was a rule and the employer claimed that the people were exempt and that they were not doing deductions, I think the burden's on the employer to come forward with some evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.658" offset="1990256">They at least have to assert that we wouldn't exempt... we would not punish anybody for less than a pay period, which the Federal Government could do in a--</text>

            <text syncTime="1527.016" offset="6247693">The first is that the Secretary interprets the phrase subject to reduction to mean that there must be more than a theoretical possibility that a violation of a work rule will result in a partial week disciplinary deduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2065.739" offset="8402586">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.625" offset="8438112">Let me address this... at least partially this question about the chief of police's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.216" offset="8460473">First of all, I think it's important for the Court to understand that the chief of police does not impose discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.681" offset="8478341">That is the role of the police board, which is the defendant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.572" offset="8489835">Secondly, if you examine the testimony that Mr. Leibig was referring to, the chief consistently says, you know, maybe that could happen, it's possible, but he can't recall it ever happening, and I think that's important, and I think that points out the problem with petitioner's position here as to someone who's subject to a deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.556" offset="8565799">And it goes to Justice Breyer's point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.947" offset="8575412">Logically, you could file one of these lawsuits and take the deposition of the chief executive officer and simply ask the question, is it possible that you could discipline one of your vice presidents who is found to have engaged in some kind of misconduct for a period of less than a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.506" offset="8641658">And if the answer to that is yes, it's possible, because that is part of the inherent right of management, then the logical extension of petitioner's argument is that everyone in that organization, because they are conceivably subject to an improper deduction, would be nonexempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.908" offset="8707173">Therefore, no one, whether you're a vice president, or Bill Gates, whatever it would be, under that theory would be exempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2492.754" offset="10110576">Secondly, our position has been consistently in this litigation that if we are wrong... and the Eighth Circuit's opinion actually only says arguably that this deduction made Sergeant Guzy nonexempt, and we think it's just as reasonable that it may not be, but our position has been all along that if at the outcome of this litigation it is determined that that was an impermissible deduction, the salary test basis is validly applied to the Board of Police Commissioners, then we will comply by reimbursing Sergeant Guzy, and we will continue our existing practice of not allowing deductions of less than a week for exempt officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3024.853" offset="12239033">The Secretary's interpretation is that generally, if you perform any work at all within a week, if you're a salaried employee, you shouldn't lok at the number of hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.519" offset="12269648">It shouldn't matter.</text>

            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="3048.151" offset="12332238">I don't understand that.</text>

            <label>Mr. John B. Renick</label>
            <text syncTime="3049.600" offset="12337985">Well, we think that's even more so demonstrated by the fact that in 1992 the Secretary of Labor amended the regulation 541.5d that applies to public employees, so that the salary basis test, if you read it, doesn't even mean what it says for public employees, because the salary basis test says you're supposed to receive a predetermined amount of compensation every pay period that is not subject to reduction based on quality or quantity of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.092" offset="12463999">The Secretary of Labor, through a rulemaking procedure in '91, looked at the outcry that this caused in the public area, that there are many people who are exempt, but because of principles of public accountability are... under State laws are not able to be paid for time they don't work, so the Secretary amended the regulation to specifically allow a public employer to make deductions on an hour-by-hour basis from an otherwise exempt employee's salary and still allow them to claim that they're paid on a salary basis, which in and of itself is inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.014" offset="12603598">So the salary basis test as applied to public employers no longer means what it says, and we say, why should there be this disciplinary deduction aspect maintained when the Secretary has already recognized that the variation in quantity of work does not destroy the salary basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.157" offset="12692205">I would also point out that, in the petition that was filed by the petitioners in this case, they took the position very clearly that this Court was required to defer to the interpretations of the Secretary of Labor, and this Court invited the views of the Government, asking the Solicitor General to file a brief prior to deciding whether or not to accept this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.556" offset="12801815">In that case, the Secretary of Labor's views were specifically expressed, and it was described in that brief as for the sole... for the very specific purpose of clarifying what the Secretary's position was on these interpretations, and the Secretary has specifically disagreed with the position taken by the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.969" offset="12883421">But the petitioners continue nonetheless to have had... apparently have had a change of heart as to the deference owed to the Secretary of Labor under the circumstances, and we would submit that the... whether or not the Secretary's interpretations are agreeable to the petitioner should not determine whether or not they are entitled to deference in this case, and we believe, under the circumstances, that they clearly are, and as I said earlier, if you accept the Secretary's current clarification of what the interpretations mean, this case fits squarely within it, whether or not you get to the window of correction.</text>
