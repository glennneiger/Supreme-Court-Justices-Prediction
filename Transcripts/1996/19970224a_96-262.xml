            <text syncTime="9.267" offset="168163">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.570" offset="177358">The question presented by this case is whether the civilian judges of the Courts of Criminal Appeal of the Coast Guard were properly appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.625" offset="209646">In actuality, there are two questions: 1) did the Secretary of Transportation have the statutory authority to make the appointment, and 2) if he did, is it constitutional for him to have done so because the officers are principal offices rather than inferior officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.245" offset="272131">Congress first provided for civilian appellate judges in the armed services in 1950, with the passage of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, in particular, Article 66(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="46.442" offset="316852">It was available to all of the armed services, but the legislative history is clear that it was intended principally for the use of the Coast Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.527" offset="349244">Until 1993, the Coast Guard used civilian judges and, like all of the other military judges who were appointed to the military appellate panels, they were appointed, as they were for the other armed services, by the person known as the Judge Advocate General of the armed services, which in the case of the Coast Guard is the general counsel of the Transportation Department, and before that the general counsel of the Treasury Department.</text>

            <text syncTime="95.364" offset="512562">In 1993, the Court of Military Review for the Coast Guard, as it was then known, recognized that there were serious Appointments Clause problems with respect to the civilian members of the Coast Guard Court of Military Review.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.212" offset="572016">The problem arose because the Judge Advocate General is clearly not one of those listed persons in the Appointments Clause and therefore cannot constitutionally be designated as an appointing officer even for inferior officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.522" offset="629172">As part of its opinion in a case called Senior, the Coast Guard Court of Military Review asked the Secretary of Transportation to "reappoint" all of the civilian judges, and he did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.562" offset="681417">In fact, he did that for all of the judges of the Coast Guard Court of Military Review, and although he did not cite 49 U.S.C. section 323(a), or, in fact, any other provision, that is the statute on which the Government relies, and the first question presented is, is that reliance justified?</text>
            <text syncTime="155.744" offset="754142">The Government recognizes that, despite the broad language of section 323(a), it cannot be used if there is another statute that provides for another method of appointment for this particular office or any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.982" offset="811089">The question in this case arises because Article 66(a) does not use the word, appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.128" offset="843585">It uses... it used initially establish, and then constitute, but the history is clear that from 1950 until 1993, it was the Judge Advocate General who actually did the appointing for the civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.347" offset="904503">The Government says because the word appointment wasn't used we should not--</text>

            <text syncTime="197.919" offset="922789">--Well, Article 66 speaks in terms of assigning, doesn't it, not appointing?</text>

            <text syncTime="203.913" offset="946821">Well, it first talks about constitute and establish, and then it uses the word assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.258" offset="968137">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.249" offset="972108">The Government argues from that that it should not be treated as an alternative method of appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.435" offset="992901">The first answer we have to that is that it has been construed by the agencies all across the military from 1950 to 1993 as providing the appointment power.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.201" offset="1035951">Indeed, there is no other provision of law that would allow the appointment of civilian judges in the Coast Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.094" offset="1063536">There certainly was nothing from 1950 to 1968... '66, when the Coast Guard was transferred from the Treasury Department--</text>

            <text syncTime="2244.052" offset="9107370">First, Article 66 doesn't use the word appoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.643" offset="9121685">It says the Judge Advocate General can establish a court of criminal appeals, refers to judges assigned to that court, but there's no plain language that would suggest that the Judge Advocate General makes appointments at all, let alone that he is the sole appointing authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2481.387" offset="10056660">--I mean, with respect, we agree with the Chief Justice that it's not a stretch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.240" offset="10076095">Article 323(a) says categorically that the Secretary of Transportation may appoint officers and employees within the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.586" offset="10105456">The only remotely difficult question is not whether 323(a) applies by its terms, but whether Article 66 takes away the authority that was otherwise conferred, and we think it's important to point out that to the extent that we can hazard an educated guess as to what Congress anticipated, neither side in this case is arguing that the system should work in precisely the manner that Congress expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.972" offset="10210991">That is, probably Congress expected that the JAG's would be solely responsible for placing individuals on the courts of criminal appeals, but it surely expected that the pool of potential judges would include all civilians who were members of the bar of a Federal court, or the highest court of the State, and we know that it can't work that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.515" offset="10289150">We can't have both sole authority in the JAG and that pool of judges, and therefore it can't be a dispositive objection to our theory that Congress didn't anticipate that it would work that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.481" offset="10333035">To the extent that Congress' expectations are relevant at all, the more accurate question is, which approach preserves more of what Congress wanted than the other one, and we think it would clearly have been more important to Congress that the potential pool of judges remain the same, rather than that the authority be lodged in the Judge Advocate General rather than the Secretary, because the Secretary in any event could direct the JAG to appoint... to assign whatever individuals he wanted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2594.160" offset="10507742">In addition, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces cannot review sentences in the same way that the courts of criminal appeals can do, and so that's an additional power that extends beyond it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.707" offset="10549956">For better or for worse, the Constitution creates only two categories of officers of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.802" offset="10578377">They must either be principal officers or inferior officers and, thus, if the Court reads 323(a) the way that Mr. Stewart suggests, the Court must then face the constitutional question of whether on balance these officers are more like principal officers or more like inferior officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.594" offset="10657476">We believe that the comparisons with the courts are the most relevant comparisons, and that compared with the judges of the tax court and other similar judges, these judges, who deal not simply with money but with liberty and life in some cases, are sufficiently important... they're sufficient--</text>

            <text syncTime="2697.519" offset="10921208">As I said before, the President could step in tomorrow and send these nominations to the Senate, and as soon as they were confirmed, that would be constitutionally sufficient, because under the Appointments Clause the President has the ultimate fall-back authority to make these appointments and to cure the constitutional defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.960" offset="10991007">So the question then is, under this choice that the Court must make if it agrees with the Government's submission on 323(a), are they more like principal officers or are they more like inferior officers and we believe that, given their wide-ranging powers and the practical finality of their decisions, the balance favors principal rather than inferior officers.</text>
