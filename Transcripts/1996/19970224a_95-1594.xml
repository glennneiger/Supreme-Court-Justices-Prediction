            <text syncTime="23.077" offset="218354">State laws of general applicability relate to ERISA plans only when they both operate upon a plan in its capacity as a plan, and when the effect of that law is to dictate or restrict and not merely influence plan choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.396" offset="283661">The health facility assessment, a gross receipts tax imposed upon hospitals in New York, does not relate to ERISA plans which operate their own hospitals because neither of these elements is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.995" offset="334025">The impact of the HFA upon plans is no more than that of the laws that were upheld by this Court in the Blue Cross v. Travelers case and the Court's recent opinion in California v. Dillingham.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.094" offset="390449">Like those laws, the HFA does not dictate or restrict plan choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.167" offset="414691">Like the surcharges in Travelers, the HFA may have an economic impact upon a plan's cost of providing benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.533" offset="448128">This impact may occur regardless of whether plans own their own hospitals or purchase hospital care services from third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.758" offset="481042">In either case, the economic impact of the law is not enough to make the law relate to plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.774" offset="509150">Notwithstanding the fund's ownership of the hospital in this case, the HFA also does not relate to the plan because it operates upon the fund not in its capacity as a plan but as a provider of medical services.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.694" offset="572784">The HFA is part and parcel of the State regulation of hospitals, and the provision of medical services is not a plan function which ERISA preemption was designed to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.131" offset="622521">When plans choose to provide the types of benefits which are not strictly financial but which involve services, those services remain subject to generally applicable State regulation whether plans purchase those services from third parties or choose to provide those services in kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.326" offset="703292">The operation of a hospital, like the operation of a day care center, the practice of law, and employees' training programs, are not plan functions--</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.244" offset="6339053">What's being taxed are the contributions that are being paid to the fund by the employers required under the collective bargaining agreements to make those contributions, and benefit payments being made for the benefits that the ERISA fund is paying, so this case involves a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.078" offset="6410315">There's a clear indication in the legislation itself and in the legislative history of ERISA that Congress intended tax... State tax laws to enjoy no charmed existence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1591.424" offset="6491713">And when the fund is being required to pay a State assessment on the very activities that makes the fund a fund, the very health care benefits that the fund is paying out, the contributions that the employers are paying for those benefits, I submit to you that it's self-evident that the tax in this case relates to the fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="2493.662" offset="10100686">Your Honor, the HFA is not a tax on benefit contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.519" offset="10132137">It's a tax on hospital receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.100" offset="10142482">The characterization is equally applicable to any time a plan purchases services from any hospital, so when Mount Sinai, a private, nonplan-owned hospital, receives benefit payments from any other plan, Mount Sinai can claim we can't pay the HFA because the plan made these payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.535" offset="10228163">It's a contribution, and therefore it's a tax on plan contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.385" offset="10243628">While to the plan that makes the payments when they're purchasing services, whether it's health care services or day care services, it may represent a benefit payment, to the taxed entity, to the hospital, to the day care center, it is simply income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.906" offset="10305695">Secondly, in these service areas, if you can regulate these entities, you should tax them, you should be able to tax them, because ERISA makes no distinction in its preemption provision between regulatory laws and tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.519" offset="10380092">With or without the Hawaii prepaid legal services... I mean, sorry, the Hawaii prepaid... yes, health service exemption, State tax laws are treated the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.085" offset="10422410">They are relate... they are preempted only if they relate-to, and the State's argument is in these service areas you may regulate without regard to ERISA plans, and therefore you may tax in these areas without regard to the fact that ERISA plans are purchasing services in these areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.039" offset="10502240">Finally, Your Honor, outside of these service areas the tax issue is a complicated one, and one which is really not fully addressed in these briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.093" offset="10538394">For instance, the notion that ERISA plans are carte blanche exempt from Federal and State taxation is simply not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.201" offset="10570890">I would urge you in this case not to get into a general tax analysis, and the State itself is limiting its argument to the purchase of services and the taxing of services in these areas which are matters of traditional State concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.119" offset="10634524">It's not necessary to determine whether the States can tax the corpus of trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.074" offset="10654377">Those are... present different and perhaps more complicated issues.</text>
