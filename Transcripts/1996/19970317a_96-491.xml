            <text syncTime="1941.809" offset="7909736">First of all, I think the tooth extraction case might come under the exercising part of section 510, but in the Third Circuit case, the Gavelette case, the Court determined that the employer decided that a large group of employees at one plant were about to become vested at one point, or were subject to vesting and were about to reach the vesting point, which is possible, considering that vesting is over time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.258" offset="7999598">It might be a plant that was just opened 5 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.291" offset="8007748">Under those circumstances I think an argument, a strong argument can be made that section 510 has been violated even though the decision is not on an individual basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2068.540" offset="8416721">Now, Justice Kennedy, in your question, the person that had the tooth extracted clearly would violate section 510, the exercising clause, to fire him because he filed a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.614" offset="8461025">I think a strong argument can be made that if the employer sees him coming down the hall with his claim form and a stack of medical bills with it, it might violate 510 then as well, and it might violate 510, the exercising clause, if the employee... employer knew that that employee has a particular illness or particular condition that is going to require, or has already required large expenditures or benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2613.641" offset="10597110">Now, section 510 was adopted as a corollary to ERISA's vesting requirement, which was essential to the statutory scheme put in place by Congress, and for the first time Congress required that pension benefits become nonforfeitable after a set period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.054" offset="10682791">Congress recognized that employers might circumvent that vesting requirement by discharging employees who were about to become vested, and they installed section 510 to deal with that problem.</text>

Circuit was struggling with what several other courts have struggled with as how to fit section 510, how to square section 510 with these kinds of fundamental business changes, cost-based changes that employers ordinarily do, and this is very much like the kind of change that Peter Drucker talked about in his Wall Street Journal article some years, Sell the Mailroom.</text>
