            <text syncTime="2741.995" offset="11116365">In light of the questions about the practicality of how this injunction works, it might be useful to look at this case from the vantage point of the trial judge in February of 1992.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.613" offset="11174775">At that point, he had had several days of hearings on the preliminary injunction and weeks of testimony on the contempt proceedings against Paul and Robert Schenck and others who violated the temporary restraining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.432" offset="11230050">One of his findings, and they're set out at pages 79 to 149 of the Joint Appendix, one of his findings was that these named defendants had deliberately engaged in a technique of physically crowding in an intimidating and obstructing manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.847" offset="11319703">What's a trial judge supposed to do in the face of that kind of finding?</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.602" offset="11342690">If he were to issue an injunction precisely in those terms ordering the defendants to cease crowding in an intimidating and obstructing manner, what problems would that cause for a police officer who is at the scene, trying to understand how to enforce that?</text>

            <text syncTime="3368.902" offset="13623912">Actually, what General Dellinger was referring to on page 29 says that the scope of the injunction and these injunction floating zones do float without geographic limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.739" offset="13663304">It says that they are structured to protect the rights of all party and directed to the activities at the site chosen for demonstration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.574" offset="13690681">Anyplace these individuals are demonstrating is the site chosen for demonstration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.006" offset="13708339">As I understand the Government's argument and the respondents', there is now a medical exception to the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.731" offset="13735298">This Court in Madsen dealt with evidence that came to the same conclusions regarding increased stress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.153" offset="13756927">Despite that increased stress, the no-approach zone was still deemed to burden more speech than necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.779" offset="13783467">If the owner of Claiborne Hardware had a heart condition, would he now say, get these protesters away from the front of my store because I've got a heart condition that's going to be aggravated when I go in there, and I think the answer has to be no to that, that... the owner of a fur store is aggravated because there's animal rights protesters out there picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.561" offset="13862566">I think these are the types of things which is part of our free debate.</text>
