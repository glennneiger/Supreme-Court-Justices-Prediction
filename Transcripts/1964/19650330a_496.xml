            <text syncTime="44.066" offset="280618">In yesterday's questioning there were some questions directed both to me and to Mr. Emerson concerning population and birth rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.883" offset="319906">In our brief at pages 27 and 28, we cite the statistics that show that the birth rate in the State of Connecticut last year, for the seventh straight year, was on the decline.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.448" offset="386152">The birth rate in the United States is apparently also on the decline, and I would point out to the Court that in the Reporter magazine of March 25th, 1965, there is an article entitled "Our Population.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.643" offset="474969">The Statistics Explosion," written in part by Richard M. Scammony, who was the head the Census Bureau, that points out that the growth rate or the birth rate in this country is actually on the decline, and takes great issue with the so called experts, using his term, of a population explosion.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.600" offset="602760">The tenor of his article is that this so-called fear that there will be no breathing room is actually a false use of statistics, that in fact if you use the same logic that people of this ilk have been using in the past, the statistics would show – that is, carrying out the same logic, that there won't be anyone in this country by the year 2000.</text>

            <text syncTime="1895.431" offset="7686123">If Your Honor please, our supreme court had referred to the Gardner case, and our opponents have pointed out that since the Gardner case in Massachusetts, the two other cases have come up restricting it; and I'm just pointing out that since the cases that they refer to come up, a third case had come up in Massachusetts which brings it back nearer to the original Gardner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.325" offset="7777656">I should like to point out that there has been a problem that prosecutions in Connecticut have been under in this area, and it could be seen best by the case of State verses Certain Contraceptive Articles, which is probably one of the more cited cases in Connecticut history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.007" offset="7860412">At the lime this case came up and you will recall that this was the companion of the Nelson case; this was a raid on the supply center of the Waterbury clinic, health center or clinic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.902" offset="7931988">This was a police raid on the basis of a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.867" offset="7947870">Now at the time that this came up, the statute that empowered the warrant was the gambling statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.216" offset="7973261">Connecticut had at that time no general search warrant statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.910" offset="7996040">There were statutes for narcotics, for gambling, for firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.391" offset="8021953">The gambling statute read something to the effect of, "for gaming, gambling or other crimes."</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.751" offset="8051419">This case, this warrant, was an attempt to get it in under the "or other crimes," and the Connecticut court held, and I believe rightly so, that the "other crimes" listed in that gambling statute were other clinics of the same ilk, gambling, et cetera, and therefore that there was no grounds under that statute for issuing a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.183" offset="8145147">Now, that case has been cited many times and our opponents cite it for the fact that Connecticut cannot condemn or claim as a nuisance contraceptives and I don't think the bare import of that case can be used to cite it in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.616" offset="8250890">If Your Honors please, it seems that what the Court here is being asked to do, as I started to say yesterday, is to overrule Gardner and overrule the case of Margaret Sanger, both cases in which this Court has held that it was within the power of the states to control these contraceptive clinics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.882" offset="8363948">They are also asking the Court, in a way, to overrule the Tileston case, allowing the doctor here to claim rights, the so-called of the patients, although, as Mr. Emerson admitted yesterday, the rights of the doctor in this case are essentially the rights of Ms. Royerbach, that the clinic or center here could have worked without a doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.367" offset="8469901">I think the best example of what the Court should do, at least according to our way of looking at it, was the words of Mr. Justice Black in the Ferguson case in 1963, because actually, what we're concerned with here and we quote, "We are not concerned with the wisdom, need or appropriateness of the legislation."</text>
