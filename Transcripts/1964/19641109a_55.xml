            <label>Mr. David E. Feller</label>
            <text syncTime="19.476" offset="77845">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.356" offset="93414">This case arises out of a suit by a union to compel arbitration of grievance which the union filed complaining that the employer violated the agreement and has passed practice by contracting out certain work.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.875" offset="183484">Now the case is, in many respects, a replay of this Court's decision in the Warrior &amp; Gulf and American Manufacturing cases, I think in the brief time I have -- I can best describe the case in terms of its factual background going way back before the filing of this grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.897" offset="283585">This -- I'm sorry, until 1952, this union which represents the employees at a refinery in Whiting, Indiana, had a collective bargaining agreement with the employer, which provided in very broad terms that any questions at all arising during the term of the agreement and specifically questions pertaining to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of the employment not covered by the contract could be processed, those questions could be processed during the term of the agreement through the grievance procedure and be taken to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.882" offset="479504">Here, they used to arbitrate what the wager rates used to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.265" offset="504999">In 1952, and this is all reflected in the affidavits filed in the court below in this case, the agreement of the parties was changed to provide insofar as relevant here that arbitration would be limited to questions involving -- directly involving alleged violations of the agreement and also questions alleging a violation of past practice, custom, or usage relative to working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.246" offset="672914">This cause remained in the agreement, virtually unchanged in successive agreements from 1952 on.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.502" offset="710008">It also provided that with respect to matters not covered by the agreement in the area of wages, hours, and working conditions, the grievance procedure could be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.243" offset="760895">Indeed, the grievance procedure was open to any question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.372" offset="781479">But that rather than arbitrate, if the company refused to arbitrate, the union could strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.338" offset="813349">This was the form of the grievance procedure language in the agreement of March 1957, which was the first agreement with which we're concerned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.618" offset="874371">During that time -- term of that agreement, there arose a grievance filed by certain Cement Finishers, now called the Cement Finishers' grievance, who claimed that the company by contracting out certain cement finishing work had violated the terms of the agreement and specifically the recognition clause and had violated past practice which was that this kind of work should always be done by employees in the bargaining union.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.775" offset="1011043">The case was carried through the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.012" offset="1020029">The company refused to arbitrate and the union brought suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.764" offset="1043017">In the Cement Finishers' case, the union suit asked only that the claim that this action of the company violated past practice be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.621" offset="1102472">The District Court and then the Court of Appeals held that this grievance was not arbitrable under the then state of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.502" offset="1137998">The Court of Appeals relied particularly upon the then Fifth Circuit decision in the Warrior &amp; Gulf case as well as in the First Circuit's decision of the Local 201 case, which said that no grievance was arbitrable unless the Court could find a governing provision in the contract which would guide the arbitrator to dispose of the grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.882" offset="1239458">That decision came down in March 1960, whereas this Court on June 20th, 1960 reversed the Warrior &amp; Gulf decision of the Fifth Circuit and impliedly, though not specifically, reversed the rule announced by Judge Magruder in the First Circuit which have been relied upon by the Court of Appeals and set down the rule which has been followed in the federal courts ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.984" offset="1355860">Subsequent to the Court's decision, this Court's decision in March of 1960, two things happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.905" offset="1387520">First, the parties then extended their agreement -- excuse me, a new agreement without changing the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.208" offset="1420748">That occurred in August 1960 and in October 1960, what I will call the Crane Operators' grievance arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.623" offset="1458469">The company contracted out certain crane operation work.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.716" offset="1478844">The union filed a grievance and sought to have it arbitrated and the company refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.056" offset="1508206">In this case, the suit was in two parts and that is the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.770" offset="1535060">The first claim was that the company was obligated to arbitrate the union's claim that it had violated the agreement and specifically the recognition clause by giving the work, the crane work, to an outside contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.549" offset="1618129">The second paragraph of the complaint was broken into two paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.428" offset="1637669">Claim that the company had violated past practice, that the past practice was to have this work done by the crane operators employed by the company and the union asked that that claim be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.024" offset="1700049">After an answer was filed, a motion for summary judgment was filed by the union on paragraph 1, the complaint asking arbitration of the claim of violation of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.542" offset="1758145">The defendant company filed a motion for summary judgment asking that both paragraphs of the complaint be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.008" offset="1795971">The District Court held that the dispute was an arbitrable dispute under the decision of this Court in the Warrior &amp; Gulf and American Manufacturing cases and ordered the defendant to arbitrate the grievance, the entire grievance but it rested that entirely on paragraph 1 of the complaint and dismissed paragraph 2 as moot and denied of course the defendant's motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.398" offset="1921567">The defendant appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.211" offset="1928777">The Court of Appeals held on appeal, reversing the District Court, first, that this dispute was not an arbitrable dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.148" offset="1972558">And I will not try to paraphrase the reasoning in the Court of Appeals but basically I think it was that it could not find any governing provision in the agreement which would govern an arbitrator's disposition of the case and therefore, there was nothing to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.866" offset="2055419">It characterized as a rather strong language the union's contention that its claim that the company violated the agreement made the dispute arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.637" offset="2118531">It held as an alternate holding that the prior decision in the Cement Finishers' case constituted a collateral estoppel which prevented the union from processing this grievance or indeed any other grievance involving the contracting out of work, and this Court of course granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.580" offset="2210273">Now, if Your Honors please, I think this case is a very simple and easy case because I think it is governed fully and without reasonable possibility of distinction by the two decisions which this Court issued in June of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.749" offset="2278922">In the American Manufacturing case, this Court held that where the parties have agreed that questions of interpretation or application or claimed violation of an agreement, are to be determined by an arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.994" offset="2347886">Then when the union makes such a claim, that is that the employer violated the agreement and that the employer is wrong, action was erroneous as a matter of interpretation or application of the agreement then that claim is entitled to be arbitrated because that's what the parties have said, that any such claim shall be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.919" offset="2463660">The Court in passing on the question of arbitrability, this Court said does not have to decide whether there is merit in the grievance or whether in its view, the contract covers the grievance or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.009" offset="2519980">The question which is to be arbitrated is whether is the claim which the union has made that the company violated the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.638" offset="2562508">The measurement is not to be made in the terms of subject matter or anything else but in terms of what the union's claim is, i.e. what is the arbitrator to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.452" offset="2605767">And just so in this case, the union is asked to have arbitrated its claim that the company's action violated the agreement and this Court said, it is not part of any court's business to decide whether there is merit in that claim or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.773" offset="2683089">The Court -- the only function of the Court is to determine whether the employer has agreed to arbitrate such claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.261" offset="2728960">The other part of this case is the claim that the company violated, if it did not violate the agreement, violated a past practice, such a claim which this agreement makes it arbitrable.</text>

            <text syncTime="820.334" offset="3281293">We had Judge Magruder's theory which was then as expressed in the two, in one of the cases was cited in the first decision here that the Court had to determine for itself whether there was a term of the agreement which the arbitrator could use as a governing standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.348" offset="3357362">But of course that involves interpretation of the agreement and because there are many restrictions in an agreement which are implied not expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.743" offset="3402919">And this Court said, it is none of the Court's business to determine the nature of the standards which the arbitrator applies or whether in fact there are any at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.058" offset="3444193">Perhaps, the arbitrator will look at the case and says, “You have claimed that they violated the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.582" offset="3462269">You are unable to show me any provision of the agreement which I can find governs this agreement, and therefore this conduct is unregulated by the agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.591" offset="5498358">First of all, the claim of violation of agreement which we've been talking about wasn't involved in the Cement Finishers' case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1401.456" offset="5605773">And we think that it is clear that the -- this Court's decision in June of 1960 did make a substantial change in the law and in addition to the other reasons which we spelled out in the brief, we think the doctrine of collateral estoppel has no applicability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.306" offset="5669198">One final word, the company says that both claims are not here and I will confess that the court below, both courts below, regarded this whole case and the question is, does the company oblige to arbitrate the question of contracting out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.945" offset="5747775">As I think the -- this Court's decisions in 1960 said and it's the essence of our argument, the Court does not decide whether a subject matter is arbitrable nor does the arbitrator decides subject matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1452.736" offset="5810887">There was a claim in this case that the company violated the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.012" offset="5840039">There was a claim in this case that it violated past practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.016" offset="5856026">Those are two separate claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.753" offset="5862922">The District Court regarded them as one and it found arbitrability as to one and said arbitrate the grievance, the whole grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.285" offset="5893120">The Court of Appeals operated in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.957" offset="5903778">It said those are two reasons why you arbitrate and we will reverse on both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.885" offset="5927497">Now, there are both here because the Court of Appeals directed summary judgment for company both claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.867" offset="5951425">But any question that are not here disappears when you look correctly as I think this Court's decision requiring it to do, the fact that the Court orders not a grievance arbitrator, it ordered -- it says that this issue will be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.638" offset="6022478">If the Court sustained this under the 10 (a) (1), the violation, then arbitrator will decide whether the company's action violated the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.628" offset="6050482">That's all they decided, not whether it was good, proper, fair or violated past practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.563" offset="6074201">If the Court says that the claim a violation of past practice, it's arbitrable as we think it is under parallel reasoning, then the arbitrator decides did the company's action violate past practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.733" offset="6118922">And I think that solves our problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.832" offset="6131252">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederic D. Anderson</label>
            <text syncTime="1539.383" offset="6157479">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.766" offset="6175033">I think that neither the parties nor the court below were in any disagreement basically about what this Court has held in American Manufacturing, Warrior &amp; Gulf, and the cases which followed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.006" offset="6251938">Certainly, this Court has said that it is for the Court to determine whether or not the employer has promised to arbitrate this kind of grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.100" offset="6316304">If the Court decides that the employer has so promised, then the Court must order arbitration without getting into the merits of the grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.968" offset="6371788">If the Court decides looking at the contract that there is no promise to arbitrate this kind of grievance, then the merits are not reached either in the court proceeding or in the non-existent arbitration agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.439" offset="6465724">Now, we submit that the Court in this case did exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.260" offset="6492996">A careful reading of the Court's opinion will show that it stated those principles and only those principles that it considered the sole question before it to be whether or not the company had promised to arbitrate this kind of grievance, and it found that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.070" offset="6588186">Now, we think that where we differ from the petitioner in this case is on two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.972" offset="6635833">One is that the union has said in its brief that the language of the arbitration provision in this contract, the language which the court below admittedly had to interpret to find a promise to arbitrate, the union contends that this language is indistinguishable from the arbitration provisions in American Manufacturing and in Warrior &amp; Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.713" offset="6770834">The other point at which we differ is the union's suggestion that the court below got into the merits of this grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.978" offset="6807824">We submit that the court below did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.662" offset="6830602">Now, the grievance and arbitration provisions of this contract are reprinted in the record on pages 8 through 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.619" offset="6894446">There is no dispute about the fact that the access to the grievance procedure here is exceedingly broad essentially without limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.483" offset="6941884">The article gets to the arbitration question in Section 9 and it says that if a question is not settled in the grievance procedure, the company or the union may refer the subject for arbitration and then it goes on with some provisions for the mechanics of the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.422" offset="7049613">Now, Section 10 which begins below the middle on page 11 of the transcript and occupies all of page 12 is a section which is devoted exclusively to limiting the scope of the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.414" offset="7133623">Section 10 begins with these words which govern all of Section 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.487" offset="7157864">It says as a specific limitation on the foregoing Section 9 of this Article II, the following shall be effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.798" offset="7199138">It then has four-lettered subparts to Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.384" offset="7225469">Now, part (a) begins, questions which may be referred to arbitration shall be limited to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.709" offset="7262772">Part (d) indicates a broad area of matters relating to bargaining subjects and says that those which are not covered by this agreement as to them either party shall be entitled to refuse to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.704" offset="7334766">Now, this is a very different clause than the court had to construe in looking for a promise to arbitrate in American Manufacturing and in Warrior &amp; Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.305" offset="7389205">In American Manufacturing, there was a broad promise to arbitrate and no word of exclusion or limitation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.177" offset="7428702">In Warrior &amp; Gulf, there was a broad promise to arbitrate, modified only by a phrase which said that it excluded “matters which are simply a function of management”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.496" offset="7497979">In dealing with Warrior &amp; Gulf, this Court suggested that the breadth of the arbitration clause and the very slight and very vague limitation thereon suggested that the Court, that the parties were much more concerned with having the arbitrator decide everything than they were in limiting the scope of his jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.374" offset="7597453">Now, here with a very slight arbitration clause simply saying the company or the union may refer the subject to arbitration and with almost a page and a half of limitation and exclusion and the expressed language may refuse to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.480" offset="7685851">We have a situation in which the parties were more concerned with limiting the scope of the arbitrator's power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.342" offset="7725349">Now, this particular grievance is a grievance with respect to the contracting out of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.885" offset="7755442">We submit that it is excluded from arbitration by Section 10 of Article II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.276" offset="7789087">We think this is so in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.402" offset="7801522">We think the clearest exclusion is in part (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.830" offset="7827226">Now, part (d) says that the company will bargain with resurgence, with respect to certain matters and that the company may refuse to bar -- may refuse to arbitrate with respect to any such matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.888" offset="7907474">Now, surely if the subject of contracting out is one of those matters, then the parties have said that the company is entitled to refuse to arbitrate with respect to it and we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.504" offset="7969959">It was therefore for the Court and not for the arbitrator to determine whether or not contracting out was one of those matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.247" offset="8016980">Now, in order to determine whether or not contracting out was a matter relating to rates of pay, hours of employment and other conditions of this employment -- of this -- other conditions of employment which are not covered in this agreement, the Court had to look to the agreement to see whether it was covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.859" offset="8119380">For if it had not done so, then the parties would have lost the benefit of their contract which excused them from arbitrating such matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.646" offset="8170580">Now, fortunately in this case, the Court didn't have to look all over the agreement because the union had said in the grievance where it was that it contended that this matter was covered by the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.138" offset="8240483">And it settled on Article I, Section 1 which is printed on page 8 of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.496" offset="8277891">Now, this Section is phrased almost exactly in the language of Section 9 (a) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.360" offset="8321358">Section 9 (a) which is reprinted in a footnote on page 30 of our brief provides that representatives selected by a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit shall be the exclusive representatives of all employees in such unit for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.457" offset="8433789">Looking at Article I, Section 1 which is the contract provision, which the union says deals with the matter of contracting out, it appears that is written in the same language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.671" offset="8494602">In other words, Article I simply says that the company recognizes that the union has the status which is given to it by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.550" offset="8546116">Now, it is established in this agreement that although Section 1 relates to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment, not all of those things are matters covered by this agreement because part (d) at the bottom of page 12 expressly says that some of those things are matters not covered by this agreement and that each party shall have the right to refuse to arbitrate --</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederic D. Anderson</label>
            <text syncTime="2185.792" offset="8743079">Now, the Court, therefore had to look at the contract to see whether contracting out was one of the matters not covered by the agreement or was one of the matters covered by the agreement and the Court found that it was not one of the matters covered by the agreement for four reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.707" offset="8862824">One of course is this, is the fact and it is not even slightly conclusive that there is no reference, no expressed reference to contracting out in this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.536" offset="8910054">Now secondly, there is the fact which I have just mentioned that the broad language of the statute repeated in Article I, Section 1 on page 8 of the transcript is not -- does not bring in to the agreement, everything within that language because part (d) of the bottom of page 12 of the transcript expressly said that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.203" offset="9036800">Now third, the Court looked at the bargaining history and the Court found from the bargaining history which is plain in the transcript that the union had repeatedly sought as the contract came up for renegotiation to have something put in the contract dealing with the matter of contracting out and in bargaining, the company had refused and the bargain that the parties made did not put in something on that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.778" offset="9183086">Now, the Court said that this bargaining history was not con -- not controlling but that it fortified the conclusion that the plaintiff's position was without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.582" offset="9242227">But there was one other fact which was very important from the view of the Court, and this is something which comes in to this case in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.822" offset="9283187">It comes in to this case in connection with collateral estoppel but that's not the matter with which I am dealing at this moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.280" offset="9321117">This is matter of the prior litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.246" offset="9336895">In 1957, as Mr. Feller has said, there was before the Court a grievance which was identical in its language to this one except that the job referred to was different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.347" offset="9409306">It referred to crane -- to cement finishing, this one refers to crane operating, but it was verbatim the same otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.095" offset="9448281">At that time, the provisions of Article I and Article II of the contract were verbatim the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.096" offset="9488300">At that time, the Court had before it, the question of interpreting the language of the contract to determine whether it contained a promise to arbitrate and contracting out grievance or whether or not that was one of the matters not covered in this agreement, and in that litigation, the Court adjudicated the meaning of this contract language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.707" offset="9606792">It adjudicated the fact that this language did not contain, did not mean a promise to arbitrate a contracting out grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.254" offset="9656947">Now, as Mr. Feller has said, five months after that decision adjudicating the meaning of this language, the parties entered into a new contract using the identical language, the meaning of which had been adjudicated between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.848" offset="9739389">Now, it would seem inconceivable that when the parties put their names to that language, defining and limiting the obligation to arbitrate, it would seem inconceivable that they did not mean by that language the meaning which the Court had just adjudicated between them, that language to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.736" offset="9838864">Now, for this reason -- these reasons, the Court concluded that contracting out was not a matter which was covered by this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.209" offset="9888810">The contract expressly says that each party shall have the right to refuse to arbitrate such -- any such matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.338" offset="9925277">We did refused and therefore the Court held that we did not have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.037" offset="9948056">Now, this does not mean that the Court of Appeals got into the merits of the grievance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2560.100" offset="10240313">Now, this leaves the Court with the question of discovering whether contracting out is one of the rates of pay, hours of employment or other conditions of employment which is covered by this agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3366.267" offset="13464973">And the Court essentially said that you cannot have a taxpayer who has a perpetual right to pay taxes differently than other people because he has been once successful in what has proven to be an erroneous interpretation of the tax statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3395.137" offset="13580539">There is, or should be, a national policy to minimize and avoid litigation over collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.906" offset="13619618">Now, if the parties once litigate the meaning of particular language in a collective bargaining agreement and the meaning of that language is settled, that ought permanently to be settled between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.095" offset="13684297">They shouldn't be able to harass each other and take up the Court's time with litigation and re-litigation of it for the contract is going to expire after a brief interval and the parties are going to have a full opportunity to change that language if they intend a different meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.857" offset="13767367">Now, keeping unions and companies out of court is a primary reason why it is that collateral estoppel which should be applied and is applied on so restricted basis in tax cases should be applied in a very liberal basis, on collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.671" offset="13862661">We think the cases in our brief show that it is applied liberally on contract interpretation questions generally, a fortiori should be so on collective bargaining agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3859.248" offset="15436904">Mr. Anderson says, the question is whether there was a promise to arbitrate a contracting out grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.131" offset="15464490">The question is whether questions of contracting out can be arbitrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.399" offset="15481522">The reason we get into this problem as to what's here is that too many people have talked in those terms.</text>
