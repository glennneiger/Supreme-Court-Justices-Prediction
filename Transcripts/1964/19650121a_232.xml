            <label>Mr. Robert B. Hummel</label>
            <text syncTime="59.968" offset="239804">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.927" offset="251611">This is a direct appeal from the dismissal of Count I of a two-count indictment by the District Court of the District of Massachusetts, Chief Judge Sweeny.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.117" offset="292467">The appeal is directly to this Court under the Criminal Appeals Act since the dismissal was based solely on the Court's construction of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.394" offset="333531">The appellees are the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad and three individuals, who held the positions which I shall describe during the pertinent period, Patrick B. McGinnis who was president and director of that railroad, George F. Glacy and Daniel A. Benson, both vice-presidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.477" offset="409809">The charge was laid under Section 10 of the Clayton Act and, in essence, it was that the appellees -- the appellee, Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, with the aid of and direct participation of the individual appellees, sold 10 railway cars to a company known as International Railway Equipment Corporation without competitive bidding which, in our view, was required by Section 10 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.779" offset="551079">We postulate the requirement for competitive bidding on the ground that there existed the interlocking relationships which Section -- Section 10 requires when a railroad is dealing in its own property or in supplies and equipment with another company.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.173" offset="636656">Statute provides the following types of interlocking relationships give rise to the necessity for competitive bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.017" offset="680020">On the part of the carrier, if the person is a director, president, manager, purchasing or selling officer, or agent in a particular transaction and, on the part of the other company, if he is at the same a director, manager, purchasing or selling officer, or has any substantial interest in the other corporation, firm, partnership, or association, then the requirement for competitive bidding arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.553" offset="814184">And, in this case, the narrow question is, the meaning of the place, any substantial interest since there's no allegation that the individual appellees held a position as director managing or purchasing or selling officer with the International Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.598" offset="890358">Our position, in brief, is that if the other firm, the firm with whom the railroad is dealing, is being operated in substantial part for the benefit of the carrier officials who hold the position with the railroad specified in the statute, in that event, carrier officers have a substantial interest in the company and the need for competitive bidding follows.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert B. Hummel</label>
            <text syncTime="253.982" offset="1015850">Well, the bribe case, we think, presents a slightly different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.839" offset="1039256">It might depend on the kind of a bribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.465" offset="1049809">If it were a promise of stock to be delivered 20 days after the transaction had taken place, I think it would be -- it would give, perhaps, the bribee very clearly an equitable stock interest in the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.258" offset="1113025">It might not be a --</text>

            <text syncTime="281.445" offset="1125773">Cash payment would raise, perhaps to attenuated a -- an -- an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.674" offset="1150642">I'm not sure it would be substantial -- a substantial interest in that event, although I think, in a -- in appropriate circumstances, it might be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.723" offset="1190870">If you could show a course of dealings which would indicate that the person taking the bribe had a real solid expectation of additional bribes, I think it might meet the -- the test.</text>

            <text syncTime="332.432" offset="1329633">And, the allegation of the indictment is that there was a scheme and arrangement, under which the individual appellees would direct property to the International Company and, in return for that, when the International Company made, for the purpose of producing profits for International and that they would then subsequently receive substantial moneys, now --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="376.625" offset="1506429">Well I understand -- I understand your point that if the bribe were in the form of shares of common stock of the bribing corporation, that would be a substantial interest because that meets the common ordinary sense of that term “substantial interest,” a proprietary interest, an ownership interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.457" offset="1581767">But, that was not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.832" offset="1587304">This was money and why wasn't it simply a bribe as my brother Goldberg has suggested.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert B. Hummel</label>
            <text syncTime="403.908" offset="1615621">-- that calling it a bribe may not mean that they didn't have a substantial interest in the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.741" offset="1634952">And, if I may, I'd like to turn to Count II of the indictment from which it appears that International's business for the year in which this transaction took place amounted to some $480,000, almost all of which was in the property of the Boston &amp; Maine River.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.448" offset="1721783">It also appears in that count that the International paid for the railway cars which were involved with a postdated check, I think in fair inference, being that the check was postdated because they expected to make it good out of the resale to the Wabash Railroad which was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.183" offset="1816660">And, in those circumstances, it seems to me that we have what amounts to a joint enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.087" offset="1848320">You can call it bribe if you wish, but it seems to me that the International Company and the individual appellees were so closely aligned and the interest of the individual appellees were so tied to the success of the enterprise that they had for purposes of a conflict of interest situation which is what we believe the statute deals with, a substantial interest of the corporation.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="494.522" offset="1977992">The defendant was silent partly, is that your theory?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_b_hummel" startTime="497.241" stopTime="736.589">
            <label>Mr. Robert B. Hummel</label>
            <text syncTime="497.241" offset="1988963">I think that's quite true.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.882" offset="2003487">The alternative to that is the appellee's position which is apparently that the statute covers only a stock interest and what the Court described as a “then present legal interest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="517.169" offset="2068584">This seems to exclude illegal interests, future interests, equitable interests, contingent interests, all of which it seems to us are fully met in terms of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.652" offset="2122606">Once it is appreciated that the statute is dealing with a conflict of interest situation, I've already described the -- some of the elements of the offense and let me -- let me just recapitulate and let me read from the Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.912" offset="2219572">The Court said that the statute is limited to one who has a then present legal interest in the buying corporation and does not include one whose only interest is in the outcome of what may have been an illegal and illicit plan to siphon off, for his personal benefit, property of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad through the medium of International.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.308" offset="2317166">Now, it seems to me that that concept of using International as a medium quite clearly distinguishes this case from the bribe case, although as I said I think the bribe case could straight bribery -- straight cash bribe could still come within the terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.257" offset="2440986">We believe that when one construes the words “substantial interest” in the context of this statute, it is all important to appreciate that the statute is a conflict of interest statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.263" offset="2505038">Now, the arguments I've made that this is a controlled statute that is an antitrust statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.731" offset="2526877">We agree that it's an antitrust statute and it does have elements of control but, on the face of the statute, seems to us quite clear, that Congress was dealing with the problem of conflicts of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.013" offset="2579958">It doesn't regulate relationships between railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.264" offset="2600960">It regulates relationships between railroads and people who deal with the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.399" offset="2629590">And, it seems to me that this is the all important factor of this statute in appreciating what the expression “any substantial interest” was designed to cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.733" offset="2674834">The word “interest” can have very broad meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.624" offset="2686433">We're -- appellees suggest that we're arguing simply an alliance of general concern what a benefit of another corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.011" offset="2740036">We don't suggest that meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.043" offset="2748082">We suggest the meaning which is quite concrete in the context of conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.470" offset="2773786">Rules as to the conflict -- as to conflicts of interests are well known in the law, were laid down many, many years ago are traceable to the Bible that one man can serve -- cannot serve two masters.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.936" offset="2827703">In this case, it seems quite clear to us that the relationship described as the arrangement and scheme put the individual appellees, McGinnis and Glacy, in the position of serving two masters.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.448" offset="2897711">This is -- this context of conflict of interest, if there were any doubt about it on the face of the statute, it seems to us, is quite clearly indefinitely established by the legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="744.736" offset="2978900">The second count was brought under 18 U.S.C. Section 660 which expressly covered this situation, an officer of a carrier stealing money from it, and that covers it.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.860" offset="3027383">It covers it explicitly, expressly.</text>

            <text syncTime="773.548" offset="3094152">The elements are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.213" offset="3100839">In this case, it isn't necessary for the government to prove that Boston &amp; Maine did not receive a fair price for the cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.022" offset="3136052">In the Section 660 case, we would have to prove that element.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.732" offset="3154860">All we need to prove here is that there was a substantial interest and that there was no competitive bidding.</text>

            <text syncTime="797.962" offset="3191745">That's the basic difference between the counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.047" offset="3208150">And, I may also say that, as construed by the lower Court, the statute virtually serves no purpose of protecting against conflicts of interests which makes this matter one of intense concern to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.594" offset="3282338">Going back to the legislative history, it arose out of -- the statute arose out of disclosures of railroad mismanagement, manipulation, and intricate web of financial interlocks of all kinds between railroads and banking houses, and railroads and supply corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.525" offset="3358093">We've set that forth in some detail in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.847" offset="3371363">President Wilson delivered a message to the Congress in which he asked, and I quote, for legislation which would prohibit “those who borrow and those who lend are practically one and the same, those who sell and those who buy the same persons trading with one another under different names and in different combinations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="866.414" offset="3465613">Now, it seems to us that, in this case, we have the buyer and the seller being practically the same person.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.879" offset="3499468">The House Bill which was passed in response to President Wilson's message simply outlawed the holding of certain positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.606" offset="3542413">It prohibited carrier officers from holding certain positions in other corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.311" offset="3569162">When the Bill came to the Senate, the Senate approved the House purpose but made some changes in the Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.462" offset="3601763">With respect to the House purpose, the committee report said that the Bill was “mainly intended to arrest the practice of the same persons occupying conflicting and incompatible relations in the corporate dealings of common carriers often being practically both buyer and seller.”</text>
            <text syncTime="922.901" offset="3691520">Now, the Senate -- Senate changed the -- the mechanics of the Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.141" offset="3708552">Instead of outlawing the holding of the positions, it required that when the positions existed there'd be competitive bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.212" offset="3748780">It then noted that the Bill, while it prohibited certain positions, had a gaping loophole in it, and it added to the House Bill the following expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.051" offset="3800189">“Has any direct or indirect interest in” the other firm.</text>

            <text syncTime="1092.441" offset="4369763">It's this, and it does relate to the so-called anomaly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.401" offset="4385541">Even if the International Company did not cheat the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad in this transaction, there was a preference given in the sale of these cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.332" offset="4433293">International's competitors were deprived of the fair opportunity to buy the 10 railroad cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.506" offset="4453982">It was a substantial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.840" offset="4463282">Railroads at the time this statute was passed and today are charged with aggregation -- of being aggregations of huge amounts of capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.195" offset="4516780">They sell it from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.898" offset="4523572">They sell tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.994" offset="4531931">They sell used equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.725" offset="4538828">They buy in large quantities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.782" offset="4547082">And, those purchases and sales could have a definite effect on the industries with which the railroad is dealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.267" offset="4576967">In this case, for example, it appears from Count II that a Mr. Bugby, a dealer in used railway equipment, first came to the Boston &amp; Railroad-- Boston &amp; Maine Railroad and tried to get an option for $500,000 to buy these cars with the expectation that he would resell them to the Wabash Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.051" offset="4660140">Now, he was turned away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.438" offset="4669649">Employees of the Boston &amp; Maine were instructed by individual appellees not to deal with him and, to this extent, fair competition was interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.699" offset="4710713">This point is also made by the remedy which Congress applied in this situation a competitive bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.982" offset="4743837">And, the statute also provides that if anyone interferes with that competitive bidding, he is to be treated as an aider and abettor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.219" offset="4788872">We derive from the point that this is a conflict of interest statute certain conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.154" offset="4812591">First of all, that it doesn't matter whether the interest which the individual appellees had in the International Company is a legally enforceable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.937" offset="4855745">Obviously, if it isn't legally enforceable, it's large or it's entirely because there was a conflict of interest involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.620" offset="4886465">I think if they had not been employees or officers of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, it would've been a legal interest, a kind of a finder's arrangement that they would find the property and it would be resold and they would share in the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.952" offset="4943726">The same thing applies to the stock interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.961" offset="4959817">What is there about a stock interest which would make it a particular concern in a conflict of interest statute but not make other interest of concern?</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.836" offset="4995344">It can't be the vote in the corporation because the conflict exists because of the pecuniary financial benefit which the officers had in the other corporation, not in their power to control its activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1382.032" offset="5528033">But, nonetheless, the factor of conviction would serve some purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.193" offset="5552692">First of all, it would alert the stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.778" offset="5563037">He will direct their attention to the fact that their corporation had been guilty of violating the law and might perhaps spark a stockholder's rebellion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.171" offset="5600653">The mere fact that certain individuals had been convicted would be something that the corporation might be able to pass off as a matter in which they have not participated, they had not been in on the defense and the corporation, itself, had done nothing wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.489" offset="5661884">Moreover, we suggest that placing the liability on the corporation makes it the duty of all the officers who are interested in the corporation's welfare to be aware of the fact that, even though they may be convinced the corporation is not being cheated that, they have to watch preferences in the sale of the property -- the sale of railroad's property, and this brings back the antitrust purpose that because, it seems quite clear to me, that even if no one had been cheated, the individual officers would have an interest in protecting the corporation from being fined, that is the individual innocent officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.142" offset="5816529">They would make it their business to find out the activities of other officers as an ancillary means of enforcing statute that seems to me to be reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2176.634" offset="8706508">I was about to say that these relationships that I describe speak in terms, really, of contract or agreements or arrangement with somebody in the outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.664" offset="8742557">Perhaps the term “arrangement” and “concert of actions” speaks in terms of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.546" offset="8774113">Again, in which these men, Glacy, Benson, and McGinnis, they're not within this corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.139" offset="8804519">They have no position of control within it, no ownership of any kind within it, but they are using it for which, if this indictment is sustained, as the government claims, they receive bribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.445" offset="8869721">And, I should like also to emphasize that much of my brother's argument is based upon facts which are alleged in Count II which are no part of Count I, which are -- which are not incorporated into Count I in any way and if there's anything clear under the decisions of this Court is that an indictment-- the count in an indictment stands on its own bottom and not with relation to other counts in the declara -- in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.435" offset="8989675">I think it's quite important in this instance to have that in mind because the government's procured another indictment within the last month against these same men and alleging the same things that are alleged in these particulars, but the Count II -- there's no Count II there like this Count II.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.880" offset="9059474">So, I say that the Court should not construe Count I as incorporating in anyway of allegations of Count II, unless they want every -- every time this allegation is made for us to have to come up here and decide whether or not it connects with another count.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.541" offset="9130109">It means something different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.077" offset="9140245">Now -- so, I say that this falls short of alleging anything which, in common definition, common understanding, amounts to an interest in a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.355" offset="9201371">The first branch of my argument is, of course, that this is a criminal statute and, as such, should be strictly construed, as Mr. Justice Black indicated in his question to my brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.369" offset="9261453">And, it is also important that the language be of sufficient clarity to inform individuals of the kind of things that they're not forbidden to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2892.138" offset="11568483">And, I -- I -- it is very important that this is an anti-trust statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.269" offset="11597009">This was passed 50 years ago in response to a message from President Wilson, and that it was -- it was designed to supplement the Sherman Act and other -- other antitrust Acts and was to nip in the butt, as the cases have said, or in its -- or to prevent in its incipiency conspiracies and so forth in restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.541" offset="11710067">And, there were certain wrongs of certain evils which were pointed out by President Wilson in his message and -- and in the reports of the committee both of the House and Senate in connection with this major.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.811" offset="11759177">One was tying clauses in contracts, another was holding companies, and another was interlocking and price -- and price discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.928" offset="11831693">The original House Bill dealt with the interlocking evil by forbidding it altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.062" offset="11864189">The House Bill forbid interlocking altogether and made it a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.521" offset="11886028">The Senate felt that that was too drastic in connection with railroads and parties -- and companies with whom they dealt, and substituted this bidding, this requirement for competitive bidding, believing that that was adequate to cover the evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.488" offset="11961887">And, when they did that, the statute merely related to interlocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.150" offset="12008594">It had no provision about substantial interests, but the Senate believed that there was an opportunity for evasion -- ready evasion, by having some relative or your lawyer on the Board instead, and so they suggest -- suggested that, to prevent that evasion, they would make -- put in this clause about, first they said, direct or indirect interest, and then in conference it was changed to “any substantial interest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.563" offset="12122175">And, I submit that, in that history of the -- of the statute, it is directed against a particular form of conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.848" offset="12183301">It is not a conflict of interest statement -- statute like these others that I have referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.749" offset="12206916">It is not a general conflict of interest statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.482" offset="12221858">It is a conflict of intereststatute which consists of interlocking or of measures taken to evade the interlocking provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.642" offset="12282567">I have of course argued, as the Boston &amp; Maine have argued even more eloquently in their brief, that the statute, stated in such general terms as substantial interest, should not be stretched into an implausible and unusual meaning, particularly where the effect of it is to impose upon the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, an innocent party, the liability -- criminal liability for acts and conduct for which, in the very nature of things, they would be unaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.682" offset="12418717">Admittedly, the statute does make the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad liable when the acts are committed where there is an interlocking, perhaps the Senate or perhaps Congress assumed that there would be means by which a railroad would know about interlocking, perhaps even of stock interests in other companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.244" offset="12504921">But, the argument is not that that cannot be done but that it is -- but that the statute ought not to be stretched, so to speak, to give an unusual meaning to the term “interest” in a corporation or other business entity when the effect of it would be to make an innocent railroad liable for conduct against its own interest which they could not possibly be made aware.</text>
