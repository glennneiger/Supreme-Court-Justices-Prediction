            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="14.605" offset="58410">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.274" offset="77009">At the conclusion of yesterday's session, Justice Black asked several questions relating to the power of the United States to change the boundaries of the State and relating to the relationship, if any, between the political boundaries of the State and inland waters and its ownership of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.119" offset="180454">And I thought it would be helpful since some of those perhaps go to assumptions that lay behind what I was saying that I failed make articulate that I would begin this morning but seeking to answer what I understand to be those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.579" offset="238237">But first with the respect to the constitutional power of the United States, once a state is admitted as a member of the Union then its political boundaries cannot be changed by Congress without the consent of the State except conceivably by some exercise as a treaty making power in which we were forced to see property.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.187" offset="344712">That was decided or stated in Mississippi against Louisiana, 202 U.S. 1 at 40, I was then speaking of political boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.784" offset="391105">Second, Congress may not take the property with which a state enters the Union except perhaps by the exercise of the right of eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.310" offset="445231">Third, we assume that Congress may not be what children use to call Indian givers.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.325" offset="473234">That is if it yields property to the State with no strings attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.800" offset="491102">Now, we take it but it may not take that property back except by an exercise of the power of eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.494" offset="529972">It seems to us that none of those questions are involved in this case for at least three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.291" offset="569156">But first, we say and I will elaborate fine a little later, that California's political boundaries never did include and do not include the areas that are in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.401" offset="625580">And second, we say that California's inland waters never included at the areas in dispute even if those areas were within her political boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.947" offset="687752">In other words, inland waters are the outer limit of inland waters and coast line are not synonyms for political boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.490" offset="733936">And Pollard and Hagan, the right, property right that Pollard and Hagan carried to the property under inland waters did not carry a right to the property under the sea all the way out to the political boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.750" offset="802900">Consequently, boundaries as I say do not necessarily coincide with coast line.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.824" offset="827246">They may coincide.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.113" offset="836441">The boundaries may go beyond the coast line and it is possible that the boundaries limit where the coast line may be but that is not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.628" offset="878446">Now, I suggest that those problems are necessarily true.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.453" offset="893806">Both ended the decision in the United States against California and under the Submerged Lands Act, but first as United States v. California.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.924" offset="935602">In that case, California's political boundaries unquestionably extended three miles beyond the coast line.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.761" offset="971024">Indeed, California's argument as stated by the Court was that her political boundaries as she was admitted to the Union extended three miles from the coast line and the Court held that nevertheless the United States had the paramount property rights in the three-mile strip and so that it cannot thought, have thought of the two as coinciding.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.839" offset="1075304">In the Louisiana case that followed the California case, the Court said, the matter of state boundaries has no bearing on the present problem because -- and indeed in the Texas case where it was argued with Texas came in to the Union with political boundaries as the result of a treaty going beyond the three-mile limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.064" offset="1168196">Now, the Court said, even if they did, Texas surrendered whatever ownership she had had out to her political boundary and came in with any rights to the property under the sea limited to the three-mile strip.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.440" offset="1229740">And I think that the second Texas and Florida cases extending the grant holding that the grant under the Submerged Lands Act went out to the political boundaries of those states as they were admitted up to three -- up to the limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.927" offset="1303615">Certainly, it did not hold that the inland waters of those states went out to the original political boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.887" offset="1335484">Indeed, the decree defines it all in terms of a distance from inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.690" offset="1354710">So again, they couldn't have been taken to be co-extensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.095" offset="1376340">If you look at the Submerged Lands Act, again, it seems to me entirely clear that Congress assumed that the political boundaries and the coast line, which of course includes the outer limit of inland water, could be very different things that these were not identical concept and I notice last night, the number of points which make that very plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.983" offset="1487830">The first I may refer to the text to the statute again in the back of my brief on page 2 a, Section 2 (a) (2), which happens to fall in 2 (a), defines lands beneath navigable waters to mean all lands permanently or periodically covered by tidal waters up to but not above the line of mean high tide and seaward to a line three geographical miles distant from the coast line of each state, there's one expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.368" offset="1629414">And to the boundary line of such State, there's another and different expression where in any case such boundary had existed at the time such State became a member of the Union or it's heretofore approved by Congress, extends seaward beyond three geographical miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.762" offset="1702975">Of course, that means three geographical miles from the coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.474" offset="1717812">So, if the Congress must have thought they were different.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.141" offset="1732545">Again, Section 2 (b), the last half of it, “but in no event shall the term 'boundaries' or the term 'lands beneath navigable waters' be interpreted as extending from the coast line more than three geographical miles into the Atlantic or the Pacific or more than three marine leagues into the Gulf.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.279" offset="1821048">Well now, there again, you find the two expressions.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.107" offset="1836408">It's all the more important to this case because this was put in as a limitation against an anticipated to extraordinary claim as to where the political boundaries were located.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.989" offset="1887922">And of course, it wouldn't be a limitation, if coast line meant political boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.521" offset="1905998">You'd be defining one -- you'd be defining the limit in terms of the very thing that you were trying to cut off, then again, if you look over at Section 4 which does have to do with the political boundaries of the State rather than its ownership of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.382" offset="1985515">Now first, the seaward boundary be it original the coastal state is approved at three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.969" offset="2007876">Then any State admitted subsequent to the formation of the Union which is not already done so, may extend its seaward boundaries to align three geographical miles from the coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.510" offset="2053956">Now, the point is the same when I was trying to make before under these are contrasting usages and not equivalents.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.794" offset="2083109">And a little further on, it speaks of its doing this without prejudice to its claim, if any, it has, that its boundaries extend beyond that line which is a line three miles from the coast line and therefore, the political boundary can't be conceived of as being the same thing as the coast line.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="543.354" offset="2173388">Well, I think what it's speaking of boundary, it means political boundary quite clearly.</text>

          <turn speaker="hugo_l_black" startTime="548.306" stopTime="551.965">
            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="548.306" offset="2193136">I have looked at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.192" offset="2196689">I was just wondering you have mentioned that word anyway.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="551.965" stopTime="605.281">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="551.965" offset="2207765">It does not use the term political boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.843" offset="2219363">It uses the term boundary in such a way I submit as to make it clear that it is talking about political boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.798" offset="2251128">But it does not use the word political because it speaks to the boundaries as which it's submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.700" offset="2270772">And indeed that of course was the whole point that the decision in the United States against California said that ownership and political boundaries don't go together.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.027" offset="2328033">That the United States owns thing in this soil that are within the political boundaries of the State and the purpose of the Act was up to this three miles from the coast line limit to restore that equivalence of political boundaries and ownership but up to the limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.362" offset="2413401">I emphasize that.</text>

            <label>Justice Arthur J. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="605.281" offset="2421029">Mr. Solicitor General, what is difference between that the rights under this Section 7 or Section 4?</text>
            <text syncTime="612.440" offset="2449659">You said, nothing was on the undisputed question (Inaudible).</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="634.435" stopTime="709.357">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="634.435" offset="2537639">Well, I think it's had -- as I read it, it had several consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.025" offset="2564075">First and probably the most important, was to protect the Gulf States which we're claiming more than three miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.817" offset="2603259">Second, I think that as you read the whole thing, it becomes clear that this section is talking about political boundaries and not about ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.326" offset="2657280">That is the whole sense of Section 4 and that this simply says, “Well, this Act can't affect any claim to wider political boundaries that the State may have had.”</text>
            <text syncTime="676.344" offset="2705345">And it -- that seems to me Mr. Justice, to be what it means all the way through.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.338" offset="2733349">Furthermore, even if I'm wrong in that, I don't think I am but assuming that I am.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.602" offset="2766367">Then I think the most affect that it can be given is that this is part of the purpose of leaving some things where they found them and leaving the question of what inland waters is for example where they found it.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.102" offset="2816313">But I think it really relates only to political boundaries.</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="709.357" offset="2837420">I didn't recall using the word political boundaries in the California case, did they?</text>

          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="715.717" stopTime="822.537">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="715.717" offset="2862811">I guess not expressly sir, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.634" offset="2874514">But you spoke of the boundaries that which she had been admitted and you said that they did not fix what she owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.319" offset="2917251">I think that's quite clear from -- indeed that was the holding of the case necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.199" offset="2940761">And I used political boundaries in an effort to contrast boundaries as it was there used with ownership of property which is a -- it was held in that case to be an entirely different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.572" offset="3006276">Now, the third reason I say that the question of the power of Congress to cut off the states ownership is not involved in this case is simply that the Submerged Lands Act does not purport to take anything away from the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.599" offset="3078374">It purports it can grant them something.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.990" offset="3087882">It purports to grab them the ownership of the submerged lands out to a certain limit and whether their boundaries extend beyond that limit is irrelevant because they did not own it anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.154" offset="3156532">Even so they're boundaries did extend beyond that limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.400" offset="3169593">So, that brings us back I think to the fundamental question.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.493" offset="3197910">First, as I sought to argue yesterday, the case turns on what is the meaning of ‘inland waters' in the Submerged Lands Act and I was arguing, indeed I spent most of yesterday arguing the next point and that is that the term ‘inland waters' was used in the Submerged Lands Act to carry forward this status quo that was set.</text>

            <text syncTime="1160.091" offset="4640287">We're giving back to people what they always thought they owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.731" offset="4650841">It was not anything that was used to precisely to the extent that it had a precise meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.499" offset="4685949">I think it was quite clearly not related to specific areas but related to a theory of law, the theory that Pollard and Hagan applied within the -- to the three-mile strip within territorial waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.530" offset="4746031">Although it also related to a theory at least in the Gulf that the Pollard and Hagan rule applied out to these states boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.481" offset="4793887">But in the Louisiana case, the Court -- the second Louisiana case, the Court made it quite clear that what the Submerged Lands Act was doing was restoring as it was said in the Congress a relationship between territorial waters and the State's ownership property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.552" offset="4878106">Now, the second thing that is quite clear is that there was no intent to give every coastal state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.786" offset="4903079">Whatever the State's lawyers might claim that it could show that the state had once thought it owned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1237.080" offset="4948219">Louisiana didn't get what is says it thought it owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.252" offset="4964937">It also was made quite clear in the colloquy that I read yesterday between Senator Holland and Senator Douglas and later Senator Holland and Senator Kuchel that there was no purpose here to give California the waters of this overall unit, south of that Point Conception that that was being left there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.131" offset="5052500">They thought it was a pretty bad claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.492" offset="5061904">If the Supreme Court did something surprising and gave it to California, so she won alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.310" offset="5085205">If they did what she expected in California laws is alright and there's simply no purpose to change the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.048" offset="5112163">And finally, this clause to which I've referred so often, the final clause to Section 2 (b) is perfectly, plainly a limitation that says that more than three-mile -- you don't get more than three miles from the coast line regardless of what you can show about what you expected your boundaries would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.033" offset="5188127">And the history shows that it was put in for that purpose to cut off any claims based on what people thought their boundaries might be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1366.177" offset="5464607">My second main point is that the term ‘inland waters' as used in prior decisions, specifically United States of California but also the Texas and Louisiana case, refers to the waters over which a nation asserts exclusive sovereignty for the purposes of international relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.318" offset="5557185">I really argued this point yesterday and arguing the first point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3119.767" offset="12479007">Now, as to the principles that the Master replied, the first principle when as the State Department states it, the Master found it and way of we think always replied it, is the territorial waters begin at the low water line along relatively straight coast?</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.645" offset="12558524">As I understand it, there is no dispute about the general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.337" offset="12577332">There is a dispute about whether the low water line means as we think it does the average of all low waters or whether it means its California thinks it does on this coast whether of two types, two different heights of tides whether it names the average of the lower waters, that intriguing detail I leave to my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.808" offset="12679210">The second rule comes to what Mr. Justice Black was just raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.403" offset="12709512">We say that on coast with minor curvatures, not amounting to bays which I will define very exactly later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.219" offset="12748800">Not amounting to bays, the territory or other estuaries, harbors and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.928" offset="12771683">The territorial sea, that's the coast line, begins at the low water line, alright, and its inner and outer boundaries, if necessarily, follow the sinuosities of the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.330" offset="12837303">Unlike instead of going point to point subject to the exception about bays as we defend which I will come.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.985" offset="12871889">I could illustrate this very quickly on this map which shows up in different colors here that it did in my office, that's the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.699" offset="12918700">We say that the coast that the marginal sea, the territorial sea, is the light blue line and plus the dark blue line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.832" offset="12987246">In other words, it follows around the sinuosities in each island has its own territorial sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.854" offset="13023399">We put San Francisco Bay in dark blue because it does meet the definition of bay and is landlocked within what we understand to be the meaning of landlocked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.871" offset="13079406">And therefore at that point, the line would go across roughly under the Golden Gate Bridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.061" offset="13116186">Now, as a corollary to that proposition, we say that territorial waters and therefore the outer inland -- outer limit of inland waters begins at the low water line around islands and within straits that connect areas of the open sea and you'll see here that we have a three-mile belt around each of the islands, and that we show Santa Barbara Channel which is begins at Point Conception and runs east.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.108" offset="13252336">We show in red because it connects what we understand the areas of the open sea.</text>

            <text syncTime="3379.356" offset="13517322">Now, the Special Master accepted these three rules as he said without embarrassment of doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.647" offset="13550550">He found the United States as traditionally taken the position that the baseline of the marginal belt is the lower water mark following this sinuosities coast and not drawn from headland to headland, except that its bay is not more than 10 miles wide the baseline is a straight line drawn across the opening of such indentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.283" offset="13637068">The supporting evidence is set forth in his report and that length in our brief; I think it would be a waste for the Court's time for me to attempt to go through it because it does have to be looked at very precisely with emphasis upon the exact words and the incidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.932" offset="13723690">I would call your attention particularly to the statement of Secretary of State Baird in 1886, where he very clearly sets forth this rule applying it to islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.384" offset="13777502">It's interesting because at that time, he was speaking of our own coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.164" offset="13800594">Most of our history we've been engaged in debates about other people's coast lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.939" offset="13823687">There he was speaking of our own coast line in Alaska and he said, “If we're going to take the position Atlantic, for six-mile bays as it was then, and that they can't go headland to headland then we've got to agree over in Alaska and the Pacific that we are bound by the same rules, and that's essentially on the broad the position that we're advocating here as a matter of very important current policy of the United States, I may say.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.079" offset="13948238">This is not just a matter of heads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.584" offset="13966315">California, argues in favor of what she calls straight baseline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.607" offset="13998393">She says that whatever coast is indented or whether there are islands that you leap from point to point and I've -- these show up so far as the areas in this case is concerned and the first at Monterey Bay where she wants jump across.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.163" offset="14076552">Then she gets down San Luis Obispo and she wants a straight line there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.301" offset="14101107">Then when she gets Point Conception, she says, “We've jumped 21 miles or 24 miles out to San Miguel and then we jumped around from island to island, point to point.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.934" offset="14163696">Now as I understand that her straight baseline and the reason what I did and the upper part of the coast was project this theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.148" offset="14196506">I did -- I do emphasize my projection, California does not necessarily take that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.130" offset="14220434">I was just trying to show how it would work out if applied consistently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.515" offset="14241959">She bases the -- her argument on two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.361" offset="14269440">On the Norwegian Fisheries case that decided in the early 1950's and the Geneva Convention which we've referred to before which was signed in 1958 ratified by us in '61.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.003" offset="14339971">The Geneva Convention states that in localities where the shoreline is deeply indented and cut into or if there's fringe of violence along the coast, then the method of straight baseline joining appropriate points may be employed in drawing the baseline from which the breadth to the territorial sea is to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.961" offset="14439758">Now, we say that that provision in the Geneva Convention is irrelevant for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.926" offset="14467657">In the first place, we say that the Act was enacted in 1953 and was a grant as of that time, a grant in present and that -- from then on, only the rules of property law, boundary law apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.079" offset="14552294">Second, we said the California Coast does not by the wildest stretch of the imagination meet the description in the Norwegian Fisheries case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.080" offset="14600255">If you look at the big map instead of a few super impositions of particular areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.421" offset="14621675">You'll see that the two coasts aren't comparable at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.902" offset="14631602">My friend Mr. Hayes here, he may have an argument that his coast to somewhat likely Norwegian Coast, California Coast, we think it's the altogether different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.586" offset="14674338">But the third and much the most important reason is that the straight baseline method is permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.142" offset="14708506">Its states what a state made of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.246" offset="14720940">It steps in the very language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.359" offset="14729404">It says that straight baselines may be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.668" offset="14746645">And there is another Section immediately after this or sentence which says, “The coastal state must clearly indicate straight baseline on charts to which due publicity must be given.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.812" offset="14799203">Now, the United States has never applied the straight baseline method ever --</text>

            <text syncTime="4122.340" offset="16489326">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.305" offset="16493192">And that illustration of an historic bay is Chesapeake Bay, now there is Delaware Bay and they are bays as historic bays because we've always exercise jurisdiction of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.475" offset="16537809">The points on which we stand here because first, we say that since we are dealing with matters of external policy or international relations, it require some action by the United States to assert sovereignty over these areas to make them into a bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.897" offset="16639582">Now, like what California may have done or may not have done, is not sufficient to make the body of the water an historic bay within the international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.020" offset="16692036">Now, the Master dealt with this very effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.483" offset="16713874">I would simply emphasize two things -- fir -- three really.</text>
            <text syncTime="4185.313" offset="16741251">But first with would respect to these bays, California has parts to only one instance with respect to Monterey Bay and one instance with respect to Santa Monica Bay, in which she actually exercise in a jurisdiction over those.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.848" offset="16827350">Even in the sense that one would exercise them over territorial waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.811" offset="16847203">She never did any others, actually.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.448" offset="16857757">With respect to San Pedro Bay, California never did anything or San Luis Obispo so far as we know.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.196" offset="16888686">The only thing she cites with respect to San Pedro Bay is a distinct -- is a decision by a federal district judge dismissing an indictment which required the crime of piracy to be committed on the high sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.531" offset="16950021">Well, that certainly was the claim of sovereignty by anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.020" offset="16960052">He was dismissing an indictment and of course, what he did was the very practical thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.539" offset="16978129">He convicted the defendant on three other counts of a crime that was a crime regardless of the status of the waters, so that I don't think that can be made into claim with jurisdiction by California but not only where these very fragmentary things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.786" offset="17047092">There were things directed against the Americans or American Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.578" offset="17070289">They have no sense where things that would have come to the attention of the foreign policy making parts of the United States, so that there can't be any statement of it that we failed to act even fell so our foreign relations were implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.383" offset="17129430">And third, they were things that were done contrary to what by the 1920's were they established foreign policy criteria of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4295.310" offset="17181153">And what we say is essentially, the most important is that under those circumstances a state cannot acquire for the United States territory and make it part of their territory which is sovereign to the United States in the sense of international relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.846" offset="17263282">And this is essentially what Special Master said I think in his opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="4338.081" offset="17352307">I'm saying that so far as it's actual, it is certainly supported by evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4342.485" offset="17369861">So far as it rest on the principle that a State's acts cannot acquire a territory for the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.007" offset="17408000">It's a correct rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.283" offset="17417091">The territory acquiring the foreign policy doing must be done by the federal governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.726" offset="17442900">But the Master also did find Mr. Justice Black that until 1949, California never had asserted jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.938" offset="17475709">That, we say is a factual finding and we say, that's supported by evidence and should be conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.459" offset="17505802">Now, the other point that I would like to emphasize, it goes to California's historic claims of whether they are stated in terms of boundary or whether they are stated in terms of historic bays for international purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.858" offset="17575393">And that is that California's boundaries simply do not include the areas in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.378" offset="17617502">What California has to rely on is that the statute is that her Constitution with which she was admitted in 19 -- 1849, after drawing a complete circuit in terms of an outer limit of the State's boundary which did not include these Channel Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.293" offset="17729097">Then he said after it also all islands, bays, harbors along the coasts and that's all it said, alright, and the admitting Act took her in with that Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.806" offset="17799210">Now, I don't know or what the expressions also all islands, bays and so forth meant to the people in 1849.</text>
            <text syncTime="4462.421" offset="17849678">The bays where laid -- big bays, were labeled bays on many chart that point out that the Bay of Bengal, Biscay Bay, the Bay of Fundy, Campeachy Bay are all labeled as bays on a lot of charts, but nobody contends that those are inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.618" offset="17918433">There's no indication in the California Constitution as to what they meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.285" offset="17949048">It would to seem to me that the most plausible meaning was that California was being taken in with those islands, bays, and harbors to which the United States would be entitled under the rules of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4504.830" offset="18019265">It was then applying as a matter of its external international relations and it is most improbable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4514.378" offset="18057509">Add a period when the United States was engaged in fighting for the six-mile bays with Great Britain that they would have taken California in using bays in an entirely different sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.212" offset="18124800">If anything is to be inferred, that would seem to me to be the most plausible inference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.132" offset="18152490">But I must admit I don't know anything very clear one way or the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="4659.595" offset="18638367">When you read the statutes enacted over the years by the California legislature describing the boundaries of the counties, the Constitution requires to the State to be divided into counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4674.289" offset="18697091">The county boundary lines are set forth by meets and bounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.741" offset="18718929">I think it is fair to say always in terms that suggest that these waters are not included within the meets and bounds description.</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.494" offset="18761874">And in some instances, in terms very specifically that put the state boundary are only three miles from the shore of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.850" offset="18803357">Now, this has been a long case and I'm not going to ask the Court to go through those details here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.923" offset="18827598">But I would emphasize that part of our brief because it that seems to me tremendously persuasive evidence of how the legislature itself construed the earlier State Constitution and as part of the total context of whether they ever claimed to make this historic bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4727.849" offset="18911295">I do want to emphasize, alright, just three points in this connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4735.615" offset="18942433">One is that in describing and with the Court is too good as to turn to the little map folded into our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.886" offset="18975451">In the very back, you will note the Point D about the center up with the top.</text>
            <text syncTime="4752.924" offset="19011605">Now -- no, excuse me, Point C.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.563" offset="19030204">There is one that's toward the head of San Pedro Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.839" offset="19047340">I simply want to emphasize that there is one statute enacted in the 19th century, that draws the line between Orange County which is south of White Sea in Los Angeles County to the north, and it describes it that takes C which is Coyote Creek and it describes the boundary at one point as running three miles from the center of the mouth of Coyote Creek to the Southwestern Boundary of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.599" offset="19186312">That's what I would say literally accurate that the point is the same as I make which clearly shows where that legislature thought the boundary road.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.537" offset="19222047">Now, the second point I particularly want to emphasize in this boundary description, is that there was a statute passed in 1919, cutting Ventura County off from Los Angeles County and it describes the boundaries of Los Angeles County in terms of a complete circuit with a line paralleling the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.757" offset="19330926">And then it says and also Catalina and San Clemente Islands and a three-mile line around them, which of course were the very boundaries for which we contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.197" offset="19384738">The third thing that I want to emphasize with respect to the boundary description and you need to look at the map to see this, San Nicholas Island is in Ventura County by explicit statement in a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.713" offset="19462792">Santa Barbara Island is in Santa Barbara County by explicit statement in a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.295" offset="19493094">Now, it takes -- first, I thought it couldn't be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.932" offset="19503647">It takes some imagination to get continuous lines that don't overlap.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.126" offset="19528411">It will put Santa Barbara County in Santa Barbara Santa Barbara Islands in Santa Barbara County and San Nicholas Island in Ventura.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.011" offset="19564042">You can do it Justice Goldberg with the great big J that hooks out in around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.574" offset="19582224">But if you'll read the boundaries of legislature wrote, they just can't have had in mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="4944.309" offset="19777202">-- take it down the California's premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.720" offset="19786815">I did want to talk just a little bit more about the location of these islands because that counsel has come up with the most marvelous explanation, alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.985" offset="19827879">They've got the maps in the back of this green brief which show that the army engineers and the land officers of the Department of Interior in 1887.</text>
            <text syncTime="4971.557" offset="19886184">Unlike the legislature, it knew where Santa Barbara County -- what county was it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4977.088" offset="19908336">It was in they say, all the time because nobody know at Los Angeles County.</text>
            <text syncTime="4981.817" offset="19927249">And since the island is in Los Angeles County and not Santa Barbara County, then of course, there is no difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="4989.677" offset="19958700">Well, now I wonder what would happen, if we came to Court and argued that Santa Barbara County -- what Santa Barbara Island was in Los Angeles County on that basis squarely contrary to the statutes of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.327" offset="20025260">The lines are a matter of fact, I thought I did time but I don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="5010.295" offset="20041143">The lines on those two maps if you look at them are only dotted sort of broken projections out into the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.946" offset="20083775">They do not describe a boundary running around the islands the way California's briefs as I read it, says, they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5031.021" offset="20124003">Those lines are I would think unjustified extrapolation it is either simply broken dashes with no closing line between them with at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.771" offset="20171024">Why the map make you did that?</text>
            <text syncTime="5044.727" offset="20178860">I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="5045.440" offset="20181682">The current Brad McNally commercial ad does both, it puts county lines surround the island.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.279" offset="20209058">It also has these broken lines intended to show in a general way when it went but plainly the State's statute is more important than anything that a map can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.255" offset="20429009">To begin our final portion of our argument, we would like to meet the government on exactly the ground which is chosen to argue on this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.363" offset="20461401">We were asked yesterday what would be our position if there were no Submerged Lands Act or if our basic position was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.303" offset="20493166">We have demonstrated what we believed to be the proper approach to establishing the coastline under the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.810" offset="20519184">This Court has already ruled and we believed correctly that Congress intended to measure the area involved in the Act in terms of the historic boundaries as approved by Congress and not in terms of US Foreign Relation as of 1953 or any other date.</text>
            <text syncTime="5145.502" offset="20581982">Assuming, however, either that the United States is correct in its position or that they were no Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5152.870" offset="20611448">We believe that California has shown in its brief with its claims as to inland waters are consistent with international law and a properly ascertained United States international relations practice and whatever they may be deem the proper date whether it is 1849, 1947, 1953 or today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.420" offset="20697652">As we have shown in our briefs the far over its base or other landlocked water was accepted generally long before the rule relating the three-mile limited territorial waters became crystallized.</text>
            <text syncTime="5186.650" offset="20746553">That's in 1793 Attorney General Randolph in his opinion concerning Delaware Bay, phrased the international law concerning jurisdiction over bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.201" offset="20784797">Similarly, in 1882, the Second Court of Commissioners of unit Alabama claims in the case of the Alleganian also traced the same concept in holding Chesapeake Bay to inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5207.722" offset="20830877">Now, what factors are present in the Delaware and Chesapeake Bay cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="5213.213" offset="20852820">If you gentlemen will analyze these cases, you will find that both Delaware and Chesapeake opinions are premise on certain factors all of which are equally present in the case of California's Bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.488" offset="20893884">And I want to make it clear that the purpose of this first argument, I'm talking only about the three bays, Monterey, San Pedro, and Santa Monica.</text>
            <text syncTime="5232.767" offset="20930978">One, the claim to these bays did not violate international law as it then existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.078" offset="20952294">Two, the waters of the bays are bounded by land of several of the states of the United States and therefore, by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5245.388" offset="20981551">Three, the bays did not lead from the sea to the dominions of any foreign nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.588" offset="21002344">Four, the process and interest to the United States and the respective States in this case Great Britain also claimed that bays are part of its territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.078" offset="21040274">Five, the States of the United States bordering the bays of exercised jurisdiction over the bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.801" offset="21063158">Six, the United States is exercised jurisdiction over the bays by creating revenue districts which clearly in compose the bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.106" offset="21096385">Now, let us turn to the California bays and apply these tests to the California bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.595" offset="21118328">First, in 1849 and 1950 acclaimed it all of bays along the California coast required that the California -- for the part of the territory of California was consistent with international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5292.472" offset="21169842">Two, these bays are bounded by the land of the State of California and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.107" offset="21192411">Three, the bays do not lead to the dominion of any foreign nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5302.071" offset="21208189">Four, California's predecessors in this case in Mexico, claimed the bays are part of their territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.092" offset="21236297">Five, the California is always claimed the bays and its constitution and exercise jurisdiction over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.343" offset="21261270">And finally and perhaps as importantly as any other point, the United States in 1849 created a revenue collection district which included and I quote, as it appears in our opening brief at page 58, “All of ports, harbors, bays, rivers, and waters in the mainland of the territory of Upper California which subsequently became a State of California.</text>

            <text syncTime="5339.637" offset="21358446">I think you'll see what I get prove my argument, its not circular and it's right to the point, if I may finish it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5346.173" offset="21384673">Now, we say that Chesapeake and Delaware Bays are inland waters then surely the Bays of California inland waters, irrespective of any presently used technical geographic criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="5357.742" offset="21430962">Now, as our State's Supreme Courts said in the Stralla case and discussing the criteria determining what are inland waters and I quote, the of 14 Cal.2d 631, “The usage and custom appears to be established to the effect that when, is here, the facts are that the bay is not and cannot become a pathway between nations that exclusive jurisdiction has been asserted under both the present and former governments that has been recognized as a bay and it's a harbor within the territorial boundaries of the states as described by the law of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="5391.843" offset="21567321">The Courts have decided in accordance with the jurisdictional claim.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5396.194" offset="21584771">California believes that the Government and the Special Master plays an unwarranted strictness and burden on California as to the quantum and burden on California as to the quantum and quality of proof required to established California's claims and particularly the bays as historic waters.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5410.632" offset="21642449">Recently, a great deal of study has been given to the Doctrine of Historic Waters as evidence by the decision of the International Court of Justice in the Anglo-Norwegian Fisheries case, the two UN monographs which are referred to on both our briefs and the Government's briefs and recent books on bays by International Law Scholars.</text>
            <text syncTime="5428.471" offset="21713816">As the International Court of Justice said in the Anglo-Norwegian played a case, historic waters should be defined as follows and I quote from the opinion of that case which appears on the reports of the International Court of Justice at page 116, “By historic waters are usually meant waters which are treated as internal waters but which would not have that character where it not for the existence of a historic title.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5453.835" offset="21815275">The beginning point of an analysis to this doctrine as we point it out -- as it was pointed out at the UN study, the recognition that the doctrine is an exception to other geographic criteria for delineating inland waters but it's a separate method of delineation of equal dignity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5470.701" offset="21882776">And this is extremely important, we say, to geographic criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="5475.472" offset="21901793">A necessary corollary to this view is the rejection of any requirement that prescriptive rights are titled by adverse possession must be established in order to qualify an area as historic waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5487.541" offset="21950067">The basic requirement is the peaceful exercise of authority without any foreign interference or objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5494.354" offset="21977339">Furthermore, the particular facts and circumstances of each area must be examined in order to ascertain whether that area constitutes historic waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5504.583" offset="22018299">In the case of California's bays, our briefs are set forth and detail a long recognition of the status of each bay from the Spanish period to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="5512.979" offset="22051840">We point out that our Constitution included all bays without exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="5517.639" offset="22070544">The three cases without hesitation rely on the Constitution as well as on the Spanish and Mexican history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5524.158" offset="22096562">These cases do not rely solely as was indicated by the Government on acts of jurisdictions such as fishing regulation but each delves into the history to recognize a pre-existing situation and recognition of a particular status of these bays in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="5540.203" offset="22160718">And now, we come to what I think is the probably the most important single point I would make with respect to the Government's intention in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5548.766" offset="22194991">And that is this, that each of these cases are three cases on bays has received worldwide publicity and recognition and continues to receive such recognition in the most recent literature and the subject to historic waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5562.924" offset="22251624">We have cited Commanders' Stroll's book and Mr. Buschey's book, but even more important than this and this we think is the key.</text>
            <text syncTime="5570.454" offset="22281718">Two of these cases, Ocean Industries and Carrillo were cited and digested in the State Department's Official Digest of International Law by Mr. Hackwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="5580.601" offset="22322364">This is noted in our closing brief at page 85, note 55.</text>
            <text syncTime="5586.365" offset="22345456">The next point is that in 1950, the State Department prepared a memorandum which is called the “United States Memorandum on the Regime of the High Seas”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.428" offset="22393626">This was annexed to a note, to the United Nations dated January 6, 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="5604.114" offset="22416405">It appears in the International Law of Commissions Yearbook for 1950, Volume II, at page 60; it is cited in our closing brief that pages 39 and 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="5613.706" offset="22454753">And this memorandum was published by the UN and later cited by Norway to the International Court on the Fisheries case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.228" offset="22484846">And the importance of this memorandum is that, in this memorandum prepared by the State Department, two of these cases which the Government is now objecting were cited in support of the position that these bays were in fact bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="5634.199" offset="22536777">So it's our position that in 1950, when the Government is now trying to argue here with a couple of letters which we say we're drafted up primarily for the purposes of this legislation for this argument of this case that these bays were not bays at the same time they were telling the United Nations with the purposes of the International Relations Policy that this bays are in fact bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="5652.993" offset="22611905">And I invite your examination to this memorandum which we have cited because we say, “It shows conclusively as of this time as to what the International Relation's position of the United States as to these bays really was, not what they say it is now.</text>

            <text syncTime="5730.254" offset="22920986">Now, what are these seven bays?</text>
            <text syncTime="5731.599" offset="22926315">They are Penobscot Bay, Long Island Sound, Delaware Bay, Chesapeake Bay, and the three California bays which we've cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="5740.133" offset="22960483">Another writer, Buschey who has written on this subject has cited two of our bays as historic bays among the few United States bays which he have cited as historic bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="5751.010" offset="23003951">We say that these California bays are not historic bays that it must be concluded that now that the areas mentioned are historic waters and that no such waters exist in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5761.271" offset="23045016">We believe this is not a tenable conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5766.921" offset="23067585">Now, the Government complained and I should mention these points of certain points about our evidences to the bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="5773.715" offset="23094857">The United States as the Acts must three of those United States and not California or on the other alternative that California's Acts are invalid if disclaimed by the Federal Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="5797.209" offset="23188793">More importantly, not only as the United States not disclaimed the California cases but as we had pointed out, it has affirmatively relied on that.</text>
