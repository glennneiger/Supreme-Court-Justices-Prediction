            <text syncTime="4.913" offset="19644">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.181" offset="28630">Yesterday, I tried to show how petitioner’s argument in this case was wrong in two respects, first of all, by giving to applicant’s readjustment under the 1946 statute, a higher basis for income tax purposes, then a purchaser would have had under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.000" offset="111909">Petitioner's argument ignores a direction of the statute to treat the vessel and the purchaser and the applicant for adjustment as if the vessel were being sold to the applicant on the date of the enactment of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.373" offset="165407">Second of all, I tried to show that petitioner's argument by giving it greater depreciation, then its economic investment on its own theory of economic investment would give it obviously too much depreciation and an unfair competitive advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.842" offset="231340">I said that today I would try to show how my close application of the provisions of the 1946 Act, you could and should reach the result for which the government contends, name it that the basis to an applicant for adjustment under the 1946 Act is the basis the applicant would have had as a purchaser under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.244" offset="324963">For that purpose, again, I shall have to refer to figures and again I shall try to restrict them to the figures on page 7 in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.471" offset="361848">Let me first go, recapitulate somewhat what Mr. McConnell did yesterday in giving some of the background of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.760" offset="398942">As Mr. McConnell said, the 18 vessels connected with this case were bought by the taxpayer between 1942 and 1946 for prices which were quite high reflecting war time cost of the vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.298" offset="469159">The prices paid appear on line one of the schedule on page 7, and that is about $47 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.001" offset="503954">The purchase price was paid for these ships in cash and also in mortgages and also in trade-ins of other ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.374" offset="537496">I don't think there's any need for us to worry further in the argument about the exact method of payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.235" offset="564872">And I think the taxpayer agrees that it doesn't matter in this case whether the payment was made by cash or trade-in or mortgage.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="163.274" stopTime="164.409">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="163.274" offset="653061">Now it's $2 million and 6, I see.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_bender" startTime="164.409" stopTime="675.188">
            <label>Mr. Paul Bender</label>
            <text syncTime="164.409" offset="657554">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.034" offset="660062">If you add those together you get the same figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.585" offset="674273">Now during the war, these ships were all charted back to the government under bareboat charters.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.164" offset="700604">The amount of charter hire received was about $13 million, that appears on line 4 of this chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.543" offset="734145">Also, as it came out yesterday, during the war while these boats were being charted to the United States, petitioner took depreciation on the vessels in computing its income taxes on this $13 million charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.592" offset="794331">The depreciation was about a $11 million, so you have up until the time of the petitioner buying the ships for $47 million, chartering them back to the government for about $13 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.601" offset="838322">Taking that $13 million into income for federal income tax purposes, meanwhile, depreciating the boats of federal income tax purposes by total of about $11 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.995" offset="879909">So at the time the Act is passed in March 1946, I think it's quite clear that the basis of the ships has been depreciated down from the original cost about $47 million by the amount of depreciation taken about $11 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.210" offset="952738">Now comes the 1946 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.185" offset="964650">Again, as Mr. McConnell described yesterday, the purpose of the Act in general was to sell all these ships which the government had acquired during the war to private parties at stable prices called the statutory sales price.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.468" offset="1021806">These prices were roughly in the case of cargo vessels which are involved in this case, about half what those vessels had cost people during the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.313" offset="1061198">Anyone could buy one, speaking in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.149" offset="1072588">Now, if that is all the Act have done, it would have been a bit unfair to people who had bought ships during the war at double the statutory prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.609" offset="1106338">So the Act contains a section, Section 9, which provided that persons who had bought vessels during the war could apply for an adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.885" offset="1147507">And the problem here is the effect of that adjustment which petitioner applied for and received upon petitioner's basis for income tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.458" offset="1181780">Let me try if I may to summarize for you, the nature of this Section 9 adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.969" offset="1211873">The provision to Section 9 seemed enormously complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.159" offset="1224620">There are eight subsections and then there's also subsection 9(b) and there is also Subsection C, but it's not as complicated as it seems on the face of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.607" offset="1262341">Essentially, there are three parts to the adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.843" offset="1279269">The overriding purpose of the whole thing is as I said before, to put the purchaser in the position he would have been at if he bought the ships under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.978" offset="1319811">Therefore, the first part of the adjustment which is contained in subsections 9(b) 1 through 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.354" offset="1353352">Those are on the pages 11a and 12a of the appendix to our brief and to some extent in 9(b) 7, provides that a credit shall be given to the applicant for the difference between the price he paid during the war and the statutory sales price, in this case that amount was $29,287,000, that's line 3 on page 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.590" offset="1454289">That gives him back the difference between the high price he paid in the statutory sales price.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.989" offset="1475918">But that alone, excuse me, I like to emphasize now that this -- for that chambers, for that credit in the statute, no income tax consequences are provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.276" offset="1525029">It simply provides that a credit shall be given for the difference in price.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.280" offset="1541120">No, that payment to the applicant is not a taxable payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.786" offset="1563063">That alone however, would not put the applicant in the position he would have been in had he bought the ship after the Act because he had used the ship during the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.761" offset="1606949">He had charted it to the government and received $13 million in charter hire and in fact he paid income taxes on that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.985" offset="1631922">So the second part of this adjustment is an unwinding of the transactions which the applicant actually entered into with the ship during the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.355" offset="1673404">Now that part is contained in subsections 9(b) 6 and to some extent in 9(b) 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.098" offset="1708304">What the Act provides is that all the charter hire, which the applicant received from the United States during the war should be returned to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.805" offset="1743203">Now in -- since the applicant had paid income taxes on that amount in return for that, those amounts are treated as if they had never been received in income and the applicant's income taxes are recomputed as though those amounts had never been received in income that's provided in 9(b) 8 by applying the provisions of 9(c) 1. 9(c) 1 is quite explicit on that amounts credited to the Secretary under the Section 9(b) 6, that is for charter hire, shall be treated for Federal Tax purposes as not having been received but accrued as income.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.500" offset="1897953">That alone however, still wouldn't have been enough because the applicant was taking depreciation deductions on these ships and if you just took the amount out of income, he would have these enormous deductions, $11 million, but no income to offset them.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.123" offset="1952392">So he either have -- it would either be offset of other income which he had for which he wouldn't be entitled to the deductions or he have a loss which he would carry over to other years.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.231" offset="1988859">So is it part of the total unwinding, we have to take away those depreciation deductions also and that's provided in 9(c) 1, depreciation amortization allowed or allowable for Federal Tax purposes shall be treated as not having been allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.915" offset="2047582">Well that's then the second part of the adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.116" offset="2056464">You give back the charter hire and you recompute the taxes as though the charter hire had never been received and as though depreciation deductions had not been allowable.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.476" offset="2093871">Now notice that there, Federal Tax consequences are very clearly provided in the Act for the giving back of charter hire, there is a corresponding lowering of federal income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.219" offset="2148833">You take that amount out of income and you re-compute the taxes as though that amount had never been paid as income, even though it had in fact been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.309" offset="2181224">Essentially, it amounts to a deduction from federal income taxes for the years in which the charter hire has been received.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.707" offset="2210795">Now, even those two things alone do not completely put the applicant in the position he would have been in, had he not bought the vessels until the date of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.750" offset="2246949">Because, if he hadn't bought the vessels, he wouldn't have traded in vessels, in this case the applicant traded in 4 vessels and those vessels, he would have charted to the government by trading them and he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.976" offset="2291879">Also in buying the vessels he made quite a substantial economic investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.049" offset="2308180">If he hadn't made that economic investment, he would have invested the money some place else or put it in the bank and receive some income on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.583" offset="2334302">So the third part of the adjustment which the Act provides, is to give him the income he would have received during the war if he hadn't purchased the ships until the date of the Act, and that's provided in 9(b) 5 and 9(b) 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.361" offset="2397414">One, we give him the charter hire which he would have received on the ships traded in.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.570" offset="2418207">Two, we gave him interest at the rate of 3.5% on the economic investment he made in the ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.352" offset="2449345">Again, corresponding to that payment to him which would have been ordinary income if it had been paid during the war, we impose federal income taxes on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.863" offset="2487380">Again, that's provided in 9(c) 1, amounts credited to the applicant under subsections (b) 5 and (b) 6 shall be treated for Federal Tax purposes as having been received and accrued as income in the taxable year which was on the date of the enactment of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.401" offset="2557597">So, these amounts are credited to him and income taxes are imposed upon the applicant in the year 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.442" offset="2593750">Those three things together, you give him back the difference in purchase price, you impose no tax consequences on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.986" offset="2619873">He gives you back the charter hire, you give them back the income taxes you paid on the receipt of the charter hire and we give him income he would have received if he hadn't purchased the ships an imposed taxes on that amount essentially, not completely, not exactly but essentially put the applicant in the position he would have been had he not purchased the ships until the date of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="750.822" offset="3003246">Right, right.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.442" offset="3013695">Now, the essence of our argument is that because of the tax consequences provided for the second and third parts of the adjustment I've described, that is the imposition of income tax on the charter hire an interest credited to the applicant and the forgiveness of income tax on the charter hire which the applicant pays back to the United States, because of these tax consequences, those parts of the adjustment have no effect upon basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.174" offset="3140650">Essentially, we argue that an amount paid by a buyer to a seller on which he takes a deduction from income, for Federal Tax purposes doesn't affect his basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.285" offset="3193104">On the other hand, an amount paid by a seller to a buyer which is taken into income by the applicant -- by the buyer doesn't affect his basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.269" offset="3229048">That means that the only part of this adjustment which affects basis is the purchase price credit, the $29 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.222" offset="3260813">And that is the amount of that credit diminishes basis from the original price which is $49 -- $47 million by the $29 million and you come out -- now this figures on page 8, if you make that subtraction, you come out with $17,800,000 which is the basis the applicant would have had if he bought the ship under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.474" offset="3345868">Now I'd like to try to demonstrate to you with some simple examples, not in the context of this rather complicated case why it is true that amounts which the buyer pays to the seller and which the buyer deducts from income do not affect his basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.631" offset="3418488">And on the other hand, amounts which the seller pays to the buyer which the buyer includes an income do not affect his basis leaving in this case only the amount of the purchase price adjustment which has no income tax consequences under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.725" offset="3470838">Take for an example, a very simple case.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.785" offset="3491109">I'll use figures of hundreds of dollars rather than millions of dollars but the figures are inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.081" offset="3512320">Suppose a buyer buys a building, a business building for a $100 and as part of the buying agreement, as part of the contract, he agrees to rent it back to the seller for one year for $10.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.866" offset="3575432">Now, the total amount the buyer then -- and the agreement also provides that the $10 rent shall be payable in advance at the time of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.167" offset="3612630">Now the total amount the buyer is going to pay in cash is $90, $100 for the building less $10 rent coming back.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.600" offset="3650351">However, I think it's quite clear that if the $10 rental payment is included in the buyer's income for income tax purposes, his basis in the building isn't $90, his basis is a $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.447" offset="3701760">Essentially, the basis is the amount he paid for the building, a $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.631" offset="3718478">The $10 payment which comes back, and which is set off against the $100 payment, doesn't affect his basis because it goes into his income.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.086" offset="3752333">And it has to be that way because if that went on for 10 years and his basis was only $90, he would have taken into income a total of a hundred dollars, $10 each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.853" offset="3799353">But only gotten depreciation deductions of $90 and that wouldn't be right since he didn't have any net -- he clearly didn't have any net gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.450" offset="3829760">So, I think that shows in a rather simple form, that an amount which the buyer takes into income which is offset against the amount he pays doesn't affect his basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.235" offset="3872914">On the other hand, an amount he pays which he deducts does not affect his basis, take same situation of buying a building and suppose that here the agreement obligates the buyer to invest $10 in advertising, his supposed part of a real estate development and he must invest $10 in addition to the hundred dollars in the first year in advertising the building or his services and suppose even then he has to pay the $10 to the seller who's an advertising agency, and suppose that the $10 is deductible from ordinary income, as I suppose it would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.019" offset="4011990">Again, he pays here a $110 but his basis isn't $110, his basis is only a hundred dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.650" offset="4038531">The only part of the payment which is capital is the $100, the $10 is deducted from ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.597" offset="4062354">The $10 doesn't go into the basis computation, that has to be true because if the $10 did go into the basis computation, he get a total of $120 deductions for only $110 outlay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.731" offset="4110838">The outlay is a 110, if he got a deduction which he did from ordinary incomes of paying $10 and if his basis was a 110, then he gets depreciation deductions of a 110 plus the 10 he has already got, and which would be a 120 for a total payment of a 110 which would be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.126" offset="4180428">So amounts which come in, which he takes into income don't affect basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.097" offset="4204356">Amounts which he pays, which he deducts from income don't affect basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.278" offset="4221074">Now those examples are quite close to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.443" offset="4237688">The only difference between those and this case is that in this case, you have those payments accompanying a purchase price adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.389" offset="4273528">But we can make the example just a little bit more complicated and put that in and then I think you'll have this precise case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.045" offset="4300173">Suppose again, he buys the building for a $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.469" offset="4313861">Suppose now that a year or so goes by and the seller says to him, “You paid too much for the building.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.743" offset="4346880">The seller wants to give him a refund because of some ongoing commercial relationship they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.814" offset="4367256">“I will give you back,” the seller says, “$50 of what you pay.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.380" offset="4389512">Now that were all if you just gave him back the $50, his basis would go down by $50, But suppose as a condition of giving back, first he says, “I'll give you back the $50 if you will rent the building to me for 10 years and the rental is payable -- I will pay you the rental at the time of the refund in advance -- rent the building for one year I suppose, $10 a year.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.275" offset="4489091">So how much does the seller pay the buyer back, $60, $50 is the purchase price adjustment, $10 is the advance rental payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.396" offset="4529528">But the basis of the buyer is reduced not by $60, only by $50 if that $10 rental payment is taken into income just as in the past example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.575" offset="4570279">Now that's just like the part of this case which involves the re -- the substituted charter hire and 3.5% interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.512" offset="4606015">That's just what happening in that part of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.702" offset="4618762">The government is giving back the purchase price adjustment, difference between the price originally paid and the statutory sales price and it's also paying to the buyer some income namely, substituted charter hire and the ships traded-in and 3.5% interest which by the very terms of the statute is taken into income for income tax purposes in the year 1946 and he couldn't' provide that any clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.069" offset="4724193">Now, if that were all they were in the statute, just the purchase price adjustment and the return of -- and the payment of substituted charter hire, the basis would be lowered not by the whole amount in this case the $29 million plus the $2,600,000 on line 7, which -- and the $1 million on line 6 which is the substituted charter hire and interest, those amounts wouldn't reduce the basis because those amounts had taken into income for income tax purposes by the taxpayer, the basis would be reduced only by the $20 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.978" offset="4863896">That's half of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.608" offset="4870374">Therefore, we submit that those amounts in line 6 and 7 substituted charter hire and a 3.5% interest do not affect the basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.839" offset="4907259">The other half of this case is like the following example, which is like when I gave before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.625" offset="4930456">You have the same building, same hundred dollars, the same two-year later seller who decides that he has paid too much and wants to give him back $50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.805" offset="4959190">But this time as part of the agreement, that he'll only give him back the $50 if the buyer will agree to invest -- let's say $10 in advertising which he has to pay to the seller who is an advertising agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.991" offset="5019899">And let's suppose that it's true that that $10 is deductible from ordinary income by the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.774" offset="5043096">Now if that's all you have, what's -- the net payment is 50 minus 10, so it's only 40, but the basis isn't reduced by 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.647" offset="5078518">The basis is reduced by 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.457" offset="5085727">The basis is reduced by the part of the payment which represents the return of capital by the difference between original price and the new price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.283" offset="5117074">The $10 payment for advertising which is deductible from ordinary income, doesn't affect the basis for the reason I gave before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.531" offset="5146122">If it did, you deduct that amount twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.870" offset="5159393">That's just like the part of this case which involves the payment of charter hire by the applicant back to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.771" offset="5195024">That payment is a condition of receiving the adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.021" offset="5212056">The adjustment comes to him, he must pay the charter hire back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.877" offset="5231491">For the payment of the adjustment to the applicant, there are no income tax consequences imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.409" offset="5253538">But, for the payment of the charter hire back to the government, there are income tax consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.347" offset="5277362">Essentially, that amount is taken out of the applicant's income for the years when it was received.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.201" offset="5300767">It amounts to precisely a deduction from ordinary income for that amount of $13 million, it's a deductible payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.080" offset="5332219">Well, a deductible payment is I think I have demonstrated before, does not affect the basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.725" offset="5350818">Therefore, that amount of charter hire which is paid back to the government under Section 9(b) 6 of the Act, on which federal income taxes are forgiven because of the effect of 9(c) 1 of the Act, doesn't affect the basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.655" offset="5418527">So the basis you come out with here, is simply the amount of the purchase price adjustment which is paid back the first part of the adjustment I described, which doesn't affect -- which doesn't have any federal income tax consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.374" offset="5473489">The only -- it seems to me that the only ground on which you can dispute that analysis is by saying, as petitioner does say, that in fact federal income tax consequences are not imposed upon these payments in parts two and three of the adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.124" offset="5544438">He says, “Federal income tax consequences are not imposed on the payment of substituted charter hire income, not imposed on the payment of the 3.5% interest and on the other hand, deductions are not given for the payment of charter hire back to the government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.029" offset="5600026">Now if that were true, petitioner would be right, but it just isn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.805" offset="5615177">And it isn't so because the Act provide as clearly as it could possibly provide the federal income tax consequences are imposed on those payments, and that as I say is provided in 9(b) 8 and 9(c) 1. 9(c) compels an applicant for adjustment as a means of getting the adjustment to sign an agreement, binding upon the Act in any affiliated interest and the agreement is in three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.577" offset="5718204">One, he's got to agree that depreciation and amortization already taken shall not be treated as allowable for Federal Tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.794" offset="5751118">Two, amounts credit to the Secretary that charter hire he pays shall be treated for federal income tax purposes as not having been received, that is, he gets a deduction for them in the re-computation of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.911" offset="5799602">Three, amounts he gets on the 95 and 6, the substituted charter hire interest payments are treated as income for federal income tax purposes in the taxable year of the enactment of the Act, 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.979" offset="5847876">Then after he signs that agreement, Section 9(b) 8 provides that, they shall be subtracted from the credits in favor of the Secretary the amount of any over payments of Federal Taxes of the applicant resulting from that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.349" offset="5901375">And I don't see how that could be any clear that if he has overpaid taxes because he paid taxes on the charter hire which you shouldn't pay and he gets the taxes back, those amounts shall be treated as credits and also any deficiencies in the next sentence shall be treated as credits and their deficiencies in Federal income tax of -- deficiencies in Federal income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.190" offset="5996669">Then when you come to the end of Subsection 9(b) 8, provides that upon such payment by the Secretary, such overpayment shall be treated as having been refunded and such deficiencies as having been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.475" offset="6041809">Again, it clearly emphasizes that the effect of this statute is to re-compute the income taxes and to treat any deficiencies or over payments resulting from the re-computation as paid, satisfied, obligation finished, taxes have been recomputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.538" offset="6110145">Well, if – as I tried to show, if you re-compute the taxes in that manner, the only part of this adjustment which can possibly affect basis is the part of this adjustment upon which no Federal Taxes are imposed and that is the difference to credit in Subsections 9(b) 1 through Subsection 9(b) 4, the credit for the difference between the price actually paid by the applicant and the statutory price.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.850" offset="7407386">I have a very short time remaining here that I would like to answer some of the questions that were raised and I think if we're coming back now to the point at which this should have begun and on which it shall be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.341" offset="7469349">And that is, Mr. Justice White's question of how much did this taxpayer pay for these vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.478" offset="7497874">Now Mr. Bender says, we didn't pay $26 million, but it's stipulated, it's in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.664" offset="7522638">It's clear we paid $16 million before any adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.254" offset="7540924">It is clear that after the adjustment, we owed $10 million more dollars which we have paid, making a total of $26 million which regardless of how it was computed is the purchase price of these 18 vessels and therefore, the economic investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.499" offset="7613962">Now, there have been several questions asked about the purpose of this of getting back statutory sales price, Mr. Chief Justice asked this yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.901" offset="7647504">If you'll look at the comparison of the bills that we have in our Appendix C, showing the bills considered and rejected and the bill adopted, you will see that one of the bills said, “Reduce it down to the statutory sales price,” that's not the bill adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.787" offset="7719079">That's the computation you would get from Schedule 1 on page 7 if that bill had been adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.042" offset="7744157">However, it was recognized everywhere that the adjustment would not be made down to the statutory sales price and if it was not made to the statutory sales price, therefore, any taxpayer who purchased before and whose price were adjusted would pay more than the statutory sales price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.418" offset="7817613">We paid $26 million which is more than statutory sales price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.758" offset="7834958">So you do not get it down to the statutory sales price and we submit that Section 9 (b), the application of formula, will not produce this table, Schedule 1 on page 7 nor the results contain therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.127" offset="7892428">And it is true that if you look at this, you will see that the government admits a net payment, and in fact there was no payment, all of this is misleading.</text>
