            <text syncTime="31.575" offset="126224">Mr. Fleischmann.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arnold_fleischmann" startTime="33.208" stopTime="876.132">
            <label>Mr. Arnold Fleischmann</label>
            <text syncTime="33.208" offset="132807">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.903" offset="159556">This is a case of a tying arrangement within the context of a franchise system.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.452" offset="189753">Carvel, the respondents are the franchise source of a chain of soft ice cream stores, roadside stores, stores which serve the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.237" offset="244924">They have licensed approximately 400 such stores, approximately 250 of which are located in the area about which we're primarily concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.297" offset="297169">These stores are of interest to the independent businessman, the independent businessman who wants to be his own boss, who wants to be on his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.290" offset="349100">When Carvel went into the franchising business, is -- it undertook a very strong campaign to publicize the values and qualities of its franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.496" offset="401972">These values were constantly repeated in daily newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.962" offset="423811">They appeared in television and we have a very brief outline of them on page 7 of our reply brief -- oh, page 6 on the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.970" offset="471876">These items are the ones which we consider to be the essential ones to the value of the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.045" offset="512104">They are -- and this is what the independent businessman who wants to become a Carvel franchisee since they are the expert guidance which the franchisor can furnish.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.137" offset="572500">They are the good location and they are the recipes and the techniques that make for success.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.945" offset="603742">As a matter of fact, Carvel has very well publicized that and -- one of the exhibits introduced in this case by Carvel specifically refers to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.038" offset="652121">It is on page 427 in the lower left-hand corner, where Carvel describes the merits of its soft ice cream chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.964" offset="695798">It's a very small print.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.847" offset="703321">Now, this is the value of this chain, the businessman has the amicus curiae put it -- get a running start if he becomes a part of a franchise organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.121" offset="772389">This is what these individuals who were looking forward to becoming successful businessmen sought when they became franchise operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.726" offset="818887">Now, unlike some of the franchises which are occurring in this country, Carvel has envisioned the right to operate the soft ice cream stores which it wants to franchise to the individual operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.264" offset="901016">And the expert guidance which the applicant for a franchise seeks, not only on the payment of a royalty which is the usual and customary way but also on an agreement to purchase almost all of its commissary goods and supplies and equipment which the dealer needs in this everyday operation of his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.815" offset="1007177">Thus, the applicant has no choice if he wants a Carvel franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.956" offset="1027762">He must buy frantically all of his commissary goods from Carvel.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.696" offset="1058691">Now, if we look at this problem in a broad sense, we see that there is a tying arrangement between the item which is desirable, unique and attractive to the applicant, the things that make for business success.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.556" offset="1150224">And which are perhaps accompanied by certain things like the Carvel name and reputation, by Carvel's way of doing business and even perhaps by the appearance of the Carvel stores in the way they have uniqueness in their qualities.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.361" offset="1221381">Now, these are the items which draw the franchiser -- franchisee to Carvel.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.177" offset="1252624">And this is the element.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.026" offset="1264013">This is the focus of the tying arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.567" offset="1278224">This interpretation of the tying arrangement does not differ very substantially from the position taken by Chief Justice Lumbard in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.444" offset="1329737">It is almost the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.433" offset="1337678">But, I think the emphasis is placed somewhat differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.698" offset="1354710">It is also essentially the same view which was taken in a similar case, not part of this proceeding by the Federal Trade Commission examiner who heard evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.724" offset="1402880">In both cases and the Court and the Federal Trade Commission found a tying arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.746" offset="1434958">And Judge Lumbard in his opinion found an illegal tying arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.146" offset="1456483">The concurrent -- the majority opinion of Judges Friendly and Medina is actually in agreement on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.727" offset="1502877">I think the Court as an entirety finds a tying arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.326" offset="1517296">The only difference on which the result comes out, the only way the result differs is that the majority refers to the fact that Carvel plaintiffs, the plaintiffs in the case below, the petitioners here, entered into a stipulation by which they agreed to limit themselves to the per se violations of the antitrust laws as far as proof was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.956" offset="1647804">As a matter of fact, it actually wasn't as far as proof was concerned they said that they were going to rely on the per se violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.340" offset="1677270">It was evidently their position that this Court's opinions and laws and also in Northern Pacific made it very clear that this was one of the most pernicious forms of tying arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.220" offset="1740800">This kind of tying arrangement that -- which we speak here, Your Honor, is not the kind of tying arrangement which means a purchase of an initial inventory tied to a certain values in the purchase of franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.299" offset="1817182">This is not what we're referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.191" offset="1824705">This is a tying arrangement for the commissary goods for the life of the franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.518" offset="1854067">In doing this, in tying this, the commissary goods to the franchise, for the entire life of the franchise, not only is the competitive supplier excluded from the market of 400 Carvel dealers, who according to stipulated figures, buy approximately four and half million dollars worth of goods substantially more than were involved in the International Salt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.967" offset="1999830">And we feel that a substantial market is as to the result tied and controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.014" offset="2039954">From this, I think it can be concluded that there is tremendous value in the tying item.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.453" offset="2081750">And the tying item as Judge Lumbard put it, consists not only of the items which I feel attract the ordinary businessman who knows nothing about patents and copyrights and trademarks and machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.404" offset="2145593">He only knows about this is an advertised -- this makes for success 21 years without a business failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.896" offset="2183523">We have served the soft ice cream industry since 1934 succeed with Carvel.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.531" offset="2230021">And it's almost an underwritten promise that this franchise will give success.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.790" offset="2259069">This is an attitude which I think overwhelms an applicant and makes it easy for him to acquiesce in this type of arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.777" offset="2307030">And in an acquiescing in this kind of arrangement, he not only puts himself in the position of agreeing to purchase these commissary goods for the period of his business experience with Carvel.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.090" offset="2368261">But, he also puts himself in the position where he must, if he ever violates the law -- the rules set forth in the franchise agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.622" offset="2414446">If he ever violates by buying from a competitor, a national biscuit company and other large companies have very anxiously solicited the business of this Carvel dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.786" offset="2467109">If he ever violates this rule, he is in a position where he may be forced to give up his business with a loss of a substantial part of his investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.276" offset="2517055">In fact, most of his investment, depending on what the year is in which this franchise is terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.261" offset="2552999">And as a result of that, he is not only restricted in his freedom to compete in the marketplace for -- with -- he is not only restricted in obtaining price concessions from suppliers, he is completely eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.125" offset="2640457">He is completely made a part of the Carvel organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.755" offset="2662922">True and this is Judge -- what Judge Lumbard recognizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.224" offset="2676820">There is price competition on the sup -- on the Carvel level.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.700" offset="2694792">Carvel gets the price concessions but if the Carvel dealer had available to him the opportunity of dealing with more than one supplier, there would be no problem because he too would get price concessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.352" offset="2761352">Now, if he violates this part of the franchise agreement and his agreement is terminated, or if his franchise is not renewed, he'd not only exclude it from the business area for a short period of time, he's excluded from an area of 25 miles for a period of five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.530" offset="2850064">This is a very, very severe restriction and one which I think will cause an owner of a franchise to think twice before he will violate the franchise terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.570" offset="2910250">Now in discussing the aspects of what happens to the suppliers, we have not only to take into consideration the suppliers which supply Carvel.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.359" offset="2981407">But, other suppliers would do equally well and will do equally well in supplying the needs of Carvel dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.243" offset="3016934">It should be noted that Eagle Cone Corporation which does business in the State of Pennsylvania is not permitted to sell to Carvel dealers the very same cones which it can sell to Connecticut dealers, which it can sell to Massachusetts dealers, because in Pennsylvania this is the area of the Illinois Baking Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.091" offset="3124349">Now, for a practical -- in a practical sense, I -- the supplier actually deals with the dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.808" offset="3171161">It's only in the form in which the agreement is cast that Carvel is the supplier at all, that dealer gives his order to the supplier and I note that there are different suppliers with different things, different suppliers with dairy product, different suppliers for ice cream cones.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.878" offset="3255484">He gets his order to these suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.670" offset="3266664">The suppliers deliver them to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.753" offset="3278994">They invoice him on a bill which was prepared and printed at the request of Carvel on a Carvel letterhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.282" offset="3313058">And that even in most instances collect payments from the dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.100" offset="3336359">In other words, the dealers are in effect dealing with the supplier without having the benefits which come with price competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.116" offset="3392366">They were permitted to deal with the other suppliers who could very easily and are capable of furnishing these very same supplies as indicated by the fact that Carvel doesn't just deal with Rakestraw and Hood, it deals with a number of other dairies in the large area.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.585" offset="3482331">It doesn't just deal with Eagle Cone.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.356" offset="3489332">It deals with other suppliers of cones in other areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1668.601" offset="6674390">Well, Your Honor, on this point and this is a point in which the Court of Appeals did not agree with the position of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.251" offset="6740950">On this particular point the Carvel dealer is advised informally through recommendations of the supervisors and through the Board of Governors of the Dealers Association, what is proper and what is improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.667" offset="6818586">And the price fixing angle is one of moral suasion which is contradicted by self serving decorations of Carvel in the record to which Carvel will tell you that you are not required to follow our recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.791" offset="6899148">In fact, I think there is a cushion of the testimony of one of the petitioners in this case, Modick (ph) in the record, who in the presence of a supervisor build a huge ice cream cone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.783" offset="6959125">And Carvel defendants try to point out, well, if this is possible, you can violate these rules, then isn't it true that you are not required to follow these recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.277" offset="7025058">And the dealer answered at that point and now I'm paraphrasing with the (Inaudible) but the -- he says, ?Well, I was very severely censored and criticize for what I did.?</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.028" offset="7080020">And this is essentially the type of arrangement that exist in that regard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1870.075" offset="7480216">This is why the trade mark is part of the focus of the tying arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.212" offset="7504771">But on the other hand I would say the machinery is an insignificant one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.932" offset="7519713">They are equally good ones but not superior ones on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.746" offset="7534968">And the -- well, not for the fact that you couldn't get a franchise without buying the machinery, I think there'd be many dealers who would be very happy to buy the equipment elsewhere but they could not get this franchise except as part of this package.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.052" offset="7620127">And continuing this point which Your Honor just made, I think it follows that these unique qualities as they were called in the lowest case and these unique qualities as they were called-in in Northern Pacific are the things which exert the market power which bring about the dominance of the tying item.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.455" offset="7741753">This is why we take the position that this unlike any of the other cases that might have been considered under Loew's and Northern Pacific goes much further than the tying arrangements considered in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.368" offset="7825450">It's much more pernicious because here isn't a problem of extraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.778" offset="7847079">You can't -- you -- no dealer who has once signed this franchise agreement can just drop the franchise name can't just say, ?Take away your cargo -- trade name, I want to be an independent dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.108" offset="7900369">I don't want to buy from you anymore.?</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.219" offset="7908833">They can't say that because in order to terminate your relationship with Carvel you've got to give up your store and you've got to go out of business for five years and out for an area of 25 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.327" offset="7965257">You cannot continue in the soft ice cream business if you surrender your Carvel franchise and that's an addition to the economic losses with yourself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.846" offset="8003291">This is why I think if you take away the trademark question and I recalled that Judge Lumbard in his opinion put it very well, the issue in a threshold question he says is, ?Whether the Carvel franchise embodies the tying agreement and whether that arrangement is justified.?</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.242" offset="8096914">And the only justification in which he seems to recognize as a possibilitylooking at the exception in the White Motor case referring to standard stations is the possibility that Carvel might give specifications to other supplies and it's for that reason that he suggests that the case be remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.502" offset="8213943">It is our view and in that regard, perhaps I'm very bold because I disagree with the judge who was most closely to our position below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.592" offset="8266292">It is our view that this is a per se violation and that it is one in the most pernicious sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.422" offset="8301610">This -- if we take away the trademark is Northern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.967" offset="8327837">You take the lease of this store, assume all the know-how in the tying arrangement, assume that expert guidance, assume perhaps even the individuality of the store but not the trademark, you have a very, very simple case of leasing a store with a tying of the commissary goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.566" offset="8446224">And it's exactly the same way except for one thing, in Northern Pacific the lessee had an opportunity of dealing with the competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.292" offset="8493140">In Carvel's franchise he does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.255" offset="8508918">In Carvel's franchise he is completely tied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.579" offset="8526263">In Northern Pacific, if a competitor came along and said ?I offer you a better rate,? the lessor had agreed that the lessee might use this other carrier who will ship this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.194" offset="8600764">So even though the market was substantially closed, it wasn't completely closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.619" offset="8622393">Here, the market is completely closed and this is why this case is of such importance not only to the petitioners here but to the franchise industry as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.217" offset="8680803">Franchising has become a very, very important part of this nation's economy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2940.402" offset="11761580">And the soul reason why Carvel objects to letting the dealer sell Coke -- Coca-Cola, Pepsi Cola, any of these national trade marks, because they know that in permitting them to do that, they're depriving themselves of potential profit in the tied items.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.482" offset="11845904">If a man comes in and buys a Coca-Cola instead of a Carvel ice cream shake, then Carvel will not get any royalty on that Coca-Cola and it has no real reason for tying that Coca-Cola into its franchise arrangement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3024.821" offset="12099187">When Carvel decided that it wanted to install Carvel Cola and Carvel Root Beer, they made the dealer buy the equipment form Carvel, they made them sign a supplement to the franchise and they made them pay a royalty on the use of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.394" offset="12181525">And since they supply the syrup, they made a profit on it and basically Carvel Root Beer is Richardson's Root Beer and there isn't any differences between Richardson's Root Beer and Carvel Root Beer and yet Richardson cannot sell root beer to Carvel stores and it could not before the arrangement was made.</text>

            <text syncTime="3364.121" offset="13456405">Well, Your Honor, I believe that Judge Lumbard specifically says that there is a per se violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.328" offset="13481273">The only argument which he leaves open is the argument which respondents make that there is a little opening left as a result of the Standard Stations case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.302" offset="13525159">And this little opening says that if in order to safeguard the trade name, the reputation of the name, it is necessary to tie then if it is impossible to furnish specifications but it's impractical to furnish specifications then under those circumstances it is possible that it might be justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.069" offset="13644173">But this Court except for the dicta in the Standard Stations case has never held a per -- held that a per se violation, a tying arrangement could be justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.260" offset="13704986">I think that the best that we can say is that there are some circumstances in beginning industry like in the Jerrold's case or in situation of that kind that there maybe the possibility for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.851" offset="13775308">But here, we have a situation which by the very fact that Carvel was able to supply specifications to Rakestraw and to Eagle and to Hood, and to Illinois Baking Company, and as a matter of fact the cones are standard items in the market, they're not specifically Carvel cones even though Carvel like to call them that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.958" offset="13887739">These items can be specified, all these items can be specified and if there are special secret formulas involved the proposed supplier who is interested by National Biscuit Company which requested the right to supply Carvel dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.445" offset="13957747">And which was faced with a letter (Inaudible) with litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.424" offset="13977600">If these suppliers wanted to serve Carvel, they can ask for the specification and then be permitted to deal with the dealers directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.849" offset="14023367">And if there is any supervision on the part of Carvel involved and perhaps there is, slightly greater problem of supervision then this problem of supervision I think can be readily resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.525" offset="14078015">There are many reputable manufacturers in the field and this is why we feel that the supplier defendants a part of this case Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.748" offset="14106958">Carvel is not manufacturing its own right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.326" offset="14117303">Without the defendants, without the supplier defendants there would be no tying arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.901" offset="14143530">Their agreements with the supplier defendants are -- were made knowing that the suppliers would supply this market of 400 dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.226" offset="14184803">And they were made by the suppliers in order to make it possible for Carvel to enforce its conduit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.865" offset="14227435">It may -- it may be that they claim no knowledge of these things but I think the affidavit of Mr. Kane who speaks of the fierce competition of cone industry and the uniqueness of the stable market that exist by reason of Carvel's agreement with Eagle Cone is a clear indication of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.222" offset="14304862">I think it's on page 115 of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="4841.654" offset="19366557">I -- oh, the example I gave is that if you start with a trademark, let's say some company car, Company X.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.198" offset="19408771">And you franchise a dealer and you generate a presumption as Judge Lumbard, Chief Judge Lumbard indicates that the mere existence of the trademark shows sufficient economic power to exert leverage to control competition or affect competition of the tied product and the tied product is the very thing for which the trademark exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.219" offset="19512842">As is the case of mix which is the essential product then you've got every single trademark product in a situation of being an unlawful tying agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.783" offset="19563102">Now of course, I don't think that the -- that it's appropriate or necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.555" offset="19586194">In this case, I don't understand why Chief Judge Lumbard ever reached the question of whether you need to generate a presumption from the existence of the Carvel trademark because even he agreed as that the across the majority in the District Court that there was no evidence of injury to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.484" offset="19685878">Indeed, the majority's finding is that there was not even an insubstantial amount of commerce involved which is the less stringent standard under the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.516" offset="19746064">And this was remar -- this is reminiscent of course of the reminder in the Tampa decision of this Court that where the evidence isn't sufficient to live up to the -- to fulfill the less stringent standard it's certainly won't live up to the more stringent one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.944" offset="19823700">So that -- in view of the shape of this record, it doesn't make any difference whether one presumes since there's an admitted actions of proof of economic power or whether one doesn't because the second condition is not present namely evidence of injury to competition and said the Court by majority not even by the less stringent rule of an insubstantial amount of commerce being involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4989.409" offset="19957551">Now, what strikes me is very peculiar and this has been bugging me throughout the proceeding, is the lack of live witnesses.May it please the Court, a tying arrangement to something that restricts, something that you feel and if the pinh of a tying arrangement were really in the marketplace, these people couldn't keep their clients off the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5027.019" offset="20108016">Nobody appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5029.114" offset="20116376">The one fellow who appealed gave testimony about a joke he played.</text>
            <text syncTime="5034.378" offset="20137482">He made a -- I don't know how expensive, a very expensive ice cream cone and he admitted it's stood a foot high and begun of course immediately to melt and he was -- he happened to do it when a supervisor came in and he got a lecture about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.014" offset="20192026">Now, that's the only man that took the stand and the only evidence we have and it's my impression that with the absence of any proof from clients or generally readily available to testify that this complaint about tying is a complaint born in a law library and not in any felt restrictions in the marketplace</text>
            <text syncTime="5075.745" offset="20302890">And the lower court coming to this stipulation, the late Judge Dawson said as we cited in our brief, he had occasion to say, ?During the trial you can bring any witnesses you want, nobody restricted these people from trying a case in a normal way to indicate what their complaint was.?</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.270" offset="20381048">As a matter of fact, the pleadings as we point out on pages 7 to 9 of our brief indicate that they didn't dream about even premising a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="5106.862" offset="20427442">In the nine complaints drawn between 1900 and 1959 in the fall and the spring of 1960, there is nothing about tying in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.559" offset="20462132">There is something that sounds as Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out, a complaint that a total requirement agreement involves refraining without compelling the dealers to refrain from buying the products of other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.743" offset="20542903">I'd like to say a word about the argument that the new counsel, I don't think he'll deny that most of the answers he gave is based on a record that's not the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.735" offset="20602880">I'm in both cases, so I know.</text>
            <text syncTime="5156.366" offset="20625450">And I thought that Mr. Rothstein, the former counsel had drawn the limit in referring to the initial decision of a trial examiner on other cases a reason for granting certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="5170.861" offset="20683442">I mean he treated as it is though it was almost the equivalent of a split between the circuits about which I -- you know, we said nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5180.869" offset="20723461">But now, it's another matter to introduce it here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herman L. Weisman</label>
            <text syncTime="5185.579" offset="20742269">The other cases were started after Judge Dawson's decision and it's a Section 5 case and it's now pending on appeal from the initial decisions by -- it's an all together different record and as we point out and I shall -- a very short reply brief, the examiner himself said that he acknowledges the existence of the Second Circuit decision but the record is so different that he feels the extended discussion is unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.122" offset="20856477">He just not -- they're following it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5216.278" offset="20865045">And he found the tying element to be the franchise agreement not the use of the copyright.</text>
            <text syncTime="5224.736" offset="20898900">So I would respectfully suggest that since the trial examiner was courteous enough to ignore the persuasive cause of the circuit proposition, he might -- his decision here might be a court of the same courtesy namely to ignore it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5248.787" offset="20995135">Now, the trademark is one area which indicates a certain amount of permissive conduct on the part of the owner to make sure he controls his quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.458" offset="21069740">This is infused with the existence which cannot be against that of the secret processes, the trade processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.746" offset="21118955">Now, there is no monopoly given by the trademark law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5286.874" offset="21147481">The trademark law is merely a signature, it's a method of identifying the product so that the public wouldn't be fooled as to their source and it's obvious that they can attach as Mr. Justice Black having been made point out to the end product but they could readily -- it doesn't happened to be the case here, that's why I answered the question that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5313.376" offset="21253433">You could have a trademark which attaches to some components, all components as well as the end product or to everything down the line including the wrapping paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="5325.701" offset="21302753">But therefore to presume that this -- the use of a trademark indicates sufficient economic power to exert unlawful leverage seems to me entirely inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5342.910" offset="21371611">Now the solution is something that needs a word.</text>
            <text syncTime="5352.101" offset="21408392">Mr. Justice Harlan suggested that Chief Judge Lumbard thought it ought to go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="5358.063" offset="21432216">Well that's true, except he said it ought to go back for the limited purpose of giving testimony on the part of Carvel eliiting testimony which didn't satisfy him on this record, that's the dissent that there was enough justification for Carvel to impose these restrictions on the component parts, on the purchase of the component parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5388.017" offset="21552065">And he said that the per se stipulation condition the -- perhaps the falsity of the evidence and that the courts relied on evidence in his estimation very meager to the effect that the publication of specifications for these ingredients in order to make sure that Carvel's ideas would be carried out in his end product that the publication of such specifications would be unduly burdensome.</text>
            <text syncTime="5422.493" offset="21689887">He said if Carvel is able to submit more proof than it had on that point, then the result would be the same, meaning that he would be in accord with the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5433.401" offset="21733564">Now, our friends are not satisfied with sending the case back for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.680" offset="21754671">They say as a matter of law that Carvel is compelled -- would be compelled to publish all these specifications including those covering his trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5453.971" offset="21815798">And I have seen nothing in the law that would lead to such a -- (Inaudible) lead to such a conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="5482.096" offset="21928333">Right now, Carvel gets a batch report on each batch together with the chemical analysis and has the right of inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.177" offset="21960620">It con -- it preconditions the way it's packaged, the amount of packaging so that the man when he gets to stop in a store, won't put in too much and get that quantity or put too little in and cheat the public or get their quality and dissatisfy the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="5508.755" offset="22035017">Well, how was he -- how are you going to police it with hundreds of dairies making these prods -- making these products?</text>
            <text syncTime="5515.909" offset="22063543">How are you going to police 400 stores in the -- and the majority opinion says agrees with the lower court and says there's no reason for disturbing the finding that it would be an undue burden and an unfeasible cost, and uneconomic thing to require Carvel to attempt to exercise this supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.578" offset="22154240">Meanwhile, the value of the secret formula is gone because you can keep a secret maybe when you have four or five contracts with selected dairies but you can't keep a secret when hundreds of them are bidding and there's nothing wrong, the Court was unanimous about the drop shipping part of the transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="5836.611" offset="23346364">Now you can't compare a formula which is used by the dealers to build up a substantial business on hard and soft ice cream items with soft ice cream.</text>
            <text syncTime="5845.892" offset="23383562">If you compare it with ice cream, you get -- not the fantastic percentages he's talking about but you got a range in Massachusetts for the year he picked out in 1959 of less than one-fifth of 1% to a high in New Jersey of 3.3%, the next figure being New York at 2.89%.</text>
            <text syncTime="5868.251" offset="23472901">And the figure in the New York market is 1% based on the exhibits in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5875.664" offset="23502576">And the initial decision said that even if it were 4% for New York and Nassau County, it would still be illegal quoting some case that doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5887.662" offset="23550642">And then saying even though the areas entirely intrastate, it could be a sign of an incipient growth or injury to the interstate commerce and therefore he thinks the 4% even though it's limited to one intrastate area was enough under Section 5 but that's another story and it will be soon decided I hope by the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="6519.015" offset="26076056">Carvel also furnishes to Hood what are called the stabilizer and the emulsifier used in the making of this mix.</text>
            <text syncTime="6531.981" offset="26127882">Now it is significant that the petitioners in their brief had made no mention of the fact so far as I could discern that the ice cream mix under Carvel's special is made under the special secret formula of Carvel that Carvel furnishes to Hood the stabilizer and emulsifier and that systematically Carvel inspects Hood's plant to ensure the high-quality and (Inaudible) -- sanitary quality of the entire manufacturing operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="6798.209" offset="27192738">It was originated by Carvel and it's only in imitable ways and delivered to Hood and Hood makes that by the -- with the addition of two ingredients namely the stabilizer and the emulsifier supplied directly by Carvel.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_a_wilson" startTime="6821.567" stopTime="7259.113">
            <label>Mr. John A. Wilson</label>
            <text syncTime="6821.567" offset="27286256">No, we do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6823.436" offset="27293675">Now, this mix as I've indicated is a perishable product.</text>
            <text syncTime="6829.606" offset="27318335">It is therefore delivered by Hood on instructions of Carvel directly to certain Carvel retail ice cream stores, these roadside stores that we see.</text>
            <text syncTime="6842.629" offset="27370475">Stores located so far as Hood is concerned only in the States of Massachusetts and Connecticut, that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6851.449" offset="27405793">Now, this direct delivery is necessary to avoid warehousing with consequent delay which would lead to the deterioration of the product with possible damage, I think almost certain damage to the public health.</text>
            <text syncTime="6869.232" offset="27476846">Now, may I say in passing that the Court should not draw the erroneous conclusion that Hood does a considerable volume of business with Carvel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6886.312" offset="27545182">The Court might possibly do so from the statement which appears in the petitioner's brief that Carvel has about 400 franchise stores and delivers and has these stores in 9 or 10 states and that Carvel so the petitioners state in their brief sells to store operators more than two million gallons of mix annually.</text>
            <text syncTime="6912.504" offset="27649985">For the total business (Inaudible) which Hood actually does with Carvel is in fact very small.</text>
            <text syncTime="6920.851" offset="27683318">Hood delivers not to 400 retail stores in 9 or 10 states but only to stores in the two states of Massachusetts and Connecticut and to an average of about approximately 32 stores per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="6936.922" offset="27747683">And Hood deliver -- the -- now, I would like to make this very clear that the sole issue pertaining to Hood is whether these supply contracts under which it supplies the mix, whether these supply contracts, evidence, practices or agreements which constitute per se violations of antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="6964.552" offset="27858129">I think it must be clearly understood that the petitioners here concede that there is no combination between the supplier defendants and between the supplier defendants in Carvel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6979.112" offset="27916434">That is there is no sort of conspiratorial round robin in which all participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6986.684" offset="27946736">They admit that they charge only that Carvel is violating the antitrust laws by a series of agreements going out from Carvel separately like the spokes of a wheel to each of the supplier defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="7006.583" offset="28026253">Now, very briely what do these Carvel supply contracts -- Carvel-Hood supply contracts provide?</text>
            <text syncTime="7015.509" offset="28061989">Hood agrees to manufacture and sell to Carvel all the Carvel mix required by Carvel stores located in Massachusetts and Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="7025.951" offset="28103784">Carvel agrees to purchase from Hood all of such requirements.Hood also agrees to manufacture the Carvel mix according to this special secret mix formula furnished to Hood by Carvel, originated by Carvel and it agrees not to disclose that formula to any unauthorized person.</text>
            <text syncTime="7050.500" offset="28201900">And Hood agrees to deliver only Carvel mix to Carvel stores and no other mix and no other ice cream preparation to those stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="7066.603" offset="28266371">Now at the trial, the following facts were established by Hood without contradiction of any kind, they maybe taken as established beyond any peradventure of a doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="7080.779" offset="28323109">They were established not only by stipulation with the plaintiffs but by the uncontroverted live testimony of Hood's witness, Walter Simons.</text>
            <text syncTime="7096.225" offset="28384862">These facts in summary are these, that Hood was not a party to and had no knowledge whatsoever of Carvel's franchise agreements or any other contracts which Carvel had with the store operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="7113.260" offset="28452989">That Hood never saw and had no knowledge of what has been called the standard operating procedure manual and that had -- Hood had nothing whatsoever to do with the manner in which these stores or any of them were operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="7130.650" offset="28522580">And that Carvel process the mix according to Carvel's secret formula which differs from all other ice cream mixes manufactured by Hood.</text>
            <text syncTime="7142.865" offset="28571376">These were the established facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="7145.779" offset="28583079">And in addition, these facts were established beyond any question that Hood did not participate in the determination of the prices at which Carvel sold ice -- its ice cream mix to the store operators or in the determination of the prices to the public of any of Carvel's dairy products made with this ice cream mix as a component.</text>
            <text syncTime="7179.984" offset="28719856">Now we submit that the Carvel-Hood supply contracts involved neither per se violations or antitrust law nor indeed any other violations of antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7194.065" offset="28776176">They cannot possibly be said to be pernicious in their effects upon competition or lacking in the so-called redeeming virtues or in any sense to be unreasonable so that their consequent illegality must be presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7218.645" offset="28874501">Hood's proof affirmatively established -- establishes that the contracts are reasonable and proper for the protection not only of the legitimate proprietary interests of Carvel but also of the store operators themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="7237.466" offset="28949838">And further and more important, they are necessary for the protection of the interests of the consuming public.</text>
            <text syncTime="7247.323" offset="28989231">And there is no proof whatsoever that they have any adverse effect upon competition and certainly, certainly not a pernicious effect.</text>
