            <text syncTime="27.471" offset="109819">Petitioners are 8 young Negro college men whose liberty is at stake because they attempted to eat at a white only cafeteria in Nashville in October 21, 1962 and remained standing at the entrance vestibule after the doorman had barred their way because of their race.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.262" offset="196963">They were convicted of conspiracy by a jury which agreed on a fine of less than $50 although empowered to find on as much as a $1,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.682" offset="238655">The trial judge imposed the fine -- the $50 fine and added a 90-day work house sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.450" offset="273763">Their claims that their conduct was constitutionally protected were rejected on appeal for the state's highest court.</text>

            <label>Mr. James M. Nabrit, III</label>
            <text syncTime="110.636" offset="442514">There is a procedure for a defendant to request that if you done more trial that was not done.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.438" offset="477727">This Court granted certiorari in the case before its decisions in Hamm v. Rock Hill and Blow v. North Carolina holding that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 abated all pending prosecutions for non-forcible attempt to enter or remain in establishments covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.475" offset="573858">Now, this case does not merely involve the liberty of these young men for by its arguments here, Tennessee is attempting, we think to nullify the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by criminal prosecutions brought under a law which the Tennessee Supreme Court itself admitted was originally enacted in 1875 to nullify the Civil Rights Act of 1875 dealing with the public accommodations.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.662" offset="706560">Now we make six somewhat related arguments, and I'd like to state them briefly now as I probably will not have the opportunity to argue them all.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.200" offset="756715">First, we make an abatement argue based on Hamm against Rock Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.670" offset="778658">Second, we make a state action racial discrimination argument premised on Lombard versus Louisiana and Robinson against Florida among other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.815" offset="823171">Third, we make an argument that there's no evidence either of a conspiracy to obstruct the restaurant or of a conspiracy to call the riot two of the things -- two of the several things charged in the indictment and we rely -- we rely on the Thompson versus Louisville doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.425" offset="909688">Fourth, we urged that there was error in instructions to the jury which invited the jury to convict on various unconstitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.581" offset="946260">Including among others, an erroneous instruction about the statutes the defendants were accused of violating.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.044" offset="976144">Trial Judge told the jury three times that the defendants were charged with violating the law which they were not -- they were not accused of.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.793" offset="1019089">And also whether the -- that the trial—</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="258.661" offset="1034553">They charged the jury with something they were not -- didn't get the last word.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_m_nabrit_iii" startTime="263.374" stopTime="531.086">
            <label>Mr. James M. Nabrit, III</label>
            <text syncTime="263.374" offset="1053466">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.211" offset="1056810">The trial judge three times during his instructions to the jury told the jury that these defendants were accused of a conspiracy to violate Section 62-710 of the Tennessee laws which I'll describe in a moment but this is a section briefly that abrogates the common law (Inaudible) and this wasn't true.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.825" offset="1151269">The State Court held that was error but said it didn't see how it could affect the judgment of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.475" offset="1189825">And the other related matters, the fact that the accusation read to the jury as part of the instructions asserted the petitioners went to the restaurant with one of the things they're accused of is going to the restaurant knowing that other people like patrons might attack them.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.928" offset="1295673">Fifth, we make an argument based on Cole against Arkansas that the Appellant Court rested its affirmance on a theory of what the crime was which was completely contrary to the theory on which the case was tried and litigated and submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.229" offset="1368816">And sixth, there's an argument that the jurors were not impartial with respect to the segregation issue which was central to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.357" offset="1409358">Now on the first point, the Hamm v. Rock Hill issue abatement question.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.608" offset="1446348">There is apparently no dispute about the fact that Title II of the Civil Rights Act covers the BMW Cafeteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.659" offset="1482606">State's brief apparently assumes this and we think correctly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.487" offset="1505907">This restaurant is a large 450-seat cafeteria located in Nashville's downtown business district open to the general public and offering to serve interstate travelers, we think within the meaning of Section 201 C2 of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.201" offset="1584797">Also the fact of racial discrimination is undisputed on the evidence and indeed admitted on the face of the grand jury's presenter but the State contends that petitioners are not detected by the Act on the ground that their conduct was not peaceful and asserts that their acts were criminal even if they had a right to eat at the restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.912" offset="1683644">There are several answers to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.244" offset="1700885">At first, the case wasn't tried on this basis and the accusation wasn't made obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.181" offset="1732650">The case was -- accusation proceeded on the theory that the restaurant had a right to exclude these petitioners under a Tennessee law has to give them that right and this was a whole theory of the case in the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.904" offset="1791582">I'm going to talk about the accusation statutes involved and the judge's instructions to the jury and in describing pretending to keep in mind that the scope of -- we submit the scope of abatement under the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.597" offset="1874338">The scope of its protection is the same as the scope of present protection for people who commit acts there under the -- in establishments covered by the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.621" offset="1946436">Now the accusation mentioned three statutes which are set out in our brief and the federal courts petitioners' brief of pages 4 and 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.257" offset="1992934">The first of the statutes is the conspiracy law Section 39-1101 subsection 7 prohibits a conspiracy to commit any act injurious to public health, public morals, trade of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.580" offset="2070256">The indictment alleged the petitioners inspired to injure the trade of business with a BMW Cafeteria in Nashville.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.184" offset="2112679">Now, the next two statutes—</text>

            <text syncTime="611.286" offset="2445061">It's at the top of the second page of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.877" offset="2459481">And it says that the defendants conspired to violate code section 39-1101 7 that is the Conspiracy Law and Section 62-711.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.857" offset="2511412">Now Section 62-711 and the preceding Section 62-710 where Sections 1 and 2 of a single statute passed by Tennessee in March 1874 are the first section abrogated common law duty of innkeepers to serve all commerce, so they could exclude anyone and the second section which prohibits turbulent or right of conduct was designed to enforce the first section.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.962" offset="2671804">And this is the law, I mentioned earlier which a contemporary Tennessee Supreme Court of 1877 asserted was passed to avoid the effects of the Civil Rights Act of 1875.</text>

            <text syncTime="693.529" offset="2774100">They cover the same types of facilities indeed the Federal Act had a $500 penalty against discriminating proprietary and the Tennessee statute turned it around but with $500 civil penalty against a person who attempted to remain in an establishment after being screwed.</text>

            <text syncTime="751.581" offset="3006276">And this is the way in which that second law is brought into the accusation but it's not charged and they violated expressly.</text>

            <text syncTime="909.244" offset="3636976">If I follow you correctly -- if I follow your brief, the resentment here charged the violation of 39-1101 which is a conspiracy statute and finding it to commit any act injurious to public health, public morals, trade or commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.014" offset="3724016">And then it charged the violation of 62-711 penalty for riotous conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.709" offset="3754736">It did not charge although it referred to the 62-710 which defined a right of owners to exclude persons from places of public accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.846" offset="3803324">Now one of your points, I take on your brief and what you've just said is that when the Court charged at page 299, it said that the language of the resentment that the defendants are charged with the offense of the lawful conspiracy to violate code section 39-1017 code section 62-710 and 62-711.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.200" offset="3904784">And you're arguing -- one of your arguments I think it is that there was no charge of conspiracy to deprive one of the right which the statute 62-710 purported to give to an owner a right to exclude persons from places of public accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.596" offset="3970299">And therefore under Court of Arkansas there couldn't be convicted because they were being convicted of a charge which was not lodged against it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.468" offset="4033829">And I would point out that the reference, Your Honor, mentioned on page 299 was only the first of three times the Court told them -- told the jury that the defendants were charged under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.271" offset="4097045">The other second times under the bottom of 302 and the third time is over on page 305.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.891" offset="4127556">Now I think it's important to know about this accusation is the defendants were not charged with disorderly conduct or breach of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.571" offset="4170188">Disorderly conduct or breach of the peace under Tennessee law Section 39-1213 carries only a 30 day sentence whereas the defendants were charged with conspiracy carrying the possible year in jail and a thousand dollar fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.066" offset="4236225">And they were not charged with violating 62-711 directly that only carried a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.428" offset="4277708">They were charged with a conspiracy to violate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.431" offset="4293695">Now we submit that the -- on the abatement argument that the conviction should be reversed just on the face of the accusation because certainly under the Ham case any such accusation as this, if it were filed on the Court today would be obviously fatally defective under the Civil Rights and it's totally a consistent with the Civil Rights Act in 1964, and there was no pretense here as there would -- as there has been in some of the sit-in cases which has come before this Court that something other than racial discrimination was involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.061" offset="4444160">It's on the face of the accusation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.034" offset="4456072">And the same observation, I think applies to the judge's instructions to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.271" offset="4481045">He read the whole resentment with implicit approval to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.682" offset="4502674">He told they made this mistake three times about the statute and then he explained the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.404" offset="4529528">He explained what a conspiracy to commit acts injurious to a business was in these terms at page 300.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.731" offset="4562860">He said that injurious, page 300 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.779" offset="4583027">He said that injurious in this context led an invasion or violation of a legally protected interest or property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.338" offset="4621270">So this invited the jury to convey that merely if it believed that the complainants remain in the restaurant against his wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.377" offset="4657424">And now we -- and again, an instruction that -- that's contrary to the theory of the Civil Rights Act or the Hampton.</text>

            <text syncTime="3494.133" offset="13976451">We think so under the holding in Ingram v. United States that was the tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.015" offset="13999961">There it was said that -- well first American --the Tobacco Company v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.102" offset="14020336">There it was said that you infer the criminal act from the acts that we're doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.172" offset="14036637">You don't have to have an expression of it or anything of that such you infer from circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.691" offset="14062759">Now in the Ingram case, it was said that that if the conspiracy is not one of the major objectives but one of the minor that it no less is still a conspiracy that is punishable as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.953" offset="14135798">In other words, I think that the defendant's first objective was to get in and be fed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.357" offset="14157427">I don't think there's any question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.990" offset="14167876">But when they were not, then they continued to remain in the vestibule and block it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.640" offset="14190550">Now we think that was their second objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.293" offset="14201104">We think it was understood between these eight petitioners because of their conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.349" offset="14229316">First, they all -- I think the record indicate that they all knew that they were not going to be permitted to enter that was common knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.635" offset="14266514">I think the record indicates that I maybe wrong but I think that's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.575" offset="14282292">I think that's really it was alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.830" offset="14291278">That all happened there at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.583" offset="14302250">That all happened there at the time when the restaurant was crowded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.270" offset="14316983">They all stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.626" offset="14322416">They all performed as a unit or as a team throughout the whole incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.783" offset="14351047">There wasn't many questions about what one would do and what the other would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.214" offset="14368810">They all acted in concert but those are the words that I'm trying to use all the way through this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.851" offset="14395350">So we think that the only inference that can be drawn from those circumstances, I thought is that they did act together and that they conspired to do the thing that they had done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.188" offset="14444669">Now, I would like to mention this, the case of Turner v. Memphis that had to do with the house down at the airport at Memphis Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.103" offset="14496392">As my opponents understand that case, they say that this Court declared Section 62-710 unconstitutional and a restaurant regulation that we had in effect at that time to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.526" offset="14554070">Well, I don't understand that case held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.175" offset="14564624">The case said this that there was a question of whether to proceed at that time or to wait I believe for construction of that code section and that restaurant regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.795" offset="14619167">This Court said there was no use to see what the results that was because that statute and that regulation could only be a defense insofar as it's stated an affirmative state policy to segregate and they said under that and then added on their cases that there wouldn't be a defense because it just couldn't be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.715" offset="14714776">So we don't think the State declared them unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.232" offset="14728882">It just said that if they were sought to be used for that purpose of warning the acts of the restaurant and segregating it, that would be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.925" offset="14763677">Now this -- in this reply brief is the first time that the restaurant regulation has been mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.476" offset="14789904">I take it that if it's a part of the law in Tennessee or if it were a part of the law the State could take, I mean this Court could take judicial notice of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.391" offset="14821564">At least this is the first time it's raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.591" offset="14830341">So I'm raising the question about whether or not it can be considered farther been the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.168" offset="14856568">I would say this that I don't know whether that regulation is part of the law or not it says this that when restaurants are open to both white and colored, they should be served separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.700" offset="14910798">And then it goes on to say that sets out some specifics that that would amount to a compliance with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.518" offset="14938070">Now that's the effect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.095" offset="14944340">Well, I don't know whether that -- at the time whether that is -- has the force of law or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.202" offset="14972761">Of course a regulation that is designed for that purpose does have but I would like to say this that one mentioned.</text>
