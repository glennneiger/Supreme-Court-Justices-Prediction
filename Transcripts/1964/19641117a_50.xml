            <text syncTime="206.286" offset="825051">But the fact of the matter is that here's the whole brief of the government and also the reply brief is taken up for this argument that Seeger is not religious and that the contest here is between a nonreligious exemption and a religious exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.728" offset="886909">Now, that is not the issue at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.681" offset="894642">The issue here is -- it is between a religious objector of a certain character who has one concept of religion and the question of whether he has to have a religion based on a relationship to a Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.560" offset="946155">Now, that's the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.740" offset="954932">And that we're not in this case so far as Seeger is concerned on the matter of whether exemption should be given to nonreligious people.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.217" offset="988787">A lot of itself was a very interesting question and raises some important constitutional questions but the question here is whether Congress can make a law which distinguishes between people who believe or religions which believe in a Supreme Being and those which do not believe in a Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.860" offset="1059422">Because the very first question on Seeger's questionnaire which he had answered categorically was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.427" offset="1093695">Do you believe in a Supreme Being?</text>
            <text syncTime="275.725" offset="1102890">Answer, yes or no.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.089" offset="1112294">Now, that's the only choice he has.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.967" offset="1119817">And he put a third box.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.159" offset="1124624">He put it right there, he crossed the third box.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.814" offset="1135177">And he said, the belief in a Supreme Being, the existence of a Supreme Being cannot be proved or disapproved and therefore I would prefer not to answer the question in this form, but this does not mean to say that I have no faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.166" offset="1192647">And that's right in his record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1316.280" offset="5265032">And yet that's precisely what the government is trying to do in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.780" offset="5275063">They're saying that the term religion means in the First Amendment that there has to be a belief in a Supreme Being before it can be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.574" offset="5306201">And I don't believe that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.592" offset="5314351">I think that the term religion is, in my brief, I cited a few definitions but you ask me to define religion, I can't define religion any more than -- than you can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.487" offset="5353848">But there are a lot of people that have defined religion and the government I might say in their brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.766" offset="5379030">I think this is rather a distinct admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.842" offset="5395331">Seeger's views are religious as some careful thinkers and writers used the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.884" offset="5415497">And then he goes on to say down a little bit further that these beliefs are religious in the definitions here they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.761" offset="5439007">One of Seeger's views although is religious as some psychologist and theologians used the term, nevertheless, they are not religious within the meanings of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.704" offset="5470772">Now, if there are theologians that define religion on the terms of Seeger's belief, how can this Court or Congress say that it doesn't include that kind of religion?</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.929" offset="5515703">I don't understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.984" offset="5519882">Is -- was Jefferson right when he says that legislatures are not -- legislators are not in infallible?</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.428" offset="5541616">That's what he said.</text>

            <text syncTime="1569.333" offset="6277329">As my time expires, I think I probably -- I have five minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.046" offset="6296137">Of course, I haven't had chance to review this case in the context to which I wanted to but my brief is rather complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.051" offset="6324140">I say that this law violates the establishment clause because it does give official approval to one type of religion or one concept of religion as against another concept of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.368" offset="6373460">And it -- and it punishes directly or indirectly the person who does not accept the concept set forth in that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.311" offset="6405224">It's an official government sanction of a particular concept of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.604" offset="6422361">And I say it violates the Free Exercise Clause too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.954" offset="6435736">And I say that that's even clearer because the government says in its brief many times that these exemptions are given because they want to protect the free exercise of those people who were covered by these exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.875" offset="6491429">In my reply to that, if that is so, what happens to the people who are religious but who do not come within this definition of religion?</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.064" offset="6520163">What about their free exercise?</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.380" offset="6529463">And I say that the Seeger's free exercise is also prohibited in this case -- this doesn't mean to say that he had a right to the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.903" offset="6587559">I recognize that Congress doesn't have to give exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.949" offset="6599784">I would even recognize that they might limit those exemptions to religious people although I'm not sure about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.183" offset="6628728">But I do say that once they give exemptions, once they give a benefit, once they give an exemption, once they give a privilege, then they've got to apply the equality rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.929" offset="6663628">They've got to be equal as between the people who are getting the benefits as you said in the Speiser case and also in the Sherbert case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.181" offset="6692676">And I go one step further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.246" offset="6696960">I say this is the violation of the Fifth Amendment because here was the classification of religions not raised as it was in the Bolling case but of religions which is in conflict with the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.744" offset="6742936">And therefore the Due Process Clause and the embodiment of the Equal Protection Clause which is in the Fifth Amendment, becomes vey clear in relation to the First Amendment because there you have an exact definition of what Congress can't do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.904" offset="6795598">And therefore you're not rela -- you don't have to fall on the broad definition of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.310" offset="6817228">Now, finally I say that the Selective Draft case had nothing to do with this case because well I think that case was wrongly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.875" offset="6847425">It was based on a different statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.592" offset="6854322">I don't think Congress has a right to exempt only those who belong to duly constituted religions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.538" offset="6874070">But I don't have to argue that point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.991" offset="6879922">I simply say the case doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.590" offset="6890266">Now, to come back to the point of what is religion of the Constitution, I think religion in the Constitution has to cover all kinds of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.234" offset="6924852">I don't think it has to cover acts which are not religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.935" offset="6939690">I don't misunderstand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.151" offset="6944601">I don't think it has to cover acts that are not religious simply because somebody says they're religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.005" offset="6963931">But I think it covers all sincere religious beliefs whether they're based on a belief in a Supreme Being or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.056" offset="6988173">And I don't believe the Congress has a right to draw a line which was not drawn in the Constitution in relation to the protections and the benefits of the First Amendment by distinguishing between theistic and nontheistic religions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.072" offset="7040209">And I think that the government -- now unless this Court wants to overturn the definition of religion in the Kauten case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.699" offset="7070720">I think the case have been tried and decided on the theory that this man is religious under the terms of religion in the Kauten case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.601" offset="7098305">If you don't agree with that, then of course, then he's not -- maybe he isn't religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.135" offset="7116487">I don't know.</text>

            <text syncTime="1882.131" offset="7528490">The books will tell you that that's the number -- over 45% of Americans who belong to no church, no organized religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1902.619" offset="7610410">I personally think that Mr. Seeger is a very religious man and I think that he's religious in the same sense essentially that some of our great statesmen who are religious that is, they have a sense of religion which is not compelled by a god who's going to say, “If you do this, you're going to be punished and if you don't do this, you're not going to be punish or you're going to get some afterlife benefits if you do this, and so on.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.458" offset="7705809">He believes in religion in the sense that he wants to think that goodness should be related to this life and to the conscience which is compelling him to do these things.</text>

            <text syncTime="2580.210" offset="10320771">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.272" offset="10337071">The case to which I am going to address my argument is the Peter case, Number 29, which was discussed in the argument of the Solicitor General yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.717" offset="10374792">And it's here on writ of certiorari issued to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.007" offset="10396003">The Ninth Circuit affirmed the conviction of Forest Britt Peter for refusing to submit himself to induction into the armed services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.087" offset="10432261">As the Solicitor General indicated yesterday Peter had maintained throughout the proceedings before the draft board, the trial court, as he was entitled to exemption as a conscientious objector under Section 6 (j) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.366" offset="10501433">There are two questions before the Court in the Peter case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.481" offset="10517838">One is the constitutional question of which has been discussed in Seeger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.001" offset="10535915">But the threshold of the question is whether Peter qualifies under the Supreme Being test as it is written and properly construed in the Section 6 (j) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.905" offset="10583562">More specifically, it is our contention that the Ninth Circuit has misconstrued and misinterpreted the Supreme Being test and accordingly the wrong rule of law was applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.291" offset="10637061">A similar case, similar question will also be raised in the Jakobson case because both Jakobson and Peter had taken that position that the do need the requirements of the Supreme Being Test a position which Seeger does not take.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.653" offset="10706547">As the government has stated, neither the constitutional nor the statutory questions in any of these cases can be properly considered without having firmly in mind the nature of the beliefs which are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.486" offset="10761927">And accordingly at the outset, I would like to summarize Peter's statement of the belief as presented in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.847" offset="10799334">I think it's proper to dispose it once however I have certain misconceptions that I think may have arisen in the Solicitor General's argument with respect to Peter and some of his background, some of his beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.715" offset="10854818">I think that there are certain considerations that were raised here which cannot be properly accepted by the Court in reaching a decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.570" offset="10890240">I refer to several of the factors to which the Solicitor General mentioned as convincing him and supported the government's position that Peter's claims were properly denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.319" offset="10933185">It was mentioned for example that Peter had no religious background, no family religion in the course of his being raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.870" offset="10971429">It was also mentioned that Peter did not originally claim an exemption at the time that he registered for the draft or filled out the classification form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.615" offset="11010403">Thirdly, it was mentioned that he belongs to no religious sect, and has adopted no body or organized body of systematic religious principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.468" offset="11053871">He was pictured as being a person who is just stubborn in his own intellectual convictions with respect to any number of things that he considers important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.812" offset="11099220">Now, these considerations are relevant only to the question of whether Peter was sincere in his beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.881" offset="11139448">They have no relevance as to the substantive content or the nature of what suppose the beliefs are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.767" offset="11163063">And of course, it's perfectly true that a conscientious objector registrant may be denied his exemption status that he is shown to be insincere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.558" offset="11202142">But the question of insincerity has been eliminated from this record altogether for purposes of decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.996" offset="11231922">The Ninth Circuit and I'm quoting from its opinion, has assumed that the appellant petitioner here was absolutely sincere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.728" offset="11270896">Instead, the sole basis for the Ninth Circuit's decision was that it felt that Peter did not qualify having met the -- as having met the Supreme Being test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.328" offset="11317290">So the question is not sincerity, the question is not whether it was religious background and Peter has avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.762" offset="11342994">Or what time that he raised the question of his exemption status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.650" offset="11366504">The question is what is the content of his beliefs as stated in the record?</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.795" offset="11383118">And do they meet the Supreme Being test?</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.224" offset="11412793">When the classification form was originally filled out, not the classification form that the forms for the conscientious objector was originally filled out by Peter in this case, he came to the question of which said, do you believe in the Supreme Being?</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.566" offset="11482175">And he wrote in the form at that point, “It depends on the definition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.584" offset="11506312">He expanded his views in a separate sheet which he attached to the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.546" offset="11530136">And incidentally, this statement of his that depends on the definition, appear throughout all of the various proceedings which Peter went through before the draft board, the appeal board even into the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.183" offset="11580709">He was never certain that any time, what the government meant by the term Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.530" offset="11606100">And I suspect that our presence here today would indicate that he has some reason to be uncertain himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.738" offset="11638909">There is uncertainty perhaps in the phraseology inherently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.906" offset="11663569">But in the sheet which he attached to the form, he's made the following statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.579" offset="11702230">He says, the human life for me is a final value like this --</text>

            <text syncTime="2937.374" offset="11749460">Since the human life form is for me a final value, I considered a violation of moral law to take human life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.017" offset="11776000">I think I have reached this conviction out of my reading of such writings as those of Blake, (a Christian mystique) noted in parenthesis, Emerson, Whitman, and Moore, modern poets who have touched on the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.205" offset="11824797">I consider this belief to be superior to my obligation to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.062" offset="11840157">And insofar as this conviction is religious, it has been best described by Reverend John Haynes Holmes as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.799" offset="11871190">Religion is the consciousness of some power manifest in nature which helps man in the ordering of his life in harmony with his demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.228" offset="11908911">It is the supreme expression of human nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="2986.478" offset="11945900">He also made his statement in the same form on the same page of the record indicating that he believed that human life and human experience was -- and the human spirit was sacred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.515" offset="12010057">Before the draft board, Peter submitted other statements that supported his position and an explanation of his beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.993" offset="12039941">And he wrote as follows in one of the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.568" offset="12050181">This is on page 33 of the record which is reprinted on page 4 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.163" offset="12072647">I quote, “I have this god inside me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.512" offset="12086021">To be truthful, I don't know if it's a long or short god, or even a superior god much less a Supreme Being.</text>

            <text syncTime="3054.519" offset="12217992">It opens me to godliness in the world.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.576" offset="12234292">Before the appeal board, he furnished a further statement stating it very briefly on page -- this is on page 57 of the record, I believe, that he is moved by many of the elements in the world and creation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.654" offset="12290612">He states, he might say I believe in them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3078.935" offset="12315690">In subsequent statements including a letter to General Hershey, he refers to -- now I'm quoting from page -- from the letter beginning on page 82 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.586" offset="12366263">He says, “I place the stress of my belief on the products, the elements in creation rather than on a reverence towards the possible creator of these elements and this piece of the universe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.684" offset="12406700">These are reverence for the elements in the universe before that of the possible creator might be an orthodox but it does not foreign to religious thought (witness the writings of Buddha those were attributed to him and early followers).</text>

            <text syncTime="3131.185" offset="12524669">He also states that he feels that it's proper to turn his conviction religious because it's based I'm quoting, “on a vision and a dedication to that vision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.776" offset="12559047">And I feel this vision and my commitment to it, it's into a depth of tradition having gotten into specific historical group.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.876" offset="12587468">He says further, “I motivated by what Albert Schweitzer calls a reverence for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.296" offset="12609097">I think of myself as a receptive organ through which the tragedy and beauty of the world are perceived.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3326.274" offset="13304999">I think that his beliefs probably can best be -- if they have to be classified at all into a -- into the category of mysticism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.665" offset="13342616">He certainly acknowledges some type of power by these beliefs, some type of power that exists</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.134" offset="13420460">But its existence is nonetheless acknowledged and I don't think it's possible to deal with the statements that I have summarized here in any other way it is consistent with what they mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.156" offset="13472601">Now, the Ninth Circuit determined that these beliefs did not come within the definition of Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.055" offset="13508127">At this point, I think that it's very important to understand the precise question before the Court in terms of the decision that must make in view of the Ninth Circuit's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.499" offset="13565910">And here, I feel the government has not put the question with sufficient preciseness with deference to the -- the government and particularly to his advocate into his class when I learned the law when he followed a somewhat different calling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.809" offset="13631216">I think that the question is not whether the -- there would be support in this record or the draft board to find that Peter did not believe in a Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.973" offset="13679804">Rather the question is whether the Ninth Circuit has applied the correct rule of law in adjudicating the record before it, in adjudicating Peter's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.243" offset="13732885">The Ninth Circuit, this is fundamental to my position here, has taken the view that Supreme Being under Section 6 (j) of the Act requires a belief and a duty indeed I think -- well I can go so far as to say an anthropomorphic god.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.736" offset="13802893">That appears as far as I can discern to be the point of view and the point of departure for the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.300" offset="13829120">In this sense, we have a different situation that we have in either of the Jakobson case or the Seeger case both of which came out f the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.666" offset="13870602">Now, I think that it's important to demonstrate that the Ninth Circuit has done what I have stated because it does alter the nature of the question to be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.668" offset="13922638">If I am correct in saying that the Ninth Circuit has applied the wrong rule of law and has misinterpreted Section 6 (j), I don't think that this conviction up here can stand irrespective of what the regional trier of fact might have been able to conclude on the basis of the various fragments in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.861" offset="14007380">The reason that I give for my view of what the Ninth Circuit has followed in this case, are as follows, the fundamental decision which the Ninth Circuit has followed, since these World War II period is the Berman case that was its own decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.526" offset="14086060">In Berman, the Ninth Circuit departed from the Kauten view that religion and under the 1940 Act could be -- could include -- was comprehensive enough to include the voice of conscience, and said that it was -- that religion required something more than that, and to determine, to articulate what more was required the Ninth Circuit in Berman quoted Justice Hughes' dissent in the Macintosh case, and the quote was as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.174" offset="14232660">“The essence of religion is belief in a relation to god involving duties superior to those arising from many human relations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.375" offset="14265469">And secondly, the Berman case also quoted Justice Hughes' language in the same case, Macintosh case, philosophy, and morals, and social policy without the concept of deity cannot be said to be religion in a sense of that term as it is used in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.379" offset="14341433">Berman, as I see it stands for the proposition that religion and a belief in a deity are one and the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.080" offset="14384274">In the Peter case, the case told him before the Court the Ninth Circuit not only relied on the Berman but quoted the same descending language of Justice Hughes where he equates religion with a belief in God.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.425" offset="14449685">Now this, in my view, is an erroneous interpretation of Congress' intent when it used the term Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.449" offset="14493780">I think that Congress meant a concept broader than an anthropomorphic deity but it used Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.075" offset="14528261">And in this point of view, I have the company of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.856" offset="14551353">The government accepts that same basic interpretation of the word Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.414" offset="14573610">But the government says nothing about the Berman case or nothing about the Peter's decision of the Ninth Circuit which in my view makes quite an opposite reading of the term Supreme Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.246" offset="14624914">This places the Peter case in a somewhat different context I think but neither the Seeger nor the Jakobson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.552" offset="14654171">We are dealing here as you see with the decision of the court below which has interpreted Supreme Being not as the Second Circuit has but to require some kind of acceptance of a anthropomorphic deity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.478" offset="14721881">If the Ninth Circuit is wrong in that respect, as the government would indicate if it's so to use the import of the decision, then the conviction cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.297" offset="14777156">And I think that it becomes incumbent to view to require the Ninth Circuit to review at the least or I think in this particular record, this case would –- with this the Court would have the option itself of reviewing the record and coming out with the determination that Peter's beliefs qualify him for exemption under the correct reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.255" offset="14869002">The correct reading of the statute and here again the government and I in Court is that acceptance of any type of faith or belief and that authority beyond that and there, and call it what you will, some ultimate authority which goes beyond human relationships, then there is an adequate basis for the exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="4586.750" offset="18346945">That is correct, Your Honor and I've cited that in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.097" offset="18356349">If I've given various examples of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.278" offset="18373068">Now, he said they were givens of life, givens which are given from deity such as life which must be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4599.523" offset="18398041">His duty is to learn about it and protect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.206" offset="18412774">He said his acceptance of the world involved altruism, brotherhood, and love of fellowmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.746" offset="18438896">And he said the man is closer to God.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.437" offset="18445688">I said one point is this godness is deity, and he says man is closer to godness when he says, I will not allow myself to be inducted into the arm services is because of the way I feel about human life and one who says I wonder if they'll suddenly overseas, I always did want to travel, which certainly shows a superior duty to his fellowmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.881" offset="18523429">And he said that man is obeying a higher law than a social or legal one when he basis his action and attitudes to stem from the way he feels about the basic givens of life, the basic givens means there's something given by deity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.204" offset="18576718">Now, the government says all these beliefs are personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4649.137" offset="18596467">And here's what he says.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.042" offset="18600124">The essence of his religious quest to seeking knowledge of the ultimate nature of that created by the supreme reality or man in searching for moral standards which is divinely given reason could accept or satisfying the ultimate nature of man.</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.084" offset="18660310">The government says that his most important religious lord of no man or that will ever willfully sacrifice another man's life didn't qualify as his superior duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4674.092" offset="18696359">But respondent preceded this statement when he said life is all that man has ever given, all of these arranged by man.</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.067" offset="18728229">Divinely given things are very warmth joy, sense of aliveness because of this life is sacred.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.596" offset="18758322">Death ends divinely given things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.501" offset="18765949">And that's why he couldn't kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4694.142" offset="18776503">Now, the government says that respondent did know the nature of deity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.653" offset="18790609">Of course, that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="4698.548" offset="18794162">No religion ever professed to know the nature of deity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.859" offset="18803357">We have that in the case of Moses and the burning bush when God appeared before Moses in the form of a burning bush.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.737" offset="18826867">And then there could be many others in the New Testament in the form when a voice came out of the clouds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4711.629" offset="18846511">I've cited these in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4714.185" offset="18856647">Now, it also says that prior forth that he disagreed with theism.</text>
            <text syncTime="4718.458" offset="18873783">He didn't disagree with theism.</text>
            <text syncTime="4719.938" offset="18879739">He merely said he didn't posit theism.</text>
            <text syncTime="4722.706" offset="18890815">On the other hand even if he disagreed with theism, Paul Tillich and that's quoted, and this is quoted in the opinion of the Court of Appeals below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.479" offset="18925819">He said -- Paul Tillich said that theism is transcended by absolute faith, the government itself in its argument and in his brief said that Paul Tillich is a man of religion when they accept him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.625" offset="18974407">The government further said that these views are political and sociological.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.805" offset="18991125">Well of course political and sociological views in the first place can't be religious and are religious if they are backed up by deity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.828" offset="19023308">And all the churches and all the center gods practice politics and religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.849" offset="19047340">Politics and sociology and economy and all these different practices because that has to do with man and must be part of religion because the religion is concerned with these things as long as it is supported by deity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.176" offset="19096660">It all comes from the laws of God that we must be interested in our fellowmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.943" offset="19119752">Now, when I say these views are sociological and political, he said he faced his conscientious objection in the above convictions which said that God is the creator of man.</text>
            <text syncTime="4790.053" offset="19160189">Life is all that he has ever given.</text>
            <text syncTime="4791.773" offset="19167086">Life is sacred.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.569" offset="19170220">No man ought ever sacrificed other man's life.</text>
            <text syncTime="4794.876" offset="19179416">Now, this certainly is not a personal, political, or sociological reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.332" offset="19197283">He even when he explained it into more detail, he said that war is incompatible with this most sacred conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4808.766" offset="19235004">Even the most deprived persons have spiritual aspect, all this -- all the same as anybody else in relation to deity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.606" offset="19270322">These are all values, the basement was contradicted to sacred convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4824.470" offset="19297802">Now he entered some questions that regard to under what circumstances he would use force.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.294" offset="19321104">And he said that all his answers were these and so that anything he said which sounds personal was not personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.178" offset="19344614">I'm not personal because they all are related to this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.653" offset="19358511">They have the result of these basic religious convictions concerning the sanctity of life and the dignity of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.747" offset="19382962">Now, these certainly do stem from deity and in that person at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.338" offset="19405322">And finally he whines it up by saying, one can stand for the sanctity of life by not killing when his most sacred convictions tell him not to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.853" offset="19443357">Now, even if we assume that some of these reasons were personal, I'm not conceding it but I'm going to assume it that some of these reasons were personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.775" offset="19471047">He gave enough reasons which were related to deity to cause him to be accepted as religious statements, the mere fact that some people have certain personal reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.065" offset="19512216">There are only some of them who are personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.650" offset="19518589">The others who are religious could not be tracked from that and this Court has actually held that and -- and the Sicurella case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.554" offset="19550145">The mere fact of having some convictions, religious and some not, if the religious convictions meet the statute six, Section 6 (j) then all the religious statements are accepted and qualify the person to be within the section.</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.112" offset="19616392">The -- we say that when the Department of Justice recommended that these beliefs were moral beliefs that that was an erroneous recommendation and therefore the classification cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4918.315" offset="19673234">There was a very important paper even submitted to the hearing officer in which religious beliefs were set forth and this was called a moral statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.403" offset="19705522">And whereas it actually set forth statements of religious convictions in which he say it refers to the spirit of this godness and he said this godness was the same as Gandhi's real presence of god within.</text>
            <text syncTime="4938.715" offset="19754841">And then he whined up by saying “God is love”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.610" offset="19766439">And these certainly are religious statements and when the Court made -- when the Department of Justice made these statements that calling it moral convictions then of course, it meant an erroneous recommendation to the appeal board and it should be set aside.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herman Adlerstein</label>
            <text syncTime="4986.800" offset="19947102">It starts so by saying religion consists of a deeply felt consistent set of values and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.411" offset="19973642">And then I refer to the second paragraph where he equates his godness with Gandhi's mysterious power and which he whined up and says he felt the real presence of God within which is at the very bottom of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="5015.371" offset="20061414">And then the bottom of page 20 -- 129 which is two pages later says, thus the expression, “God is love for all these limitations, thus succeed in pointing to an objective source of morality.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5029.189" offset="20116689">Now, this god then was called by the hearing officer a statement on a moral position in spite of all these references to deity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.827" offset="20155246">The local board found the respondent to be honest in his beliefs, and therefore accepted all the statements and religion, and otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.313" offset="20193176">On the other hand, the hearing officer because of the certain suspicion of the timing of his claim and making a claim deferment for a back injury has said that he was insincere claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5060.163" offset="20240614">So he made two recommendations that he was insincere and also that his belief was a moral code and not a religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5068.420" offset="20273633">In view of the fact that he made an erroneous recommendation regarding the moral code instead of religion and the appeal board not having decided on which ground it was making its classification, therefore, the classification cannot stand the course of the two contradictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.043" offset="20332147">There was a contradictory report and we have no way of knowing which -- which one was adopted and that the court below assumed that the adopted, the statement that these beliefs were moral.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.057" offset="20380212">And further the Court said that unless a broad interpretation that was made by the statute to include this religion as well as other religions, it might be unconstitutional and in order to avoid a possible unconstitutionality, this religion must be considered equal to all other religions that have been within Section 6 (j) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5118.466" offset="20473835">Thank you.</text>
