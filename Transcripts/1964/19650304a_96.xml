            <label>Mr. Harris K. Weston</label>
            <text syncTime="13.680" offset="54648">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, Mr. Lindley.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.528" offset="74083">This case comes to this Court on an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio, which in effect upheld certain taxing statutes of the State of Ohio against the claim that they were invalid under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.630" offset="154436">The facts in this case are not in dispute and they were stipulated in the lower proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.804" offset="183171">Appellant, Reserve Life Insurance Company, is a Texas Insurance Company, a stock insurance company, a legal reserve company incorporated under the laws of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.131" offset="228519">It has been doing business in Ohio ever since 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.436" offset="249731">And during that time, it has fully complied with the statutes and all of the rules and requirements of the Department of Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.256" offset="280973">During this period of time, it has also paid annually the franchise tax which the State of Ohio requires of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.092" offset="312320">It has never paid a personal property tax and no request of it was made to pay such a tax until 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.900" offset="351504">At that time, a reserve -- a promptly raised the objection of the Equal Protection Clause of the constitution and has pressed out objection at every stage of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.795" offset="399151">The law in question before this Court is the Ohio Personal Property Tax Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.883" offset="431438">It is applied generally on all tangible personal property used in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.185" offset="460696">As applied to this case, it applies to furniture, fixtures, office equipment owned by Reserve Life Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.437" offset="505731">A foreign life insurance company in Ohio is subject to this personal property tax, probably by the definition of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.937" offset="555677">In addition to that, the tax commissioner has issued a rule under -- acting under the statute which gives him the right to designate additional taxpayers not included in the definition and he has issued a specific rule stating that foreign life insurance companies are taxpayers under the Ohio Personal Property Tax Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.678" offset="650658">In any event, the Courts of Ohio have construed the law to apply to a foreign life insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.955" offset="687752">The Court of Appeals in this case said that the foreign insurance company was included in the statute itself and that the rule of the tax commissioner was really of no effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.895" offset="739579">In any case, by the statute, the rule of the tax commissioner and the Court, in other words by the legislative executive and judicial branches of the Government of Ohio of foreign insurance company is required to pay this personal property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.207" offset="808751">It is equally clear that a domestic -- in other words, an Ohio insurance company does not pay this personal property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.120" offset="844382">This comes about through two statutes; the first is the definition statute Section 5701 in subparagraph (b) (3), excludes a domestic insurance company from the definition of a taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.874" offset="935393">It says, “Taxpayer excludes all individuals, partnerships, corporations, associations and joint stock companies, their executors, administrators and receivers who are defined in Title 57 as financial institutions, dealers and intangibles domestic insurance companies or public utilities”.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.781" offset="1019089">So a domestic insurance company is excluded from a definition of taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.670" offset="1046674">In addition to that, the Section of the Ohio Code that imposes a franchise tax on -- an Ohio insurance company has a provision that reads in this way, “The real estate of a domestic insurance company shall be taxed in a place where it is located the same as the real estate of other person is taxed”.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.075" offset="1156284">But the tax provided for by Section 5725 (0) (1) to 26 includes even -- those are the franchise tax sections shall be in lieu of all other taxes on the other property and assets of such domestic insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.849" offset="1219396">So that both by definition section and by this in lieu of provision a -- an Ohio insurance company does not pay this personal property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.529" offset="1270073">Now, to complete the picture in regard to Ohio taxes as applied to these two types of companies because this may be important to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.654" offset="1314586">I would like to say briefly that both of these types of companies do pay the real estate tax, obviously at the same rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.505" offset="1350008">Neither pays an intangible personal property tax and both pay a franchise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.177" offset="1384699">The franchise tax is not the same, however for the two companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.810" offset="1403193">A foreign insurance company pays a franchise tax at the rate of 2.5% of its gross premiums from Ohio business less certain deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.268" offset="1449064">A domestic insurance company has a choice of two methods of computing its franchise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.721" offset="1474873">One is at the rate of one and two-thirds percent of its gross premiums less the same deductions and the Court will observe that 2.5% is 50% higher than 1 2/3%, so that a foreign insurance company pays a franchise tax 50% higher than a domestic insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.851" offset="1567347">In addition, a domestic insurance company has an alternative method of paying the tax which is based on its capital and surplus and it would use that method only if it should be cheaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.542" offset="1622100">And of course if it uses that method, then the discrimination between the franchise taxes would be greater than 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.462" offset="1653760">But in any case, foreign company pays a franchise tax at least 50% higher than the domestic one.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.292" offset="1685107">We thus have the tax structure of Ohio as applied to these companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.175" offset="1704647">Each pays a real estate tax at the same rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.537" offset="1718126">Neither pays a personal property tax on intangibles.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.997" offset="1735889">A foreign insurance company only pays a personal property tax on tangible personal property, and each pays a franchise tax but the foreign company's tax is at least 50% higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.125" offset="1788447">Now, in this case --</text>

            <text syncTime="586.509" offset="2346005">Although interestingly enough, a -- the case of Hanover Fire Insurance Company versus Harding suggests that the proper test ought to be that the state could impose through its police power of requirements for admission which would be different from the requirements of a domestic company and while it doesn't go into this it would appear to be this would be -- the amount of securities that it must have on hand to protect policy holders or an adequate provision to be sure that its record are in good shape and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.331" offset="2525309">But that -- to the extent the tax is to raise revenue for the state as oppose to the police power to protect the citizens, then they should be equal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harris K. Weston</label>
            <text syncTime="679.669" offset="2718616">The -- our principal case on which we rely here is the case of Wheeling Steel Corporation versus Glander, this is 337 U.S. 562.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.634" offset="2766472">It is perhaps interesting that this also came up from the State of Ohio and also involved the Ohio personal property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.551" offset="2806178">In the Wheeling Steel case, Ohio had construed its statute to apply to accounts receivable owned by -- certain account receivable owned by foreign companies but not the same type of accounts receivable owned by domestic companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.257" offset="2896980">This was challenged on the ground of the Equal Protection Clause, and the Court held that it was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.186" offset="2940656">And it drew this distinction that has been alluded to by Mr. Justice White, in fact perhaps because of this I should read the full quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.758" offset="2982975">It said, “Under a long settled principles of our federation, Ohio was not required to admit these foreign corporations to carry on intrastate business within its boarders.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.129" offset="3024457">The state may arbitrarily exclude them or may license them upon any terms it sees fit apart from exacting surrender of rights derived from the constitution of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.906" offset="3067611">Ohio elected however to admit this corporations to transact business and operate manufacturing plants in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.316" offset="3093211">For that privilege, they have paid all that the state required by way of franchise or privilege tax which includes in its measure the value of all property owned and business done in Ohio.”</text>
            <text syncTime="784.906" offset="3139605">Then this part which I would particularly like to emphasize, “After a state has chosen to domesticate foreign corporations, the adopted corporations are entitled to equal protection with the state's own corporate progeny, at least to the extent that their property is entitled to an equally favorable ad valorem tax basis.”</text>
            <text syncTime="806.550" offset="3226122">Ohio holds this tax on intangibles to be an ad valorem property tax and in no sense a franchise privilege occupation or income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.345" offset="3261336">Here of course, again, there is no question whatsoever that this is a property tax, an ad valorem property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.471" offset="3289861">And we think that we come clearly within that announcement of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.373" offset="3321417">Let me turn briefly to certain points raised by the Court of Appeals and the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.374" offset="3357466">One is, there are some talk in the -- in that decision, that the personal property of domestic insurance company is not expressly exempted (Inaudible) -- exempted in quotes does not say in so many word in -- does not use the word exempt but the effect is equally clear is a -- domestic insurance company is excluded and it does use that word from the definition of a taxpayer under the personal property tax and the franchise tax laws says that it is in lieu of all other taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.368" offset="3477420">So it's perfectly clear that a domestic insurance company does not pay a personal property tax on this personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.696" offset="3518694">Secondly, there is the possibility alluded to of an equalizing tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.287" offset="3541055">Some other form of tax that makes up for this fact and as for that reason that we have explained the real estate tax, the intangible personal property tax, and the franchise tax, to show clearly that there is no tax that an Ohio company pays that a foreign company does not pay that would act as a balancing feature, none whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.414" offset="3641574">The Court of Appeals mentions the possibility of reasonable classifications and of course a state may classify companies and it may have for instance a different type of tax on utilities or it may have as Ohio has chosen to have for its domestic company the different type of tax for insurance companies that it has for manufacturing companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.756" offset="3738958">But there is no difference here between the foreign insurance company and the domestic one except the residence of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.176" offset="3784620">And again, I would like to make a quote from the Wheeling Steel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.823" offset="3807190">This is at 572, “If on the taxing date, one of these petitioners and an Ohio competitor --” one of these petitions that were two cases is actually litigating the Wheeling Steel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.424" offset="3849613">“One of this petitioners and an Ohio competitor each owns an accounts receivable of the same amount from the same out-of-state customer for the same type of commodity, both shipped from the manufacturing plant in Ohio and both sold out of Ohio by an agent having an office out-of-the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.274" offset="3909068">Appellant's account receivable would be subject to Ohio's ad valorem tax and the one held by the competing domestic corporation would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.076" offset="3940206">It seems obvious that appellants are not accorded equal treatment and the inequality is not because of the slightest deference in Ohio's relationship -- relation to the decisive transaction, but solely because of the different residence of the owner.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.115" offset="4000392">And we submit that the exact same situation is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.868" offset="4023380">One or two other brief references, there's a sort of a suggestion in the Court of Appeals that maybe it's necessary to look to Texas law and see if there are some sort of balancing feature there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.849" offset="4063295">But it's clear I think that Texas law could not tax in any way personal property in Ohio and the only law that Texas has that has any bearing on an Ohio insurance company is a so-called Retaliatory Tax Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.489" offset="4133930">Ohio has this, almost all state possibly all, but I know almost all states have this Retaliatory Tax Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.724" offset="4162873">And what they say is, “That if another state taxes an Ohio Insurance Company to do business there at a greater rate than Ohio tax is that other state's company doing business in Ohio, and Ohio shall impose the same tax on a company of another state doing business in Ohio as that other state imposes on an Ohio company.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.739" offset="4262870">Now, Texas has that law but this cannot at all affect the personal property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.801" offset="4291187">Oh, I might say by way of passing that because of the discriminatory Ohio franchise tax, there is at least one company in Ohio, insurance company that pays in 33 other states, not on the basis of their franchise tax but on the basis of their Retaliatory Tax because Ohio's tax on other companies doing business in Ohio is so much higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.650" offset="4394527">The Court of Appeals also indicates that there might be some difficulty in granting us the relief we asked even if we're entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.734" offset="4426919">This seems a little bit weird but there doesn't appeared to be any difficulty, if this Court should nullify the tax then we just wouldn't have to pay it and if Ohio wants to -- if Ohio legislature wants to look at its tax structure again, it could, but there's no difficulty in bringing this about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.810" offset="4507167">In one final argument which is raised by the appellee in its answer brief here, and that is essentially that since it may discriminate against us in regard to a franchise tax, why it may discriminate against us in any other form if wants to in addition?</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.996" offset="4587938">Now, this also seems very strange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.666" offset="4602567">It would indicate that they could discriminate against us if this argument were adopted, the real state tax, type of gasoline taxes we would pay, anything at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.992" offset="4643944">In addition to the logical difficulty, it seems clear that this Court not only in the Wheeling Steel case but also in the Hanover Insurance Company Case, Hanover Fire Insurance Company versus Harding held exactly to the contrary and I made this quotation from the Wheeling Steel case that they can -- Ohio can make us pay an extra franchise tax but must treat us equally on ad velorem taxes and that --</text>

            <text syncTime="1295.461" offset="5181753">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.516" offset="5198054">I think the first thing that we should do is to place this case in proper perspective of pointing out that it is true that the real estate of both domestic and foreign insurance companies in Ohio is taxed in the same manner and this is pursuant to an Ohio constitutional provision which requires all real estate to be taxed by uniform rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.524" offset="5282064">It has nothing to do with any belief in the legislature that the real estate tax is tied in any way with franchise tax or the personal property tax insofar as these provisions are concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.422" offset="5341623">Also, it is true that the intangibles of insurance companies both domestic and foreign are exempted in taxation in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.347" offset="5385300">The franchise tax on insurance companies in Ohio both foreign and domestic is upon the same basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.928" offset="5411631">Under certain conditions, the rate of franchise tax on domestics is 1.67% and the rate on foreigns is 2.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.226" offset="5460846">The appellant has indicated that this is a 50% discrepancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.172" offset="5476624">I think it is just as logical to point out that this is a difference in rate of slightly less than 1%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.396" offset="5505567">Using the appellant's line of argument, the discrepancy in the case of Prudential Insurance Company versus Benjamin which was mentioned is in North Carolina case must have been an infinite discrepancy because there, as I recall that case, the domestics were taxed at 0% and foreigns at 3% and a discrepancy on a ratio of basis from zero to three becomes infinite.</text>

            <text syncTime="1407.902" offset="5631582">Could it -- a large enough difference where Ohio to be interested in it, as I gather?</text>

            <text syncTime="1412.736" offset="5650913">Yes it is, certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.579" offset="5666273">Just as in the case of the Lincoln National Insurance Company in Oklahoma, the 2% was large enough so that take to be interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.398" offset="5713502">Now, Section 5725.25 of the Ohio Revised Code does provide that the franchise tax levied on domestic insurance companies shall be in lieu of all other taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.420" offset="5777659">And Section 5711.01 of the Ohio Revised Code which levies a personal property tax does provide by the definition of taxpayer that domestic insurance company shall be excluded, these are companion sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.472" offset="5837845">But the mere fact that you have an in lieu of provision in Section 5725.25 does not automatically mean that we must be able to find some specific substitute for that tax in some other provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.117" offset="5900434">The legislature of the State of Ohio has attempted and has seen fit to provide a tax discrepancy or may point out I think that we are not here concerned with a question of commerce or equality in commerce such as the appellant mentions at Page 18 in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.019" offset="5987997">I think this Court has recognized and the Congress has recognized that in the area of insurance companies, states have a vital concern in the taxation and regulation of insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.473" offset="6049855">I submit that as we understand the rule, it is not every discrepancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.821" offset="6075246">It is not every distinction that has been denied under the Equal Protection Clause of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.269" offset="6117042">It is our understanding that those distinctions which have a rational basis maybe approved and this Court has held that legislation will be sustained where there are conceivable rational basis for the legislative act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.415" offset="6205649">Now, I think it is certainly conceivable and rational to assume that the legislature of the State of Ohio had a desire to foster the development and creation of insurance companies within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.988" offset="6251938">These are desirable types of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.173" offset="6264686">It is also I think reasonable to assume that the legislature of the State of Ohio knew or believed that domestic insurance companies would own more real estate in Ohio than foreign insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.089" offset="6328320">After all, most domestic insurance companies have their home offices in the states in which they are domestic company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.700" offset="6358727">In this sense then, even though the franchise tax rate is different and even though the domestic insurance companies are taxed under the franchise tax law and in lieu of personal property tax the domestic companies may have pay in relation to their total business an amount comparable with the amount paid in taxes by foreign insurance companies.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edgar L. Lindley</label>
            <text syncTime="1698.399" offset="6793509">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.443" offset="6809704">Now, the appellant has relied very strongly on Wheeling Steel and we also rely on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.764" offset="6855053">And I submit to the Court that the appellant has overlooked one controlling factor in Wheeling Steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.717" offset="6886818">First of all, Wheeling Steel was a company which had been admitted to do business in Ohio in 1923 and then the companion case National Distillers Products Corporation, that company was admitted in 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.066" offset="6952229">Now, this case came up as a result and this is recited in a certificate form the tax commissioner which is quoted by this Court in its opinion, “As a result of not just an interpretation of the bare words of the statute on the statute books but of the interpretation of the law as enacted by the Ohio legislature, as construed by the Ohio Supreme Court and then as administratively applied by the tax commission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.527" offset="7082005">Now, the construction by the Ohio Supreme Court in that case occurred in 1944.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.391" offset="7109486">Before that case was decided by the Ohio Supreme Court, both domestic and foreign companies were insofar as the type of accounts receivable there involved concerned, taxed in exactly the same basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.412" offset="7161626">The certificate which excluded by this Court and its opinion in the Wheeling Steel case recites that since the decision of the Randolph and Ransom case in 1944, the tax commissioner's policy was to tax only the accounts receivable of the nature there involved of foreign insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.052" offset="7272176">Now this Court said in that case that in questions of constitutional law, one must look not only at the law but at the administration and at the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.267" offset="7313032">So what we had in the Wheeling Steel case was a change in the law through judicial interpretation and administrative application which resulted in a different treatment after the companies had been admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.979" offset="7371860">And that difference was to the disparagement of the foreign companies and to the enhancement of the domestics, and this Court I think promptly found that that was an unreasonable distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.627" offset="7422433">Now, what do we have in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.672" offset="7442599">In this case, we have a foreign insurance company which applied for admission into the State of Ohio in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.708" offset="7486798">It applied for admission under the law as then as it is today, under a law which excluded from the definition of taxpayer, domestic insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.592" offset="7558269">And under a law which provided that the franchise tax paid by domestic insurance companies shall be in lieu of a tax on a personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.451" offset="7597767">Now, as we understand the application and the rulings of this Court, it is that insofar as the admission of a foreign insurance company is concerned a state is not required to admit a foreign company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.290" offset="7665058">Furthermore, if it does admit a foreign company it may impose upon that admission any conditions which it seems fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.587" offset="7702256">It is only after the company has been admitted that it may not discriminate against that company in favor of local companies or in favor of someone else.</text>

            <text syncTime="2082.606" offset="8330344">Now, we submit that the difference in the taxation here is not such a difference as to be said to be a denial or a surrender of basic constitutional rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2122.183" offset="8488647">Now, it was mentioned that the effect of a ruling in favor of Reserve Life in this case would just be a session of the higher legislature and which they would raise a franchise tax law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2515.097" offset="10060382">That's true, with one minor exception, which I'd like to comment on in the close of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.338" offset="10097267">I would approach that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.581" offset="10106253">We have raised in our brief one question concerning the basic qualifications of this appellant to raise this question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.175" offset="10148676">No, I don't propose to go in to the history of this argument because this has been recited many times and I'm sure the Court is fully familiar with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.611" offset="10182426">The distinction I would like to make, this is the argument we made to the effect at this corporation is not a person within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.771" offset="10227043">Now first of all I want to say, we are not arguing that corporations are not persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.302" offset="10253166">And almost every case we would concede the corporations are persons but what we are saying is that a state creates an artificial being in the nature of a corporation that it endows this artificial being with certain rights and in almost every instance these rights are the same as the rights of persons and they are indistinguishable and therefore the Fourteenth Amendment does apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.463" offset="10361835">But on rare occasions, a state may endow a corporation with rates less than those of natural persons or with rates greater than those at natural persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.593" offset="10414289">In this situation, we think the Fourteenth Amendment may not be applied and I can best demonstrate this I think by analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.784" offset="10451069">If we were to take two materials and place some here and some here, and to tell you that each of these are white granular in form, each will melt when it's supposed to aflame, each will dissolve in water that each has the characteristic of participating out a saturated solution in the form of crystals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.581" offset="10534243">You might conclude that these are the same things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.927" offset="10547618">But then I would tell you that this one when dissolved in water will make the solutions sweet and this one will make the solution salty, you know immediately that they are not the same thing that one is sugar and one is salt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.308" offset="10597146">And the reason you know this is because you have recognized the characteristic, the things themselves appear entirely the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.387" offset="10637479">Well, in the State of Ohio, we have created and admitted a corporation which has been given all the rights of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.076" offset="10684291">It has the right to sue and the right to be sued, the right to contract and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.386" offset="10705502">But it has an addition to this, been given another rate, a second franchise and this had obtained not directly from the Secretary of State in the sense of each being a corporate charter but from the Director of the Department of Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.543" offset="10766106">And this was a right -- to right life insurance in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.602" offset="10786377">This right, the people of the State of Ohio as individuals do not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.049" offset="10812186">And what we're saying is that in the exercise of this peculiar right and only this right as distinguished from all of the other rights that it may have, it may not be a person entitled to claim the benefit of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.773" offset="10883030">We submit however that in the final analysis, the Court does not really have to reach at this point because we think this case is controlled by the argument which I have pointed out in connection with the Wheeling Steel Company case, and we submit that there is in essence no question which cannot be resolved on the basis of that case and that the decisions of the lower court should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.851" offset="11003402">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2755.766" offset="11023047">Mr. Chief Justice, other justices, I'll be very brief in my reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.331" offset="11049273">First, there was a reference to the fact that foreign companies may or may not own much real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.599" offset="11078322">I don't think the Court can decide constitutional questions on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.178" offset="11092637">In any event Reserve Life Insurance Company does own real estate in the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.081" offset="11120222">As far as the more important problems are concern, as I said in my initial presentation a state may make classifications and some discrepancy in taxes may occur because of those classifications, those are the common examples of utility companies or to some extent even insurance companies in Ohio airlines are taxed differently and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.379" offset="11233489">But the effect as I understand it of the Equal Protection Clause is that those differences must have some bearing on the matter being cons -- being classified and that certain differences are not allowable as classifications, their differences of rates (Inaudible) cannot make a different kind of classification, you cannot do it on -- similarly you cannot do it on questions of residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.098" offset="11332336">And this is what has been pointed out in the Wheeling Steel case that in that case everything was the same except for residence and that is no good as a classification.We maintain the same thing here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2846.238" offset="11384895">Well, suppose that in the -- suppose Ohio had a law, they had a law at that time provided generally that every foreign corporation that comes into the state to do business, every one of them must pay a little larger personal property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.272" offset="11469009">They do that and all they do is follow up our power to say that it is -- we -- how we want business done by corporate -- corporations in the state and the company had agreed to that when it came in, would you say that the Fourteenth Amendment would make that contract unconstitutional?</text>

            <text syncTime="2946.265" offset="11784986">It says, “The general principle --”, we'll let me skip that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3004.875" offset="12019461">One is under the commerce clause and there're several citations there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.731" offset="12038896">One is that in a certain case the state attempted to subject foreign corporations to the payment of a tax, not only on the property but property without the estate which violated the Due Process Clause and that could not be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.986" offset="12111935">And then finally, in the cases of a class to which is contented the present case belongs where tax are licensed law operates to deny them -- to deny to the foreign corporation the equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.480" offset="12161881">So specifically, it has been mentioned in the Hanover case that you cannot impose a violation of equal protection of the law at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.687" offset="12194691">I see that my time is up and I would conclude by stating that we think that this case is controlled by primarily the Wheeling Steel case also the Hanover case that this is a violation of Equal Protection Clause.</text>
