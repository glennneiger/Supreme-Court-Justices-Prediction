            <label>Mr. Richard A. Solomon</label>
            <text syncTime="5.775" offset="23092">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.589" offset="30302">As I made clear yesterday all of the gas purchases involved in this case like all of the other gas purchases that El Paso makes from producers or intermediate pipelines go into its regular system and are used primarily for sales in interstate commerce for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.312" offset="125179">The only sense in which these sales are restricted for intrastate or for internal use by El Paso is that, the contracts between El Paso and the sellers purport to saw a tribute to gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.559" offset="198217">And the majority of the Fifth Circuit below believed this process which they called contractual segregation was sufficient to remove these sales from the jurisdiction of this Commission but I think what we think is the correct law is summed up shortly and succinctly as probably as it could be done in the dissenting opinion of Judge Reeves.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.038" offset="308140">And I'm referring to page 376 of the short Volume 2 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.835" offset="339278">And what Judge Reeves said there was, whether gas is transported in interstate commerce, I'm reading from the first full paragraph on that page, whether gas is transported in the interstate commerce or is sold in interstate commerce for resale depends not on what the party say about the transaction but what is done with the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.033" offset="436036">This Court referring to the Fifth Circuit so held in Deep South Oil Company and its companion case Shell Oil Company, both of which were referred to on our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.257" offset="484937">In decisions of analogous question, the Supreme Court has continually disregarded contracts, which give a fictional construction to business transactions, and then he cites a series of cases, which we also discuss in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.346" offset="549303">As said in Connecticut Company versus the Power Commission, 324 U.S. 515 and 529, federal jurisdiction was to follow the flow of electric energy, and engineering, and scientific rather than a legalistic or governmental test.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.479" offset="637910">And I might just add that this language was used by this Court only last year in the Colton case.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.487" offset="685871">Now basically, this is our argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.458" offset="801750">-- is in engineering.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.191" offset="820663">There are number instances where this has been so held by the lower courts in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.369" offset="845427">This is really the first time to our knowledge where any lower court has held that this type of contractual segregation is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.410" offset="893597">For example, in the Deep -- in the Shell Oil case which I mentioned a second ago, their sale was made by producers in Texas to a Texas company which processed the gas, which was casinghead gas, to extract natural gasoline and other products and then sold what was left to another company which send it in to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.805" offset="1003207">And it was argued that that was both a local sale and that it was not a sale for resale since the contract provided that the purpose of this sale was for manufacturer at the second plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.943" offset="1055765">But the Fifth Circuit simply said that the legal determination of the question rests not on the parties' use of the word manufacture but upon the actual disposition of the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.488" offset="1109891">Now, Judge Reeves also said in the same opinion that careful consideration of the cases upon which the lower court relied and upon which my opponents here rely permit a finding -- none of them permit a finding of “nonjurisdictional” status solely on the language of the contract in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.892" offset="1199543">In addition to the language purporting to restrict the use of gas or electricity, there was also an actual flow of gas or electricity from the “nonjurisdictional” seller into the particular restricted use.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.144" offset="1256490">And with the brief time I have left, I'd like to discuss what I think are the two principal props for the lower court's opinion and why he was -- why it was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.955" offset="1307794">I think this whole device which was new with El Paso here and which is by no means something which was common in the gas industry up to this time of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.876" offset="1359412">I think this whole idea stems from some language that this Court included in the United States v. PUC of California at 345 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.152" offset="1412598">As the Court may remember, that case involved the sale of gas by the California Electric Company to the navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.183" offset="1444676">The navy took the power in California and transmitted over its lines into Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.623" offset="1474456">Most of that purchased by the navy was for its own users, but about 17% was used for resale to residents of a housing project.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.491" offset="1521894">Given these facts, the Court had no difficulty in saying that the entire transaction was jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.134" offset="1548434">And it brushed off with a single work unsubstantial, a claim that the sale was not jurisdictional because California Electric didn't intend to make sales for resale and hadn't so specified in its contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.121" offset="1608411">The Court said, and I'm quoting from page 316, “The concrete fact of resale of some portion of the electric energy transmitted from a state to a point outside thereof invokes federal jurisdiction at the outset.”</text>
            <text syncTime="419.312" offset="1677166">The problem comes from the language of the Court in the California case in which it suggested, which had left open the question, as to whether if California Electric had made two separate sales to the navy, one for resale and one for its own use, whether the latter sale could have been classified as juris -- as “nonjurisdictional”.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.391" offset="1809554">The Court citing its own opinion in the Penn Water case at 343 U.S. strongly implied that such a segregation would not have been available to split an interstate from an intrastate's dream of gas or power.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.734" offset="1902864">But it did question as to whether or not the problem might be as it said different with respect to splitting off such a stream between a purchaser's own use and the resale situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.664" offset="1982589">Now, I suggest that nothing in this Court's opinion supports the lower court decision here.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.861" offset="2011429">All the Court was suggesting was that on appropriate circumstances it might be possible for the sole supplier of a buyer as California electric of course was the sole supplier of the navy, to make two separate sales to that buyer, one of which would be jurisdictional and the other which would not be jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.243" offset="2124904">Thus, a pipeline at the end of its pipeline might take the gas which should had El Paso, it might take the gas which had -- had been transporting and make a sale -- make one sale to a city for a jurisdictional purpose and another sale to the same city for its own use.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.832" offset="2199301">The problem involved in the City of Hastings case which was referred to in the footnote in California and which is one of the other major cases relied on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.512" offset="2242038">But in such a situation of course when the pipeline says that the “nonjurisdictional” sale is a sale of my gas for use in your boiler fuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.039" offset="2296059">That is where the fuel for use in the boiler is coming from.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.449" offset="2313718">It's not coming from three or four other sellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.301" offset="2329182">We don't have a situation in where the “nonjurisdictional” contract merely claims to be providing this gas, it is providing this gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.676" offset="2378606">Now, the other primary prop in the lower court's opinion for this decision is the case in the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals called State of North Dakota against the Federal Power Commission, which is discussed at considerable length in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.562" offset="2474214">And which may possibly represent a peculiar situation in which it limited amount of segregation, if you want to use the word, is possible in the intrastate field.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.103" offset="2540356">The facts there were that the Montana-Dakota Pipeline was buying gas from one source in Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.746" offset="2590929">It was buying gas at the so-called Tioga Station.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.439" offset="2613708">All of its gas came from there.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.580" offset="2622276">The gas actually previously was 85% from Amerada and 15% from Cigna.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.191" offset="2652682">But all the gas they purchased was at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.243" offset="2664908">They bought it under two contracts; one of which was admittedly for intrasta – interstate, and the other of which was restricted for intrastate deals.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.165" offset="2716630">Most of the intrastate gas actually went over a separate line which didn't get out of the state at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.308" offset="2745156">But some of the intrastate gas traveled along with the interstate gas in a line which extended into Wyoming and was siphoned off before it got to Wyoming into four small North Dakota communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.743" offset="2822896">And the Court, the Eight Circuit held in that case that those sales were intrastate commerce because they were made in the State of North Dakota and never got outside of the State of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.463" offset="2889770">Well, it's perfectly clear I think from my recital of the facts that the reason that they were able to do so was that you didn't have between the Tioga plant and the four laterals to these North Dakota communities intervening parties coming in and bringing gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.699" offset="2994782">So that it was fair to say, that all of the gas sold at the Tioga plant for intrastate sale and no other gas was the gas that got into these four laterals.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.012" offset="3059984">The problem, I suggest, would be analogous to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.833" offset="3079314">If instead of the complex arrangements we had, we had only the two Lo-Vaca contracts and the “nonjurisdictional” one was limited to the gas used at the Coquat station and a route to Sonora.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.109" offset="3140336">In other words, it was gas which had to be from Lo-Vaca because there was no other gas coming in to the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.562" offset="3170220">That would be the North Dakota case presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.010" offset="3200000">And since that's the case, we don't have to get in to the separate problem of whether or not the North Dakota case is right or not since it again depends on what this Court in California said it was probably not possible segregation of intrastate and interstate gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.934" offset="3275651">Now finally, let me just say a word about what's not in this case, although you might be told it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.440" offset="3313685">And I'm referring now to so-called direct sales contracts where a producer sells to an industry or utility in a different state and the buyer picks up the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.207" offset="3384738">But because he can't use it in Texas or Louisiana, he transfers it to a pipeline and the pipeline, in turn, retransfers an equivalent amount of gas at the other end of the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.376" offset="3441476">Or transportation agreements as such whereby a shippers and if they gives a pipeline gas and the pipeline gives him an equivalent amount of gas at the other end of the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.167" offset="3500617">Now, the Commission in this very case may express that it was not holding those types of transactions jurisdictional, and it has never held either type of transaction jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.074" offset="3564251">It does have and I would -- do not deny it, a proceeding pending before, at the present moment, undecided looking into the question of transportation agreements, because there are questions as to whether or not how they should be treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.362" offset="3625378">But it hasn't done anything of this nature so far and contrary to what you may hear, a decision here does not necessarily decide those other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.129" offset="3672503">And the reason for that is very simple in my opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.021" offset="3688072">There's a separate serious question involved in calling direct sales or transportation agreements, sales for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.630" offset="3726420">And they are the question which has not been resolved as to whether there's any sales relationship involving the pipeline in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.773" offset="3759020">If there is and maybe there are very well might be, but if there is, we might have this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.526" offset="3778038">But whether there is or not, has never been determined.</text>

            <text syncTime="1093.925" offset="4375615">We feel that the gap that would be created in this situation by giving effect to this contractual segregation was a serious one and it's -- it's a special interest to California because we consume nearly 80% of El Paso's gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.763" offset="4430994">And if the device tested here proves successful, some 7% or 8% of the gas purchased under FPC controlled prices by El Paso could escape that control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.267" offset="4485016">The gas would become more costly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.787" offset="4495047">This additional cost within large part be ultimately carried by the California consumer, and with the elimination of FPC control over these price of these contractually segregated sales, and with no control possible by the California Commission over these sales, what protection is left for the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.016" offset="4579997">It's not fair and it's not reasonable to expect that Texas, even if it could legally act, would regulate these prices so as to reduce Texas income and provide California consumers with a saving of the expense of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.521" offset="4637989">The Natural Gas Act is designed to provide some comprehensive and effective regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.752" offset="4658991">It doesn't contemplate ineffective regulation or a gap on either the State or the federal level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.012" offset="4679993">We suggest that this is not the place to apply a legal fiction and depart from an interpretation of the Act according to its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.772" offset="4714998">As a matter of physical fact, the sales do fall within the language of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1200.260" offset="4800993">In light of the background that I've given, it would appear that only the most extra ordinary and compelling extrinsic policy considerations would just apply a plain, a legal fiction, so as to reach a result that's contrary both to the literal language and we believe to the policy of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.795" offset="4871105">Are there any such unique and extraordinary reasons here such overwriting policy considerations which would lead, tend to support respondents position?</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.090" offset="4908304">We can look at some of the readings, it would have been suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.317" offset="4921260">The respondents placed great weight in their written statements of intent -- of intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.174" offset="4944666">These solemn and ritualistic recitals careful and precise recitals of intent to perform an Act that admittedly can't be physically performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.539" offset="4982073">And indeed, this was one of the things urged in support of their position but the fact the act is physically impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.103" offset="5012376">The recitals then are simply self-serving declarations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.306" offset="5029198">The lower court suggested another point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.836" offset="5035259">It said that fictitious segregation might be required in order to avoid construction of unnecessary duplicate pipelines, lines that might otherwise be constructed so that Houston and Lo-Vaca could directly serve the source where the gas was to be consumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.768" offset="5102968">This seems to us somewhat unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.174" offset="5112686">FPC jurisdiction may appear on the pleasant but the economic facts of business lie for such that it would seem federal jurisdiction would be preferable to the construction of new and separate pipelines across Texas, New Mexico and Arizona simply to provide fuel for El Paso's compressors and other facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.304" offset="5189172">We feel that worry about that kind of duplicate construction is just sheer speculation about an unlikely alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.586" offset="5222296">It's not sheer speculation, however, to be concerned about unnecessary construction such as proposed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.517" offset="5249985">In order to make the ferry hold water, it's necessary to put in additional valves, construct a 16-inch pipelines to the expense of millions of dollars also that it can be set with a straight phase that it's theoretically possible for one molecule of Houston or Lo-Vaca gas to reach the place where it's supposed to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.851" offset="5327308">Although everyone agree that only a tiny portion of that gas would ever reach the destination where it's supposed to be consumed under the recitals in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.447" offset="5369731">Another point has been mentioned is that, I don't say this is directly urged but to some extent it is in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.532" offset="5398047">It appears that the gas obtained under these contracts might not be offered for sale by the producers or the gatherers unless the transactions are insulated from FPC jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.149" offset="5440575">One might argue from this that FPC jurisdiction should be curtailed to enable El Paso to get gas that otherwise would not be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.379" offset="5473489">We feel it unnecessary to elaborate on the objections to that type of a consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.881" offset="5499507">It might be helpful in understanding El Paso's motivations but this could hardly serve as the basis for a judicial decision surrendering federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.412" offset="5541616">Again, the Commission's factual analysis at the flow of gas is criticized by the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.479" offset="5573904">The respondents describe it in this way as the molecular identification theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.655" offset="5598563">And actually what they're talking about is the Commission's effort to find out what gas actually flows where.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.796" offset="5627089">And it said that this concern of the Commission where the actual flow of gas, now I used the words from respondent's brief runs counter to the whole stream of law governing commercial practices involving fungible commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.053" offset="5692186">There are other general allegations in respondent's brief with respect to the law of fungibles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.838" offset="5711308">And I would like to take a few moments just to discuss in general about that law and see its application if any to the facts before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.166" offset="5744640">The term fungible is used by respondents as though it's a meaningful and significant legal description that would be helpful in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.409" offset="5777554">But it doesn't appear that fungible has a significant legal meaning in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.244" offset="5800960">The law of fungibles developed largely in cases of which the grain elevators are perhaps the typical ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.423" offset="5825620">The question usually comes before the Court where there's been an unexpected development, a disaster of some sort either a physical disaster, fire, or flood, or a financial disaster wiping out the grain elevator proprietor, something about nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.183" offset="5880686">The goods -- something has happened so that it's necessary to determine the interest, the ownerships of different people, perhaps a buyer, a seller, a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.897" offset="5915585">The question is to whether or not, there was a lien on property where their title had passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.469" offset="5933871">The loss from the disaster must be allocated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.409" offset="5945574">Fungibility as applied by the courts in this context is nothing more than a device sometimes artificial perhaps to determine the intent of the parties that is not otherwise expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.544" offset="5990087">The intent of the party is clear, there is no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.566" offset="5998237">The man who out his grain on the grain elevator if he intended to become a co-owner, he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.019" offset="6020075">He can pledge his interest in the undivided mask to the bank, the bank can have a lien on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.071" offset="6044212">But if there's no expression of intent and this is where fungibility becomes important, the courts where the goods are homogenous have supplied an intent, an intent on the part of the parties to actually become co-owners of the undivided indivisible mask of commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.322" offset="6117251">The device as they say is artificial under these circumstances but it's not totally fictitious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.336" offset="6149329">And it's fair and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.516" offset="6154031">There is no great public policy involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.922" offset="6163644">The object is to reach justice between the parties and to have a workable rule that fits into the practices of the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.423" offset="6189662">Other cases discuss fungibility in connection with confusion of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.579" offset="6206276">Those cases are low interesting because some of them suggest that one who voluntarily puts his commodity into a mask where it can't be distinguished from other commodities in the same mask can't profit from such voluntary commingling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.812" offset="6259148">And indeed, tortuous confusion of goods may lead to one who does it to lose the title to what he did own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.527" offset="6286106">And as we know in community property, states her husband to get things confused may find that he can't segregate his separate property, he no longer holds it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.485" offset="6321842">We feel that this doesn't have any direct bearing on the case but it illustrates that fungibility as an abstract concept doesn't get us anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.892" offset="6363533">Our case is not a dispute between private parties where the intent of the parties is an important thing to define in order to achieve justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.262" offset="6401045">The intent that's important here is the intent of Congress in the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.600" offset="6426331">It will also be noted that there is more make believe involved here than in the grain elevator cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.197" offset="6448692">There, an intent is artificially supplied where there's fungibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.714" offset="6466769">But the intent that is assumed on the basis of fungibility, is an intent to do something that is physically, logically, and legally possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.052" offset="6504176">That's to become a co-owner in a mass of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.682" offset="6518700">That can be contrasted with this case where the intent is expressed by one owner with respect to all of his goods that he's going to make a separate use that admittedly is physically impossible of a commodity that he is willfully commingle with other commodities in an undistinguishable mask.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.464" offset="6585783">This intent is recited of course for one purpose only, to escape regulation over a sale gas, a sale which admittedly is physically within the terms of the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.332" offset="6633326">We don't feel then that the general case is talking about fungibility are important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.127" offset="6652447">There had been regulatory decisions which have referred to fungibility and have applied a rule involving the Natural Gas Act that do depart from molecular identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.945" offset="6707722">They have cut out a federal jurisdiction gas that cannot be molecularly distinguished from other gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.735" offset="6742936">And these cases were referred to by Mr. Solomon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.302" offset="6757146">I won't discuss them in detail other than to say that they are different from our case in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.240" offset="6792882">First and most important practical difference is the regulatory impact in both the Hastings case and the North Dakota case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.315" offset="6833215">This Court said that the Federal Power Commission lack jurisdiction over an intrastate transaction that was segregated, although molecularly you could not tell the difference in the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.012" offset="6883997">But the result in both of those cases was to lead regulatory control in the Commission, in the state where the consumer who needed the protection resided that consumer could then look as he should look to his own state to protect his interest and to his regulatory commission to see that he had a fair treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.357" offset="6969365">That of course is to be contrasted with this case as I explained at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.842" offset="6987337">Furthermore, there is a larger element of fiction involved with respect to the fungibility question in this case than in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.121" offset="7028402">In those cases, there is no question that the gas that went to the “nonjurisdictional” source and was in fact the gas of the seller that was a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.034" offset="7076049">The gas went to the “nonjurisdictional” source and it went to a jurisdictional course -- purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.171" offset="7100604">But all of the gas was a seller's gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.858" offset="7111367">The fiction that was applied in those cases was to depart from a strict molecule pursuit and say that under those facts, in the North Dakota, there was a tailgate of a plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.498" offset="7169985">Some of the gas served communities in North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.373" offset="7181479">Others -- other of the same stream of gas left the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.927" offset="7195690">At the time of sale, it's true, you couldn't tell which molecules were going to go where.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.611" offset="7214393">But there's no question that the tailgate of this plant, all of the gas was bought from one source by one gas company and there's no question that those intrastate “nonjurisdictional” deliveries were deliveries of the same gas that we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.566" offset="7274162">We just couldn't be sure which molecule went which way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.889" offset="7287536">Whereas in this case, we know that 90% to 95% of the gas, which according to the contractual recitals, is to serve a certain purpose, it's never going to get there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.084" offset="7320242">It's commingled in the stream where it has a very tiny proportion of the total stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.804" offset="7339154">And I would just like to say in closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.584" offset="7350335">And we respectfully urge the Court not to reduce the protection which is presently enjoyed by the consumer under the Natural Gas Act as interpreted by this Court in the Phillips decision in 1954.</text>

            <text syncTime="1872.167" offset="7488575">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, the Southern California Gas Company and the Southern Counties Gas Company of California are gas public utility distributing companies in Central and Southern California serving approximately 9 to 10 million people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.179" offset="7572689">We purchase some 75% to 80% of our gas supply from out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.343" offset="7601319">We received that at the California border principally from El Paso Natural Gas Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.818" offset="7631203">We are taking at the border daily from El Paso approximately 1,300,000,000 cubic feet of gas per day which is the substantial flow of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.748" offset="7678955">Our neighbor utility to the north, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company also a California public utility pays approximately the same amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.985" offset="7715840">The fact is that 80% of El Paso's gas is sold to the California market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.982" offset="7743843">That 90% of its jurisdictional gas is sold in the California market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.787" offset="7767144">Section 1 (b) here in question, provides when you have a sale or resale interstate commerce, the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission shall attach, and it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.263" offset="7816986">In the Deep South case, the Fifth Circuit pointed out that as a practical matter and that this was brought to the attention of the Congress when they had it in mind in Section 1 (b) that the price which a public utility distributing company can charge his costumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.935" offset="7883651">Or the low-price, he can charge these customers are dependent in large part in turn upon what it must pay the interstate pipeline company providing its gas supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.112" offset="7928372">The price we pay for gas at the border is set by the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.597" offset="7950315">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.291" offset="7953136">Because as in Section 1 (b) and as this Court said in that FPC v. Natural Gas Pipeline Company, when you sell gas in one state and transport it and deliver it to a distributing company in another state, that is interstate commerce or resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.487" offset="8021891">The fact is here that the Houston Lo-Vaca Gas would be the gas sold in the State of Texas and would in substantial part be transported and delivered to the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.566" offset="8074240">This has been conceded throughout this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.626" offset="8086465">The parties so testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.196" offset="8092735">The president of Houston Pipeline Company acknowledged it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.038" offset="8104124">The chief pipeline engineer of El Paso acknowledged it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.610" offset="8118439">No one said otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.163" offset="8124604">The examiners so found, the Federal Power Commission so found, the majority opinion in the Fifth Circuit so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.874" offset="8147487">In fact, the gas flows to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.435" offset="8161698">Why then can we device some way of avoiding that jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.916" offset="8191582">What justifies it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2112.902" offset="8451553">Let me deal with the concept before we get to the actual facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.790" offset="8471092">The Section 1 (b) has two requirements in order to have a sale for resale interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.954" offset="8499722">Number one, you must have the actual sale itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.590" offset="8514351">Number two, you must have a natural gas company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.415" offset="8529607">The natural gas company is defined as the person making the sale for resale in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.808" offset="8559177">I think it's important to bear those two things in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.200" offset="8568790">Now, there's been much talk of commi -- commingling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.091" offset="8580284">Now, what does commingling mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.430" offset="8585718">How does it affect this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.227" offset="8592823">And I think that we have failed to express properly what we mean by commingling and how it affects this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.118" offset="8620408">I think we feel on the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.235" offset="8628872">I hope we don't make that mistake here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.750" offset="8638903">Let me give you this example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.025" offset="8648098">Part of the gas of Houston Pipeline Company theoretically is to be sold to the Phillips Goldsmith Plant in the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.826" offset="8683207">Now, let's change the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.565" offset="8694178">Let's assume that that part is still true, but that you have an interstate pipeline company into Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.869" offset="8719464">It stops there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.692" offset="8722704">It does not go beyond Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.398" offset="8733571">Let's speed into that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.306" offset="8741198">Commingle if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.253" offset="8748931">There's Houston Pipeline Company gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.770" offset="8763037">Let's do it before it can get to that Phillips Goldsmith Plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.501" offset="8777979">Now, is that Houston Pipeline Gas, gas flowed in the interstate commerce for resale because of the commingling?</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.206" offset="8808803">Obviously not, the gas never left the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.072" offset="8824268">It couldn't possibly leave the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.325" offset="8829283">There's no possible basis for FPC jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.175" offset="8844643">So if it's not commingling that really we're talking about, we're talking about the flow of the gas to California for resale as part of a commingled supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.685" offset="8882678">That's which is the Federal Power Commission jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.453" offset="8897724">Now, let me give you another simple example on the other side of the case perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.585" offset="8922279">Let's start out with El Paso and let's assume that if Three Rivers, Texas where this new line is to start.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.777" offset="8955089">You -- you have El Paso Natural Gas Company and let's assume that all its gas is going to flow in interstate commerce for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.567" offset="8994168">Let's assume that Lo-Vaca now provides a certain portion of gas and that theoretically, this is to be sold let's say to a -- or a cement plant in the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.981" offset="9043905">I submit to you that that gas from Lo-Vaca just as much as the El Paso gas flows to California for resale in substantial part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.063" offset="9084238">And that accordingly the jurisdiction of Federal Power Commission must impose a tax so long as it flows in that interstate pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.031" offset="9120078">Now, you reached a point when that jurisdiction ceases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.866" offset="9135438">And where is that point?</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.690" offset="9142753">That point is when you had your lateral going off the interstate pipeline to the cement plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.532" offset="9166054">This is the Panhandle Eastern case in 372 U.S. 305.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.178" offset="9188624">Remember that in that case the question was, “Does the State of Indiana have jurisdiction over this industrial sale?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.485" offset="9225927">This Court held that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.604" offset="9234390">That despite the fact that the Federal Power Commission had certified the facilities and they pointed that there is cooperation if you will between the State and federal jurisdiction that this is your comprehensive regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.125" offset="9296457">It pointed out that on the very FPC certificate that the FPC has referred to the Indiana statute and said nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.421" offset="9325610">It was doing, it was meant to interfere with the jurisdiction of Indiana over the industrial sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.477" offset="9349851">Now let me apply these concepts, if I will, to this record I've asked you to turn to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.452" offset="9369704">You will note that this new pipeline of 227 miles from Sonora South to Three Rivers is to obtain access to South Texas supply as Mr. Solomon told you about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.794" offset="9423099">Let's just look at ban over that pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.023" offset="9436056">That's a 30-inch pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.267" offset="9445042">It's bigger on the existing pipeline of El Paso stopping at Sonora which is the most southern part of the El Paso system which is a 20-inch line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.436" offset="9481718">Now, that 227-mile line, 30 inches diameter which can take what, 500, 600 million cubic feet a gas per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.805" offset="9515154">That's not going down there to bring fuel to El Paso plant all through Texas hundreds of miles apart and then lead to Arizona and New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.313" offset="9561234">That's going down there to get new sources of supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.675" offset="9574609">There has been no question about that in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.854" offset="9587357">Let's bear this in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.075" offset="9596238">Lo-Vaca has two separate contracts, one which is so-called jurisdictional now which is conceded the Federal Power has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.172" offset="9628630">The other which they say that no jurisdiction because of this clause that is going to be use in Arizona and New Mexico, this impossible clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.138" offset="9664470">That gas will commingle before it ever reaches that new pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.493" offset="9685891">Even Lo-Vaca's jurisdictional and “nonjurisdictional class” will commingle before it reaches the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.471" offset="9717864">There it will commingle in turn with the Houston gas which is theoretically “nonjurisdictional”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.325" offset="9741270">All along the line, gas will flow in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.851" offset="9755376">You can never segregate that out and that's why the gas ultimately reaches California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.169" offset="9772617">That's why Houston Lo-Vaca gas gets there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.278" offset="9785051">To maintain this theory that the gas physically could reach compressor plants, you might take a look up there from the northeastern part of the map, you can see a place called Fullerton --</text>

            <text syncTime="2511.001" offset="10043977">Not only does it need it, Fullerton provides its own gas supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.609" offset="10062367">In addition, you notice there's a 16-inch line going directly west from Fullerton, it supplies gas itself to the general El Paso system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.269" offset="10097058">It doesn't need any gas for compressor use at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.916" offset="10115657">This is true of many of these facilities, which are sought to be built.</text>

            <text syncTime="2540.764" offset="10162991">It's just where everything seems to come together there we have those pipelines in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.067" offset="10196219">At the present time, there's no way at all that any gas of Houston Lo-Vaca can get to these compressor stations in West Texas without going into New Mexico commingling with New Mexico gas then coming back into the State of Texas, no way at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.856" offset="10267376">So they say, “Alright, in order to help this fiction out we'll build a pipeline, a 210-mile pipeline.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.924" offset="10295693">So that theoretically part of the Houston Lo-Vaca gas would then go through that 16-inch pipeline and serve the compressor plants there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.815" offset="10335190">Well, in truth and in fact, it does not happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.783" offset="10347102">The testimony in these case is, that part of the Houston Lo-Vaca gas will flow through that pipeline, that part of that Houston Lo-Vaca gas is going to flow up through Fullerton station which we were talking about over to Unison New Mexico and then down from Unison New Mexico back to Pickles River station back into Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.316" offset="10425260">The testimony is that part of the Houston Lo-Vaca gas is going to go through those pipelines just west of Keystone station into the State of New Mexico then going back into Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2648.700" offset="10594743">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.713" offset="10618776">For 25 years, Section 1 (b) of Natural Gas Act has been interpreted by the Commission and by the courts including this Court as permitting parties to enter into transactions treating their gas as a fungible commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.715" offset="10718772">Now, according to the Commission, this is no longer possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.036" offset="10744059">And if Lo-Vaca or Houston enter into a contract with El Paso for El Paso's own use in his compressor stations or for El Paso's or for use in intrastate commerce, that sale in itself is defeated if El Paso commingles the gas received from Lo-Vaca and Houston with other gas which is bought for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.814" offset="10891180">The question then it seems is, does Section 1 (b) deny the fungibility of natural gas or more fundamental – mentally?</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.044" offset="10948127">Does it deny the power of parties in the first instance to set their relationships by contract whether it'd be a restricted use sale or whether it'd be in a bailment in the transportation or a bailment in the storage project where there is joint storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.569" offset="11042273">The cases which have interpreted the Commission's power under Section 7 -- under Section 1 (b) have uniformly held that the parties themselves established that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.800" offset="11107161">And they established it using the standard commercial concept that gas is a fungible commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.418" offset="11137672">And when gas is a fungible commodity, they may and do sell by volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.953" offset="11163794">For a -- a seller of gas is like a seller of grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.805" offset="11191171">When a farmer puts 50,000 bushels of wheat into an elevator and later sells that wheat to the mill, he doesn't sell the same grains to be put in, he sells by volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.554" offset="11262119">He puts in 50,000 bushels and he takes out 50,000 bushels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.557" offset="11286152">In the grain elevator case, perhaps none of the same 50,000 bushels that he put in is any longer in the elevator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.545" offset="11330142">That is not this case here, however, to the extent that the gas which we put in will flow continuously downstream to the points of use but we sell by volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.936" offset="11399732">Gas like grain, or oil, or coal in each unit is indistinguishable and interchangeable, so that the mo -- molecule has no separate and independent legal significance and parties sell by volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.869" offset="11499416">They enter into and make their contractual commitment by volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.440" offset="11521672">And there can be no doubt that in the absence of the Natural Gas Act, the parties could and would make this type of a transaction, it would be a restricted use transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.502" offset="11590008">The question is, does the Section 1 (b) of the Natural Gas Act which describes a type of a transaction which the Commission has jurisdiction over give the Commission power to determine the -- what kind of transaction parties may enter into?</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.172" offset="11684676">We will approach this problem by reference to the several cases involving your Section 1 (b) of the Natural Gas Act or 301 (b) -- 301 (b) of the Power Act which is in this respect substantially similar.</text>

            <text syncTime="3141.038" offset="12564062">Finally, in -- in ending our -- our argument we would like to -- to go into the question of -- of what power the Commission does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.601" offset="12606380">In very real power, the Commission does have over many aspects of these proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.838" offset="12631249">It is not a question of regulation or no regulation as we should show.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.867" offset="12663432">I think that the starting point for discussion of the -- the fungibility doctrine is the case of United States versus California at 345 U.S. which was discussed earlier this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.475" offset="12745874">In that proceeding, the California Electric Company was making a single sale of electric energy to the navy, to the navy in California, which the navy would carry across the state line into Nevada and devote a portion -- a large portion to its own use and a smaller portion for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.454" offset="12849737">California -- the State of California and the California Company argued that at least that portion of the energy, which was used by the navy for its own use in another state similar to the type of a transaction of Lo-Vaca in -- in the sense that it was a sale in one state for use in another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.228" offset="12956839">California argued that that portion of the sale was subject to its jurisdiction because it was not a jurisdictional sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.289" offset="13005113">This Court held that the sale, since it included admittedly energy being sold for resale, was subject to Commission re -- Federal Power Commission regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.497" offset="13061956">The very terms which would control the sale for the navy's own use would be regulated by the Federal Power Commission and the Federal Power Commission's regulation as a necessary incident covered the sale to the navy for its own use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.937" offset="13143667">But in -- in making that decision, the Court was at pains to point out that if the parties had entered into a separate transaction in terms of separate rates, separate negotiations, separate contracts, separate middling, the indicia of a separate transaction, then what was admittedly “nonjurisdictional” because it is a sale for resale -- sale for the purchaser's own consumption would not be subject to a Federal Power Commission jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.499" offset="13321927">But note, it did not say that that sale was converted necessarily into a sale for resale because of later commingling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.628" offset="13382426">Commingling in none of the cases has any effect upon the type of transaction, which is entered into because gas or electricity is a fungible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.680" offset="13450658">And the intermingling makes no legal difference to the type of a contract and it is the -- it is the sale itself as the Court said in the California case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.221" offset="13488797">It is the sale itself, which fixes the limits of jurisdictional grant not the use of the -- not the intermingling of the gas by the purchaser but the sale itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.719" offset="13586808">In the California case, the Court, I submit, was recognizing what this Court had also recognized in the well-known case of United Gas Pipeline Corporation versus Mobile Gas Service Corporation, which is it appears that 332 U.S. or 350 U.S. 332.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.789" offset="13715122">In that proceeding, the Court will recall the question involved whether the Commission had jurisdiction to entertain a unilateral rate increase filing of a sale which is admittedly subject to Commission's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.750" offset="13794952">And the Court said in reversing the Commission, said that that -- the Commission did not have jurisdiction to consider unilateral filing because there was no contract between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.323" offset="13857228">And it started from the fundamental basis that it is the parties themselves that fix the relationships between themselves by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.217" offset="13924833">And when they have fix that relationship, it is then brought to the Commission, and if -- if it is a jurisdictional relationship, the Commission may review it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.282" offset="13965061">The Commission may review it under Section 4 or 5 or may review it under Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.486" offset="13993900">But if it is not a jurisdictional relationship, the Commission cannot because of its jurisdiction over sales for resale convert what the parties have made to be a sale for purchaser's own use into a sale for resale, contrary to the standard commercial concept fungible -- dealing with fungible commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.408" offset="14121587">The Court in California recognized that this case with the same theory was coming again before the Commission, was then before the Commission in case which became the Hastings case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.930" offset="14187624">In the Hastings case, the seller sold gas at the city gate in the interstate commerce under two contracts, a portion that the -- or sold under one contract was for the city's own use for boiler fuel since it was the sale in the interstate commerce to the purchaser's own consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.129" offset="14288457">It was not jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.108" offset="14300369">The other sale for resale, general resale, was jurisdictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.430" offset="14325656">But note that the city commingled the volumes so that the molecules themselves were just as much lost in that case as in the Lo-Vaca's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.023" offset="14392007">A molecule of gas sold under the sale to the city for its own use might well end up and because of commingling, it did end up being reso -- going to the point of resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.849" offset="14459298">And a molecule sold under the resale contract would end up at the point of the boiler fuel plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.300" offset="14497123">But because gas is a fungible commodity, they sold by volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.825" offset="14519275">They didn't sell the individual the -- the fact that they sold gas did not mean that there was any legal significance to the separate identity of indistinguishable molecules of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.022" offset="14596075">So too in North Dakota which I would like to point out involved not just one source of gas but involved two sellers under four contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.742" offset="14654903">Each seller had interstate resale contracts and each seller had intrastate resale contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.860" offset="14699416">And by far, the smaller amount was being sold for resale in intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.626" offset="14734420">The figures have stick in my mind where about six-and-a-half million Mcf delivered from the plant under all of the contracts and about 11,000 delivered under two contracts for resale within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.789" offset="14807144">The point is that 15% of the 11,000 was attributed to Signal but you could not go back and trace that 15% to Signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.473" offset="14885825">It may very well and probably did come from Amerada and may very well and probably did by mol -- molecules coming from Amerada's sale for general use in Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.716" offset="14950818">So that what those cases hold is that commingling makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.647" offset="14998570">That the -- you do not trace molecules for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.504" offset="15021976">It's a sale of volumes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.514" offset="15033992">Now, the North Dakota case has an interesting sequel recently decided by the same court with the same parties, same buyer, and same sellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.064" offset="15092193">Where all the sellers intended to do was to add more gas to go to the North Dakota intrastate use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.620" offset="15154469">You would think that the same theory would apply, that commingling would make no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.655" offset="15182576">The Commission, however, held on another show cost that those sales which had been sales in intrastate commerce were converted into sales in interstate commerce not for anything that the parties themselves did in fixing the relationship between them, but because of the presence of gas put into the commingled stream from a third source.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.003" offset="15319980">We submit that the fact of a third source obviously can have no difference as the court in the Eight Circuit held in reversing the Commission for it is not the tracing of the molecules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.776" offset="15387063">In -- in the original North Dakota case and in the Amerada case, the molecules sold by Amerada or sold by Signal for use within the state at the point of sale might very well go to Montana and be resold to the same extend that a molecule sold by Houston to El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.845" offset="15515376">Because of commingling, it might reach a point of resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.519" offset="15542021">But the parties entered into a type of -- of contractual arrangement which the Commission then looked at - and if that arrangement described a sale for resale, it had jurisdiction, if it does not under Section 1 (b), it does not have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.229" offset="15640869">Perhaps the major fallacy of the Commission's new position here is -- is most graphically demonstrated in the transportation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.544" offset="15754136">It is correct that the Commission here held in its opinion in this case that it did not intend to disturb transportation arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.933" offset="15799693">We submit that if it does not intend to disturb transportation arrangements when it admits that a producer selling say in -- let's use the case of Federal Power Commission versus Transcontinental which is set in our brief, it was a Supreme Court case a couple of years ago, as an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.123" offset="15892480">Their producers sold to Consolidated Edison of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.324" offset="15917244">Consolidated Edison delivered the gas to Transcontinental for transportation to New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.692" offset="15950681">Transcontinental commingled that gas with other gas purchased from many other sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="3997.916" offset="15991641">So that the molecule delivered by Con-Ed would might very well reach a point of resold to be replaced by an identical molecule for kind of its own use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.156" offset="16060604">The Commission in its opinion here said it does not intend to disturb that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.810" offset="16091220">If it does not intend to disturb that relationship, it is clear that it is because fungibility is a living and vital force which af -- is determines the type of transaction they enter into.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.338" offset="16161332">If it is not, they haven't entered into that type of a transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.112" offset="16180349">To the same extent, if fungibility determines the type of transaction the parties have entered into, the parties here have entered into sales for El Paso's own use or sales in intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.212" offset="16252761">There can be no doubt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.127" offset="16264464">On the other hand, if as suggested by counsel, in -- the Commission counsel in its brief, fungibility is to be denied, then the delivery of the -- for transportation purposes is converted according to the theory into really three sales, into a sale by the producer to Con-Ed for resale, into a sale by Con-Ed to Transcontinental for resale, and a sale by Transcontinental to Con-Ed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.981" offset="16475847">This Court recognized in the Transcontinental case when it discussed the Commission's certificate power over transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4128.859" offset="16515344">It recognized that the producer's sale was “nonjurisdictional” because it was a sale to Con-Ed for its own use.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.526" offset="16558080">But the Commission's theory would convert that bailment type of a transaction into several different sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.930" offset="16623700">It is our position that Section 1 (b) does not give the Commission authority to convert what the parties established in the first instance into a different type of transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.979" offset="16687856">I'm filing a brief before the Commission tomorrow in another proceeding involving storage of natural gas where two companies store gas together.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.203" offset="16732787">And one access operator from the other, one being a completely intrastate company putting its gas in retaining title, pulling it out, the other being an interstate company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.915" offset="16783569">The Commission stopped based upon the Commission's opinion here in Lo-Vaca is saying that that is not a bailment, it is a sale for resale when the intrastate company puts it gas into the storage field and commingles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4218.430" offset="16873639">Section 1 (b) simply does not give the Commission the authority to determine the type of transaction, the type of transaction determines jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.661" offset="16950544">I would like to turn next to the argument on regulatory gap on whether recognition of fungibility just I submit recognized in all of the cases we have discussed and I have discussed it so far, whether that creates a regulatory gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="4262.199" offset="17048764">First, I think it would be wise to go back and determine what is the so-called regulatory gap that the Natural Gas Act was intended to fill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.596" offset="17102367">The Natural Gas Act, passed in 1938, was intended to cover only one type of transaction in interstate commerce, which was beyond the power of the states to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.058" offset="17172167">And that type of transaction as determined by the decisions at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.369" offset="17197453">It was at that time a drawing of what had been considered national and local interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.823" offset="17235278">And the Act itself now draws the distinction between national and local interest giving the Commission authority over sales in interstate commerce for resale but no other type of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.159" offset="17312601">It seems that this was clearly defined in -- in the Panhandle versus Indiana case in 332 U.S. and again discussed just last term in Federal Power Commission versus Southern California Edison case, where a contention was made by California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.395" offset="17417509">As I understand their contention here in somewhat adverse form that in that case, in the California Edison case, contention was made that even though it was a sale for resale in the interstate commerce, it was a local character and therefore beyond the Federal Power Commission jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.913" offset="17503608">This Court disagreed and said that the Act had drawn a bright line.</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.399" offset="17529522">Sales for resale are subject to Commission jurisdiction, any other type of sale for whatever purpose are not subject to Commission jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.127" offset="17572467">So too here, if this is not a sale for resale if the parties have not entered into a sale for resale, there is no regulatory gap by reason of the fact they've entered into a sale for the purchaser's own consumption in the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.059" offset="17676225">The Act was intended that such sales would not be subject to Federal Power Commission of jurisdiction, neither does the Act give the Commission jurisdiction based upon effect of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.527" offset="17798060">The fact that a 4% of a particular pipeline or overall the pipelines may be used for “nonjurisdictional” purpose does not mean that those sales are converted into sales for resale in interstate commerce, and that is the only test.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.819" offset="17899207">The affect can be seen, it seems to me, just as clearly by the suggestion that if parties constructed their own separate line to these points of views, the sales to El Paso would not be subject as counsel have admitted to Commission jurisdiction for there would not be sales in the interstate commerce for resale, yet they would affect El Paso just as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.697" offset="18062733">If Lo-Vaca or Houston were to sale oil for this compressor fuel, it would affect El Paso just as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.823" offset="18103275">But the Commission would not have jurisdiction over that sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.675" offset="18118635">The Commission simply does not have jurisdiction because of what it feels may be the affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4539.568" offset="18158237">But we do not wish to leave this with the Court with the feeling that these transactions in their entirety are without regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4553.875" offset="18215497">For quite the contrary is true and the Commission has full power given to it under the Act to control these transactions in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4569.180" offset="18276624">Let's look first at Lo-Vaca.</text>
            <text syncTime="4571.940" offset="18287700">Lo-Vaca buys gas from producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4576.470" offset="18305776">Those producer sales are 18 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4580.257" offset="18320927">18 cents happen to be the price the comm -- at that time the Commission had stated in its guideline policy statement that it would accept producers sales in that area and issue certificates without hearing so long as there was no intervention so that those prices were the guideline price at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.058" offset="18428134">In any event, regardless of whether the Commission changed its view and might come to a lower rate now, those rates would be subject to the Commission's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.492" offset="18477871">And the Commission would regulate those rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.928" offset="18495634">Lo-Vaca, Lo-Vaca has here its application for a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.395" offset="18517577">Not for the sale where it is making what is essentially a direct industrial sale in the interstate commerce, but for the transportation and for the construction facilities for that transportation, it applies for a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.423" offset="18581629">It will in that proceeding, present a feasibility study justifying its proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4656.894" offset="18627500">Lo-Vaca also is making a sale for resale and will operate some of the same facilities in connection with the sale for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4666.723" offset="18666789">And its certificate application covers that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.243" offset="18688940">El Paso, if the Commission has a problem with El Paso coming to the South Texas to pickup this gas through the construction of this line, that line by El Paso gas supply, and actually the El Paso running from Sonora to Three Rivers, must be certificated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.873" offset="18803461">The Commission's consideration in certificating that line is much like the Commission's consideration in the Transcontinental case which came before this Court, where the Commission and the Court were concerned with the public convenience and necessity for transportation in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.994" offset="18895935">And the Court held that in it's public convenience and necessity determination, the Commission could consider what the gas was going to be used for, and it also consider at the other end the price of the gas, and its consideration of public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.269" offset="18993006">So to here, when El Paso comes before the Commission for it's certificate for that line, the Commission can consider whether these prices are high or low or whether El Paso should buy this gas for compressor fuel or whether it has a presumably some other source and whether it has too much gas on its system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4775.035" offset="19100108">Those things are matters which the Commission has full power over.</text>
            <text syncTime="4784.840" offset="19139291">I would like to point out further that the Commission suggests that there were several dire results which might come to pass if this kind of a transaction is permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4802.762" offset="19210971">The Commission has permitted this type of transaction for 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.600" offset="19238348">And so far as I have been able to determine, these dire results would not come to pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="4815.372" offset="19261440">I submit that they have not come to pass because the Commission does have full power in its certificate proceedings to control any unwanted result.</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.631" offset="19314521">Furthermore, it has power in rate proceedings to regulate El Paso's rates in such a way that for instance it could roll in average as it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.832" offset="19379304">All of El Paso's purchased gas costs both gas be resold and gas which is not resold and get a unit cost so that there is no question of preferment insofar as the resale costumers are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.658" offset="19466553">Finally, I think it is significant really that what the Commission is doing is seeking to increase its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.682" offset="19506678">This is not a chipping away from jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.816" offset="19523187">This is an increase of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4883.580" offset="19534263">What the Commission is saying is that any delivery by anyone either by -- for any type of the sale is a -- into a commingle stream where a portion of that commingle stream is being sold for resale, is converted itself into a sale for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4909.158" offset="19636558">Perhaps the -- the extent of the expansion of Commission's jurisdiction can be illustrated by reference to the sale by El Paso to the companies at the California border.</text>
            <text syncTime="4927.933" offset="19711687">El Paso sells a large amount of gas at the California border for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.132" offset="19744496">For every single Mcf of gas that is sold by El Paso to the companies at California border, there is if you affirm the decision of the lower court a producer sale to El Paso which is a sale for resale in interstate commerce which the Commission regulates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4961.622" offset="19846478">There is a direct coincidence for every Mcf of gas sold for resale at the California border.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.526" offset="19894021">There would be sale for resale over which the Commission has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4977.853" offset="19911367">However, if the Commission's view holds here there will be more gas sold to El Paso for resale subject to the Commission's jurisdiction than there is in fact resold, we submit that the parties have entered into sales, effective sales, to El Paso either for its own use or in intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5018.536" offset="20074057">Having done so, the description of the type of sale in Section 1 (b), which is subject to Commission's jurisdiction, does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.996" offset="20135915">On the other hand, these sales come within the other clause of Section 1 (b) which says that the Commission shall not have a jurisdiction over any other type of sale in which this Court in the Panhandle case has said of any other type of sale of whatever sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.349" offset="20233300">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="5082.801" offset="20331102">This is the first time that anybody's attempted this type of contractual segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5087.828" offset="20351269">If we've allowed things from the last 25 years, he's talking about the transportation deals which I mentioned before.</text>
