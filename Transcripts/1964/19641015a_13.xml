            <text syncTime="30.637" offset="122462">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.821" offset="143256">In this case, the government is petitioning from a ruling, invalidating two so called statutory presumptions added to the alcohol, the Federal Alcohol Tax Law in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.237" offset="212846">To state the underlying facts of this case very briefly, in March of 1960, federal and local agents were staking out an elicit country still in Dooly County, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.807" offset="279197">While the officers were waiting there, early in the morning, a truck arrived carrying the three petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.686" offset="306678">One of them got out, was apprehended, two others were apprehended in the truck as they were attempting to escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.627" offset="342413">This was at the sight of the still. Distill was going, it was apparently ready to produce its first run.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.073" offset="376268">On the truck, a butane tank, a tank of butane gas was found which matched those found at the still site.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.915" offset="411585">Shortly after the arrest, one of the petitioners admitted that the still belong to all three of them and that they were preparing to make their first run from it that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.071" offset="464248">And finally, the owner of the land on which the still was located at the trial testified that one of the petitioners had approached him about doing a little business down by the creek.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="136.592" offset="546273">The admission by the petitioner Barrett, Your Honor, was made after the arrest and apparently very shortly after the arrest, still at the still site.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.918" offset="587651">The testimony of the landowner was at the trial several months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.356" offset="613355">All three of the petitioners were indicted on four counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.137" offset="628506">They were first charged with possessing an unregistered still, secondly with carrying on the business of a distiller without having posted the required bond, thirdly with carrying on the business of the distiller with intent to defraud the government taxes and finally in the fourth count with working at an unposted distillery, that is to say distillery at which the sign displaying the name and occupation of the owner had not been displayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.855" offset="759327">At the trial, there was directed verdict with the consent of the government as to the so called working count, the last one I've described, that is working without the sign being posted.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.243" offset="812931">The judge in his instructions to the jury and this is where the heart of the case is referred to the presumptions created by the 1958 Amendments to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.042" offset="884088">He explained that Congress had recently enacted statutes, which permitted the jury to infer from presence at an unregistered still, which was set up and in the other case which was going, that those found there were in fact possessing still, all were in fact carrying on the business of the distiller without bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.119" offset="992444">The judge however was very careful to explain to the jury that they were not required even if they found such presence and even if they found such presence unexplained, they were still not required to convict.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.215" offset="1060780">The statute merely permitted them to do so as he put it if they wished.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.250" offset="1084918">The jury did convict on all three counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.172" offset="1104666">The Court of Appeal reversed on all counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.939" offset="1123683">We're only concerned with the first two counts, however, the reversal along the third count, distilling, carrying on the business to the distiller with the intent to be fraud the government is not included in our petition and is not affected by the presumptions at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.306" offset="1225143">The Court of Appeals thought the two presumptions involved were unconstitutional as violating the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, but before going any further, I think I should emphasize several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.406" offset="1289613">First, though there was clearly ample evidence to sustain the convictions on the first two counts without any reliance on the presumptions and the Court of Appeal so found and remanded for a new trail as to the first two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.952" offset="1347709">We do not here make any harmless error argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.554" offset="1362129">We agree with the Court of Appeals that it is impossible to tell to what extent, if any, the jury relied on the presumptions in finding the verdict guilty and that therefore, if the presumptions are indeed unconstitutional, a new trial is in order, that a new trial is permissible since there was sufficient other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.810" offset="1463171">On the other hand, we find out that there was a general sentence as to all three petitioners and that therefore, the judgment of the District Court and the sentence can be sustained and should be sustained if the conviction on either Count 1 or Count 2 is sustained, that is to say if either of the presumptions underlying either of those counts is sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.187" offset="1576647">And finally, we emphasize that the two presumptions involved here, the one going to possession, the other going to carrying on the business to the distiller without bond, do not stand or fall together.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.473" offset="1625861">We view them quite differently and as I hope to make it clear and as I think our brief says quite forthrightly, we view one as much stronger than the other and we place our primary reliance on that presumption which operates with respect to the substantive offense of carrying on the business without bond rather than on the presumption dealing with possession of an elicit still.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.357" offset="1753339">The presumptions involved that I already described that I should state them a little more in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.630" offset="1794508">First, the statute says that as to anyone found present at the sites of an unregistered still, which is set up, that is to say which is ready for operation, the jury may infer that he, the person found there, is the possessor of the illicit still, if that person does not satisfactorily in their view explain his presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.326" offset="1945287">The second presumption is that as to anyone found at the site of an elicit still which is not only set up, but which is also going, the jury is entitled to infer that that person is carrying on the business or of course aiding and/or abetting in carrying on the business of a distiller without bond and as I say it is as to the second presumption that we feel we have a stronger and a clear case.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.202" offset="2100767">The standard under which these presumptions are to be tested are not really in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.822" offset="2127203">I think the rule is so well settled by decisions of this Court that no issue of it is made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.584" offset="2170253">The basic test as reiterated in those decisions is that there must be some rational connection between the fact proved, a fact which gives rise to the operation of the presumption and the fact inferred, the ultimate fact, in light of common experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.631" offset="2266488">In judging the presumptions here because they all created by Congress and because they are not merely permissible inferences which a court finds reasonable if made by a jury, there is a special difference due to the congressional judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.383" offset="2341512">But the question merely is, was it reasonable for Congress to suppose that a jury might reasonably infer from presence under the stated circumstances that the person found there was aiding and abetting in the distilling without bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.740" offset="2430955">We recognize also of course that the presumptions must not operate in such a way as to deprive the defendant of his privilege not to take the stand or otherwise place him at an unfair disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.017" offset="2507964">I should emphasize that the presumptions we're dealing with here are merely permissive, not only are they rebuttable presumptions, but they're permissive in the sense as the judge clearly instructed here, they're none binding on the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.234" offset="2568882">He tells them, “If you find these people were present and if you are not satisfied with their explanation, you'd still need not convict them, but you may do so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="657.119" offset="2628441">The explanation referred to in the statute is also quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.836" offset="2647249">It was quite clearly charged in this case, need not come from the defendant himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.415" offset="2669610">There was a suggestion that the defendant must himself take the stand to rebutt the inference that arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.563" offset="2698240">That rebuttal may come from any evidence he chooses to introduce, many witnesses that may put on.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.248" offset="2728960">Indeed it may come from any circumstances in the case, including the government's own evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.944" offset="2751739">There well be that the government's proof will show circumstances which on their face explain the presence of the defendant site and from the very start make the inference impossible or unlikely.</text>

            <text syncTime="730.344" offset="2921326">Well, there is a clear decision to the contrary in the Six Circuit, but it is a per curiam opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.760" offset="2951001">I believe it's the Phillips case cited in the petition for certiorari, but the Second Circuit case dealt not with either of the presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.054" offset="2984124">Well, it may also dealt with these, it dealt also with the different presumption, one that there is an operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.607" offset="3022367">Perhaps this is the opportune moment to say that the opinion below insofar as it deals with the presumption, we are primarily talking about here that is carrying on the business of the distiller without bond is indefensible on its face in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.975" offset="3111811">The opinion deals primarily with the irrationality of presuming that a man present is the possessor of the still taking a very narrow view of possession and basing its narrow view of possession on this Court's decision in Bozza which as I shall try to explain later, we think was legislatively altered or overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.308" offset="3209195">But from that premise, that presence is not the proper predicate for an inference of possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.021" offset="3248065">It then goes on to say, a fortiori presence cannot bring us to an inference of carrying on the business of the distiller assuming that the necessary intermediate link is a finding of possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.241" offset="3316924">In other words, assuming that one carries on the business has to be a possessor.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.110" offset="3340434">In viewing that, it expressly ignores this Court's holding in Bozza where the Court found as to the defendant that whereas he was not a possessor, he was carrying on the business of the distiller.</text>

            <text syncTime="875.049" offset="3500095">To begin, I think we have to look at the case in terms of what is something of a hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.526" offset="3534054">I think my opponent concedes that everyone likely to be found at the site of an illicit still is probably guilty of violating some section or other of the Alcohol Tax Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.291" offset="3625064">There is very little case to be made for the stray hunter of the accidental fisherman who wanders inadvertently onto the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.064" offset="3668219">The reasons why this is unlikely and I think my opponent recognizes it, is that stills are located in isolated places.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.327" offset="3701238">Every effort is made by the operators to keep away strangers.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.721" offset="3718792">A very stiff penalty is imposed on anyone in anyway contacted, in contact with the still discourage strangers from coming near the still and it does encourage those who are there for business reasons to keep potential witnesses at a minimum and therefore to discourage and frighten away anyone who happens close by.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.909" offset="3843553">So, what we're really talking about is the problem of those who are there, who are guilty of violating some section of the Alcohol Tax Law and the question is whether it is fair to charge them with violating the particular section that deals with carrying on the business of the distiller without bond.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.806" offset="7595154">And what disturbs the respondents in this case is the fact that in effect Congress has said that “If you are there, it's enough to convict you of this or any number of other offenses under the law.”</text>
