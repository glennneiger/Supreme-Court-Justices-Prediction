            <label>Mr. Bruce J.Terris</label>
            <text syncTime="17.179" offset="68650">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.618" offset="82442">As has been indicated before, this case involves basically the same issues as are involved in the Ryan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.976" offset="107833">The only real difference being that here there were second examinations of the taxpayer's records but notices under Section 7605 (b) had been sent.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.492" offset="165930">I'll give the facts briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.709" offset="178782">Respondent Powell is the president of respondent William Penn Laundry Company which is the taxpayer, which is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.219" offset="212846">Mr. Powell received an Internal Revenue Service summons, give testimony, produced books and records of the company relating to its tax liability, the company's tax liability for the years 1958 and 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.553" offset="274181">The time the summons was issued, the statute of limitations, the three-year statute of limitations had elapsed although not the six-year.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.291" offset="317127">As I've indicated since they're already been prior examination of the taxpayer's books, the statutory notice was sent by the Regional Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.032" offset="356101">At the administrative hearing, Mr. Powell refused to produce the books on the advice of counsel on the ground that the Government had made no showing of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.377" offset="405420">In proceeding to enforce the summons in the District Court, the Government introduced the affidavit, not the testimony, the affidavit of an agent stating that on the basis of investigation, he had reason to suspect that the taxpayer has filed false and fraudulent returns for the years 1958 and 1959 with intent to evade its taxes and that the taxpayer had attempted to evade these taxes and I quote, “By overstating the amount of purchases made which in turn were used as expenses, so as to fraudulently understate the amount of taxable income.”</text>
            <text syncTime="139.653" offset="558602">The District Court, while indicating doubt as to the legal rights of the respective parties, apparently compromised, and allowed the revenue agents one hour to examine the taxpayer's books.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.626" offset="614504">The Third Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.683" offset="626730">It held that the summons was invalid on the ground that after the running of three-year statute of limitations a reexamination of the taxpayer's records is unnecessary under Section 7605 (b), unless the Commissioner shows that he has reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer has committed fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.821" offset="711262">Therefore, the issue in this case is the same as the issue in the Ryan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.588" offset="738325">Whether the Government must show probable cause or reasonable grounds to believe which is the equivalent before it can obtain judicial enforcement of the summons which is as part of investigation after the three years statute of limitations has run.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.510" offset="813976">Now, as I've indicated the basic arguments of the government are the same as in the Ryan case and I will not repeat them.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.433" offset="841665">I would however, like to turn to the practical effect of the taxpayer's argument or the respondent's argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="242.289" offset="969143">The reason I say that this makes no difference is once you've satisfied that part assuming there are two parts to the statute of 7605 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="249.012" offset="995997">Once you've satisfied the second part and then your back under the first part again.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.873" offset="1011461">And so that is the issue, whether the first part of Section 7605 (b) can be read separately from the second part and if read separately, means that the Government must show probable cause after the three-year period has run.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.924" offset="1199647">Well, Your Honor, I think there are two possible sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.792" offset="1211141">One is the Fourth Amendment, Oklahoma Press -- the Oklahoma Press case indicates that when a subpoena is sufficiently burdensome, sufficiently broad, and I assume it doesn't say this, is issued in bad faith, it would be considered unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.570" offset="1274253">It might be considered unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.765" offset="1283030">I think there's another possible ground that is that the Government is asking the courts to enforce process and if indeed the process is based on bad faith, I think that there would be substantial argument that the courts need not enforce the summons.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.820" offset="1767236">That's right, we don't know that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.103" offset="1776327">In fact, depending on what the underlying facts are, we may only have this – an inkling that this is what occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.563" offset="1806211">And putting into words of Oklahoma Press, we need this information not to prove that a violation of the law has occurred but to find out whether there has been any kind of violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.886" offset="1859500">We turn into the practical consequences of what respondent's argument in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.876" offset="1887504">If it's the First Circuit holds and respondents apparently agree with this, the standard of probable cause under the Fourth Amendment applies, I think it doesn't require much stretch of imagination to see how seriously this would interfere with investigations for fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.701" offset="1954795">It would mean that the service we have far toward proving fraud before it could investigate fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.711" offset="1982798">That even if a lesser standard were imposed, the service would be prevented from pursuing investigations where they had some reason to suspect that fraud had been committed but they had no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.211" offset="2028774">We think that under a self assessment system of -- for the tax laws that it's essential that the Government, and apparently, Congress agreed, should have broad powers to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.851" offset="2091363">And when fraud has been committed, the investigation of course, is particularly difficult because it's been covered up in most instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.230" offset="2120829">Now, another practical consequence is the petitioner's argument, as I've indicated before, is really asking for miniature trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.810" offset="2155207">This isn't like a search or an arrest warrant, he wants a trial, he's got counsel there, he wants to cross-examine witness, he wants to put on his own witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.520" offset="2198047">So we're going to have a trial before we can investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.911" offset="2211631">Not only we're going to have a trial but we're going to have an appeal and presumably then the Court of Appeals is going to look at the Government's evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.671" offset="2238589">In fact of course, that's what -- that's what happened in this case and has happened in the First Circuit cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.364" offset="2261368">And ultimately, there could be a petition to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.440" offset="2277669">All this time, investigation will then stop because usually the crux of the investigation, before you hardly get off the ground is a look at the taxpayer's records.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.310" offset="2329182">And as I've indicated before, it's virtually certain that if this is allowed, there's going to be a great increase in amount of litigation as everybody is going to be able to block investigations for two or three years as these have been stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.015" offset="2396056">Merely, I'm putting the Government to its proof and that litigating whether this proof is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.448" offset="2421760">And we submit that this is a heavy burden on the surface and also on the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.964" offset="2455824">I like you to turn quite briefly to an argument which is made in this case and was not made in the Ryan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.021" offset="2500023">Respondents argue that four early cases required proof of probable cause for enforcement of the surface summons after the statute of limitation had run and that the reenactment by Congress of Section 7605 (b) constitute a congressional adoption of the interpretation of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.436" offset="2613708">However, it's interesting that there was at least one other case that even if there was -- at approximately the same time as these early cases which held to the contrary, so there was some split of authority even then.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.225" offset="2668878">But even decided from that, this rule of congressional adoption, the judicial decisions is premised on the theory that Congress either knew of the decisions or at least could be assumed to know of them such as decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.260" offset="2724989">I don't think we can realistically assume without any indication of legislative history that four lower court decisions were known to the Congress when it embodied the predecessor of Section 7605 (b) in the 1939 and 1954 Code among the thousands of sections which were enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.622" offset="2810462">Now, I like to turn to the Government's alternative theory which I've indicated before in the Ryan case and it also exists in this case, and that is even if the Government does have to say something about what its suspicion, that it has suspicion or even it has to go beyond that and has to make some kind of a statement of what its suspicion is grounded upon, that there was sufficient indication in this case to satisfy that kind of a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.655" offset="2934596">Here, as I've indicated, the affidavit of the agent says it upon investigation, he suspects that there was fraud and he gives inconclusive returns that it's true, that he gives conclusory terms the basis for a suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.355" offset="3013381">Your Honor, I'd like to save the remainder of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="758.816" offset="3035220">If petitioner -- with -- if the position urged by Ryan or Powell were accepted, will the practical effect be that he Government would get the books only if the taxpayer who himself was suspected of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.989" offset="3123931">If he -- if he came into Court and asked for books, the taxpayer said, “Well, the statute barred.”</text>
            <text syncTime="787.284" offset="3149113">The judge says overrule it.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.574" offset="3154233">“You must tell me that you suspect fraud or tell me a reasonable cause of fraud is I take that means fraud in connection with fact factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="797.799" offset="3191118">Well, that's -- that's somewhat complicated Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.049" offset="3200104">One problem is that there seems to be a split on authority and whether Section 7605 (b) applies to third parties at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.297" offset="3233123">If it doesn't apply to third parties at all, Second Circuit seems to indicate it doesn't apply to third parties at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.208" offset="3260813">That would mean that we could presumably go to the bank or anything like that with just the showing the relevancy and materiality and that would be sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="824.345" offset="3297280">7602 gives you authority to get the taxpayer's books where you can look for gift tax than somebody else could.</text>

            <text syncTime="835.234" offset="3340852">That is held and it seems to be accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.549" offset="3354122">Now, if Section 7605 doesn't -- doesn't apply to third parties then as I say 7602 applies alone in and only relevancy and materiality be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.137" offset="3404487">If 7605 (b) does apply to third parties, then presumably we have to make the same kind of showing about our suspicion of fraud with relation to the taxpayer before we can get those records.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.439" offset="3465718">I think that the First Circuit's view, there's no indication that's restricted just to the taxpayer and that I would assume that it's view is that we're similarly limited as to third parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="888.480" offset="3553907">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.262" offset="3561012">It seems to me that the question that Mr. Justice Black has asked about what would be the practical result, the question Mr. Justice Harlan asked in the form of an exclamation that would be quite a trial and the questions Mr. Justice White asked called for the application here of Mr. Justice Holmes' classic comment that a page of history is worth a volume of logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.456" offset="3669786">Because history shows that none of these theories would be realized indeed none of them has been realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.281" offset="3697058">This is not the first time that this issue has been litigated in the courts nor is it the first time that the governments have been called upon to take a position.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.245" offset="3732898">History records that the Government has had a remarkable amount of success without taking the position that it takes here.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.324" offset="3761215">The Government today argues what it calls an alternative theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.481" offset="3781904">Well, first I say Your Honors that that alternative theory is not available to it, under the rules of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.107" offset="3804369">It is not the question presented in the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.304" offset="3821192">In the lower court when the judge insisted on the witness appearing, the Government refuse to permit them on the ground of testimony could mean nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.911" offset="3855569">They were taking the flock position that once the Regional Commissioner made a determination that they should be an examination, no testimony, no showing of any kind was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.721" offset="3906873">That if it please the Court, is the issue in this Court and that is the issue to which I intend to address myself unless the Court requests otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.185" offset="3944699">Now, as to the history, first let me note that these are as has been indicated old statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.919" offset="3971657">The particular section has been so much in discussion here with the last of the four that have been under questioning and answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.631" offset="4006452">7605 (b) was adopted in 1921 the others are all earlier and I need not labor the point that fraud cases have arisen since 1921 many, many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.422" offset="4065593">Now, during most of those years that the statutes have been effective, if it please the Court, the Government took the precise position in court that we are taking today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.818" offset="4107180">Namely, that if it wishes to lift the bar of 6501, if a taxpayer says, you have no right to assess therefore there's no statutory purpose to be served that the Government has then put to what, to a burden of showing some reasonable basis not a proof of fraud, that was early rejected by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.479" offset="4197878">Some reasonable basis were singling out this taxpayer not as before the three years just for a routine examination but for the owners, the owners to his employees, the owners to his neighbors, the owners to his business associates, the owners to his bankers of being under the suspicion of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.130" offset="4268513">And very early, the Commissioner took the position, “Sure we recognize that we've got to show a reasonable basis.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.895" offset="4295576">And so, if the Court please, in 1942 in Martin against Chandis, the Court expressly said that, “We have here two viewpoints, we have the viewpoint of the taxpayer who says the bar cannot be lifted unless and until the Government shows fraud” and said the Court, “We now have the viewpoint of the Government” who says, “No, we merely have to show a reasonable basis for suspecting that fraud exists.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.936" offset="4419709">I may say to Your Honor that they have not faired badly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.198" offset="4432771">There are eight cases in which they produce testimony and seven of them in which they produce even live witnesses, in seven of them the Court of Appeals have granted the request and then the one which was not granted O'Connor against O'Connell, the man appeared simply to say, “I won't give testimony.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.569" offset="4518243">So that in seven out of the seven cases, in which the Internal Revenue Service took the position I've enunciated in the Courts of Appeals, it has met with success.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.991" offset="4563905">Now, what about these early cases that my friend referred to?</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.889" offset="4575504">Well, first was the Andrews case in 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.869" offset="4595461">In that case Judge Chesnut in the District of Maryland rejected the taxpayer's assertion that all that had to be -- that he had to prove fraud, and accepted the requirement that the Government had to prove a reasonable ground for suspecting fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.501" offset="4677904">The -- Judge Chesnut felt he was satisfied what the Government was requested of that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.199" offset="4700787">I've already told Your Honors about Martin in the Fourth Circuit where the Court expressly said we're not going to pass even on whether Government's contention is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.651" offset="4738508">We accept its contention and we find it has here met the burden and it met the burden by simply demonstrating that there was some reasonable ground to ask that the bar of the statute be lifted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1205.000" offset="4819905">And so the law stood, if it please the Court, Brooklyn Pawnbrokers and so on for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.328" offset="4845296">More laterally, the Internal Revenue Service has begun to suggest, as it did in the Second Circuit, and met a sympathetic response that it now has to show nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.821" offset="4891272">No change in the statute to explain that but that no longer does it have to show anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.331" offset="4909244">It merely has to say the Regional Commissioner has determined that an examination should be made, period and then the man is subjected to a fraud examination, make no mistake about it, it's labeled a fraud examination and it is a fraud examination and everybody so understands it, was told about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.355" offset="4993358">Now, what have the circuits done about that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.979" offset="5003912">Well, the First and Third Circuit has said, “No, we're going to hold you to test you yourself established of just showing a reasonable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.649" offset="5042573">In this case Your Honor, my friend is not correct in saying that we ask for probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.494" offset="5065874">We said to the tax examiner, “Look, you'll have a thorough examination here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.980" offset="5083847">You've had a thorough one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.544" offset="5090116">You've had an assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.429" offset="5097639">You've been through all these books with a taxpayer who owned the business and who was the president.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.669" offset="5114671">Now, he is dead and we want to know with him not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.627" offset="5130449">And with no one alive knowing anything about this, give us some indication” and those were the exact words, “some indication of what you have in mind” and the answer to that was the hearing is closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.383" offset="5177469">Now, I submit to Your Honor that this young man who happen to be a ward of mine and died within five minutes after he seem to be perfectly well, we were interested in protecting his honor against the fraud examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.924" offset="5227624">And if the Commissioner had shown us “some indication” he have had 100% cooperation and I'm here today because not that he wanted to show anything, he wanted to show nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.606" offset="5278407">The affidavit as Judge Hastie found is just a broad generality that means nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.003" offset="5299931">It isn't even consistent with itself because purchases can't be an expense by any system of accounting, but I don't address myself to that because that's not in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.641" offset="5342563">Now going to the Ninth Circuit, there we have a somewhat different standard but on very much the same line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.729" offset="5378821">In that case, that the former clerk of this Court, Judge Browning said, “I don't quite understand what probable cause means?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.341" offset="5413303">He said, “I want to be shown that the Commissioner had some basis for a rational judgment that fraud might exist in this case, a rational judgment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.329" offset="5457293">I'd accept that test, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.248" offset="5464921">I'd accept any showing that would persuade a reasonable man that it wasn't just a completely arbitrary thing that they desired to do”</text>

            <text syncTime="1440.033" offset="5760104">In the Brooklyn Pawnbroker's case, the judge there said that the bribe that the taxpayer of that freedom from unreasonable harassment which he has the right to exist under a democratic form of government is not something to which courts should lend their aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.331" offset="5829277">Now, all we have here Your Honors are cases that come to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.974" offset="5847876">These are only cases in which judicial enforcement is sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.752" offset="5866998">My friend says there are about a hundred fraud cases a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.567" offset="5882253">Well, of that hundred fraud cases a year, I would hope that the Commissioner would haven't the slightest degree of trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.961" offset="5907749">My friend says that in the Fourth and Seventh Circuits, the judges have not addressed themselves to the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.550" offset="5930109">Well, I'll tell you why Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.418" offset="5937633">Because in the Fourth and the Seventh Circuit the cases are cited in our brief, the testimony that the Government offered was so overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.699" offset="5974727">That the Court said, “Oh, go on with your examination” and granted them in both cases and by the way that was just in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.229" offset="6008895">That was just this past two years ago, three years ago that the Government was still appearing and not taking the position it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.584" offset="6038256">In our case, the judge begged the Government just to give them a witness and a remarkable sequence of events happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.127" offset="6064483">The judge said, “Well, I agree with the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.725" offset="6074828">But after all an hour is not going to hurt anybody, I'll ask them to be gentlemanly and kind and sweet and if you -- will you promise to be sweet?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.676" offset="6102622">And they said, “We'll promise to be sweet.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.014" offset="6108056">Well he said, “I'll give you an hour.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.663" offset="6114638">And we just didn't think the principle involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.646" offset="6126550">We didn't think frankly they could get anything in an hour even if there were anything there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.345" offset="6141283">But the principle was too big to give into that kind of expediency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.372" offset="6161450">My friend says that the Fifth Circuit permits examination under the theory he wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.987" offset="6195931">Well, that intrigued me when it was said in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.374" offset="6205440">It amazes me when it said in this Court because the same records I dug out of the cage in Louisiana were available to my friends on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.232" offset="6240862">I sent down to Louisiana and I got two extensive affidavits and I'm willing to submit them to Your Honors and to say that any time the Commissioner gives that kind of proof of a suspicion of fraud, he's certainly entitled to go on with this examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.397" offset="6309512">The Fifth Circuit is a clear circuit that has applied the test to which the Government requested and only in the Second Circuit, the Foster case has the Court in line which given the Government what it is now seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.996" offset="6371892">And in fact, the Government gave the Court what we are seeking, because in the Foster case, the Government went much farther than it did in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.737" offset="6418913">So that I suggest to Your Honors that far from being so onerous as to render tax collection difficult, impossible, the fact is that simple fairness would dictate that Congress should, if it didn't as I hope I can demonstrate it did, have provided this reasonable safeguard against the onus of a fraud investigation on innocent people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.718" offset="6526851">And I may say to Your Honors that even the innocent must stand the onus if there's a reasonable ground for suspicion of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.692" offset="6562691">It may be under that circumstance assumed that fraud will not be proof but obviously administratively, we have to allow the tax collector a very considerable leeway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.104" offset="6612323">Now, I dispose of Oklahoma Press and Morton Salt very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.665" offset="6630609">Those cases simply have no relevancy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.203" offset="6644715">What was involved there was the simple question of whether Fourth and Fifth Amendment objections to the statutory power was valid and the Court held they weren't valid, they're very broad statutes and I say categorically here that if Congress wanted to say broad or no broad, statute or no statute, all the Commissioner has to do is send an agent out without so much as a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.133" offset="6756519">Congress has the right to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.039" offset="6764147">We just don't think it did that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.670" offset="6774596">Now, as to this legislation I want to say this to Your Honors, we do think that there is significance that in the face of all these cases, the Court -- the Congress never changed the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.076" offset="6824229">And we think that it is not correct to say as the Government says in its brief that only when this Court has acted will the rule apply that Congress will be regarded when it reenacts a code and reenacts it again as having adopted the interpretation of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.380" offset="6905417">Only when this Court acts will that happen and I cite to Your Honors Missouri against Ross where this Court had not spoken, except admittedly by way of dictum and the reliance of this Court in imposing that view on the interpretation of the Congressional Act was based on lower court decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1865.660" offset="7462557">For example the sponsor of the bill in introducing that said, “it ought to be settled once for all when a man pays his tax”, which we of course have done, “unless there should be good cause for reexamination”, that's what I think congressmen, when it put in the provision that there should be no reexamination, unless it shall be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.419" offset="7561613">And I think particularly it meant that because when it wrote it, the statute that was on the books incidentally, I believe, Mr. Justice Goldberg was a five-year statute at the time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1928.014" offset="7711974">I'm arguing a reexamination but I believe that the Ryan case would call for the same rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.472" offset="7741858">I would have to say that very frankly, Your Honor, because the first part of that section which to my mind is as clearly separate from the rest as any statute I've ever read, simply says that no taxpayer shall be subjected to an unreasonable examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.176" offset="7800686">The only thing they did as to reexaminations was to put in a kind of intradepartmental rule, which the Commissioner could have done on his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.979" offset="7831824">All the excitement, Your Honor wasn't about that intradepartmental rule have the Regional Commissioner because we know very well that the Regional Commissioner is entirely subject with his vast amount of work to what this agent says.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.165" offset="7892637">If in the Ryan case it is true that the agent had a personal grudge because his brother was arrested, that wouldn't come to the Regional Commissioner, all he would do is he would say; go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.479" offset="7933910">So, it becomes pretty formal, and that's apparent in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.307" offset="7945195">For example, inadvertently, the cat was right out of the bag because he wrote his letter in February and then the affidavit of the agent quite inadvertent and I'm sure said that he has been conducting an investigation since February.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.122" offset="8000470">I don't think they caught up with that yet, because frankly I didn't catch up with it until three minutes ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="2007.478" offset="8029832">Well now, Your Honors, I want to make clear that under Section 7602, before the three years run, the Commissioner has almost plenary power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.766" offset="8083017">Just think of what he's got to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.132" offset="8088451">He's got the cover 16 million taxpayers with an obligation to do something, so there it's plenary in the absence of oppressiveness than the usual routine matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.318" offset="8133172">Under Section 6501, I think there's a prima facie presumption necessarily aroused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.265" offset="8169012">The -- under 6501, a real change occurs, it isn't routine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.985" offset="8195866">There can no longer be an assessment made by the collector, unless he proves an affirmative fact, it's no longer routine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.475" offset="8233900">Now, he's got to prove something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.701" offset="8242782">And what is that fact?</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.570" offset="8250201">That fact is that there is fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.010" offset="8263993">Now, 7605 (b) comes along and I suggest to Your Honors that what the Government is endeavoring to do is to sterilize 7605 (b) which was held as a kind of declaration of independence for the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.806" offset="8331180">He's got to say as Mr. Justice Stewart observed, he's got to say that that first sentence, is surplusage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.590" offset="8366289">He's got to say the first sentence that no taxpayers shall be subjected to an unreasonable examination and surplusage and then he's got to say, that what Your Honors said in Reisman, you didn't really mean because if it is true that Section 6501 has meaning when interlaced and intertwined with 7602 and 7605 (b) and against the background of the judicatory adversary hearing permitted and required under 7604.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.153" offset="8496588">If that is true, then the function of the court has got to be to hear and determine and that's what the word unreasonable was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.823" offset="8531278">It's the word like the word negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.431" offset="8537652">It's a word of flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.150" offset="8544549">What is reasonable before the three years statute becomes unreasonable after the three years statute and what is unreasonable after the three-year statute might very well be entirely reasonable before that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2201.620" offset="8806400">I think the Court was at it should be, very liberal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.303" offset="8821133">But I don't think the Court is barred in this adversary hearing from determining whether it is “unreasonable.”</text>
