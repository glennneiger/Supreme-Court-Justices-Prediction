            <label>Mr. Bernard Dunau</label>
            <text syncTime="18.045" offset="72098">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.987" offset="79935">There are two questions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.260" offset="92996">First, is a zoning ordinance which restricts the height of structures on land surrounding an airport for the purpose of maintaining safe and unobstructed aerial approaches, a taking of property which requires compensation and is therefore invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.025" offset="180036">Second -- the Federal Aviation Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.546" offset="214100">That's precisely what they call them in there too.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.996" offset="227892">The second question is whether an independent and adequate state ground exists which precludes this Court from deciding whether airport zoning is a constitutional exercise of governmental power.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.615" offset="290377">Now this is what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.091" offset="300304">In 1939, the City of Gary enacted an ordinance which declared that it needs shall acquire and operate an airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.616" offset="342413">In 1947, they got the land for the operation of this airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.430" offset="361639">They got it from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.374" offset="373447">The grant from the United States read that the land was given for an inconsideration of the development and operation of the demised premises as a public airport in perpetuity and for the benefit which shall accrue to the United States from the continued use of such property as of airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.415" offset="457561">There was to be automatic reversion of the title to the land to the United States if and in the event that the administrator of Civil Aeronautics or his successors determine that the premises have not been developed for airport purposes within a reasonable time or that after having been so developed, they seize to be used for airport purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.314" offset="545228">Gary promised that the airport will be operated as a public airport on fair and reasonable terms and without unjust discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.597" offset="586292">In 1948, one year later, Gary adapted a master airport plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.648" offset="610534">A plan called for the construction of three runways, an east-west runway which has not been constructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.245" offset="636970">A northwest-southeast runway which has been constructed but is not involved in this proceeding and a north-south runway which has been constructed and is the runway, we are particularly concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.608" offset="690364">In the construction of this airport, federal funds were used as well as municipal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.262" offset="713038">The federal funds were obtained as a result of a grant agreement between the Civil Aeronautics Administration, the predecessor of the F.A.A. and Gary, under the Federal Airport Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.097" offset="768313">Now, in September of '49, about the time that airport construction was to begin, the City of Gary enacted an airport zoning ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.541" offset="818155">This airport zoning ordinance which appears on the record of page 151, divided the land on which the airport was located as well as all surrounding land within a distance of two miles from the proposed end of the runway into four zones.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.796" offset="899135">The zones were a turning zone, an outer area approach zone, an inner area approach zone and a transition zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.817" offset="943229">In the turning zone, the height limitation was 150 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.578" offset="962247">The same height limitation pertained in the outer area approach zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.551" offset="982204">A particular zone we are concerned with is the inner area approach zone and the ordinance read this way, inner area approach zone as indicated extending 6,000 feet from the end of the proposed runway not to exceed height greater than permitted of 40-to-1 slope.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.175" offset="1060676">Now, a 40-to-1 slope means that for every 40 feet that you go out horizontally, you go out one -- you go out one foot vertically.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.074" offset="1104248">If this is your end of your proposed runway, you go 40 feet this way, you then go one foot of that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.809" offset="1131207">Your glide angle is this line between the zero point and the one foot point.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.156" offset="1160568">Now this glide angle continues out on the same line until it reaches 100 of the 6,000 foot mark, of that point, you have 150 feet here and your glide angle on your inner area approach zone is this line in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.133" offset="1228487">If you went out another 40 feet, you get two feet elevation, another 40 feet you get three feet and so on until you run the 6,000 feet at which point you reach 150 feet elevation which is the same elevation as the turning zone and the outer area approach zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.416" offset="1293584">There is finally a transition zone with a height limit based on a 7:1 slope which means for seven horizontal feet, you go up one foot vertically from the edge of the inner area approach zone to a maximum height of 150 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.339" offset="1365264">Now, perhaps a rough diagram will explain this a little bit better.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.363" offset="1385430">You have your runway here.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.901" offset="1403507">This is your north-south runway.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.471" offset="1417822">At this point here, this is the end of the proposed runway, you go out two miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.703" offset="1442795">Then you make a circle with the two miles and this entire circle which goes around the airport and the land surrounding it is your turning zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.538" offset="1486054">The height limitation throughout this entire zone is 150 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.107" offset="1504340">Now, at the end of the proposed runway, you go 500 feet this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.285" offset="1537045">At the end of the two miles, you go 2,500 feet this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.777" offset="1571004">This is your approached surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.400" offset="1581558">It flares out from 500 feet here to 2,500 feet there.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.070" offset="1604232">Now along this two-mile line, you have the 6,000 feet that goes up for your 40-to-1 glide slope.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.884" offset="1635474">This portion in here is your inner area approach zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.213" offset="1652820">This portion here is your outer area approach zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.339" offset="1665254">Your height limit here is 150 feet as it is throughout the rest of the turning zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.989" offset="1687928">Within this area here, your height limit runs from zero at the end of the proposed runway to 150 feet depending where along the 6,000 feet you area.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.038" offset="1728052">There is finally this transition zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.999" offset="1739964">This is a zone which is something like that, declared as a 7:1 off the edge of the approached area and it stops at the point that you reach 150 feet so that you have a truck in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.213" offset="1812793">The truck is made up of your 40-to-1 right angle and your transition zone at the side of it and this is your area approach zone, the plane comes in for landing circles on the turning zone and from within -- going out of this way.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.662" offset="1918642">It's a transition from the area approach zone to the turning zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.668" offset="1942570">It's the area which tells you from your lower height limitation here to your 150 feet here.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.686" offset="1970678">I'll try to explain this a little more later, but on this astray, your transition zone is the line, the 7-to-1 glide slope which indents from the area approach zone.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="509.136" offset="2036506">Well then for all practical purposes, there are some portions of the transition zone upon which no buildings can be built, is that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_dunau" startTime="519.110" stopTime="567.925">
            <label>Mr. Bernard Dunau</label>
            <text syncTime="519.110" offset="2076421">Some portion of the area approach zone and transition zone start with zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.702" offset="2098782">Now, in this case, I get a little ahead of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.232" offset="2116859">The boundary of a Grand Calumet -- the boundary of the southern part of the airport is the Grand Calumet River.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.451" offset="2153744">At the point that this ordinance begins to pinch a property owner, it is on this side of the Grand Calumet River.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.245" offset="2184882">On this side of the Grand Calumet River, before the petitioners move the river 175 feet, the maximum height limitation was 22 and one half feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.360" offset="2233365">So at the point that this ordinance begins to pinch, you can build structures up to 22 and one half feet but not in excess of 22 and a half feet.</text>

            <text syncTime="594.177" offset="2376620">This is the other property on the other side, the river separated and I'm assuming that the people who do this ordinance said there wasn't going to be anybody building structures on the riverbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.715" offset="2414759">So the point that it began to pinch -- adjacent property on this would be on this side of the riverbed.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="610.089" offset="2440255">And that's 22 and one half feet?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_dunau" startTime="611.405" stopTime="1044.413">
            <label>Mr. Bernard Dunau</label>
            <text syncTime="611.405" offset="2445584">That's 22 and one half feet, right.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.256" offset="2460944">Now, the ordinance provided that with respect to any existing structures at the time it was enacted, and with respect to any structures which could be completed within two years of the enactment of the ordinance, the zoning ordinance was to have no effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.674" offset="2550596">If such structures were in excess of the height limitations, these were non-conforming uses and they would have to be tolerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.910" offset="2579540">With respect to all other structures, they would be to comply with the height limitations except that this ordinance also provided for a variance.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.878" offset="2619455">If the adjacent property owner could show particular hardship and that his building of a structure in excess of the height limit could be accommodated in keeping with the spirit and the purpose of the ordinance, a variance would be granted and this was the essential scheme of the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.214" offset="2684761">Now the reason for the ordinance as recited in the preamble is this; Airport hazards endanger the lives and property of the uses of the Gary Municipal Airport and the occupants of the land in its vicinity and in effect, the airport hazard, reduces the size of the area available for landing, taking off and maneuvering of aircraft thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the airport and the public investments in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.060" offset="2808163">The preamble went on to overcome these hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.569" offset="2822269">The Board of Aviation Commissioners of Gary adapted certain standards for the safe decent, landing and decent of aircraft for the proper and safe use of the airport and landing fields in respect to height and location of structures and use of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.823" offset="2887262">And finally, the order that the preamble stated that the enactment of the ordinance was necessary in the interest of public health, public safety and general welfare to the end that creation or establishment of airport hazards be prevented to the extent possible by exercise of the police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.467" offset="2965838">One year later, in 1950, the lessees here, the petitioners entered into a lease agreement with Gary through the Board of Aviation Commissioners to operate this airport for 20 years with an option to renew for another 20 years and they invested about $400,000 to create the facilities necessary for the operation of an airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.727" offset="3054864">And this was the situation which prevailed until 1954 or 1955, some four or five years later when the respondent, the Indiana Toll Road Commission came on to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.669" offset="3106586">The respondent acquired a right of way during 1954 and 1955 for the construction of a toll road.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.722" offset="3142844">The part of the toll road we are concerned with runs in an east-west direction along the south boundary of the airport process.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.549" offset="3182132">It was a plot with a modification under the present -- toll road obstructs the property of the airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.460" offset="3217763">Now, instead of building this toll road on this side of the river edge, the people building the toll road in fact moved the riverbed over by 175 feet, the width of the river, built that toll road on the riverbed and moved the river on to the airport property.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.052" offset="3304176">They not only moved the river on to the airport property and built their toll road on the riverbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.167" offset="3324656">They elevated the toll road 30 feet above the ground level of the riverbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.882" offset="3351510">The consequence was that at the point that they built their toll road; the height limitation was a little more than 18 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.140" offset="3396545">They went up 30 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.720" offset="3402815">They penetrated the protected airspace by 12 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.383" offset="3417443">Had they stayed on this side of the riverbed they still would have penetrated the airspace but by less.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.650" offset="3438550">On this side of the riverbed had they gone up 30 feet, they would have penetrated the airspace by 8 and one half.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.316" offset="3469166">The practical consequence of penetrating the airspace is that before they violated the ordinance, you could fly plane on to this runway which were heavier than 15,000 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.275" offset="3529038">After you put this toll road up there, you could no longer fly plane safely weighing more than 15,000 pounds on to this runway, the consequences obviously, loss of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.850" offset="3583373">As a result, the lessees having been injured, damaged in their business, wrote a suit for injunctive relief and for damages based upon the violation of the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.776" offset="3635096">Now, the particular issue which we are concerned with today, first was raised in the Trial court in the course of trying this case when the petitioners moved or offered the ordinance into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.417" offset="3713567">At this point, when the petitioners offered the ordinance into evidence, the respondents objected to its admission, stating that the ordinance was a legal note.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.809" offset="3755154">And I think it's important to quote at this point precisely what they stated because this is the only contention that was ever raised either at the Trial court, or in the court below in the Indiana Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.232" offset="3804891">This is the only question which is here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.413" offset="3817639">This is what they stated in objecting to the offer of the ordinance into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.473" offset="3837806">The attempt to establish glide angles or slopes in controlling the height of structures and objects near an airport by zoning, is the unconstitutional taking of property without payment of compensation and is offensive to and violative of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States, and Article 1, Section 21 of the Constitution of the State of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.439" offset="3941669">The enactment of the purported airport zoning ordinance is an unlawful and unreasonable exercise of police powers by the City of Gary, in attempting through zoning, to do that which must be done under the city's right of eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.421" offset="4013662">The objection was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.866" offset="4019409">The ordinance was received into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.811" offset="4027141">At the end of plaintiff's case, the defendant respondent here, move for a finding in its favor and as read by the court below, the finding that it wanted in its favor was based on the same contention that it had made in objecting to the admission of the ordinance into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.757" offset="4103001">After trial, the judgment for a $164,000 was rendered in favor of the lessees in a motion for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.078" offset="4136229">In hike verb-ah, the identical objection to the judgment was repeated as had been made to the ordinance -- to the admission of the ordinance in evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1157.656" offset="4630570">And that before this toll road came up, you could use it for landing aircraft 15,000 pounds or more after the toll road came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.991" offset="4667873">You couldn't -- this was a diminished use of the airport, increased its usable -- usableness and the judgment reflects the damages as a consequence of that, the objection which the respondents made in the trial court and on the Indiana Supreme Court prevailed in the Indiana Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.307" offset="4753136">The Indiana Supreme Court said that this ordinance is wholly void, invalid as in entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.484" offset="4785842">It cited this court's decisions in United States v. Causby and Griggs v.

            <text syncTime="1213.380" offset="4853447">It's cited this Court's decisions in Griggs and Pennsylvania Coal Company v.

            <text syncTime="1229.402" offset="4917603">It's cited this Court's decision in Euclid v.

            <text syncTime="1287.190" offset="5148735">If I may, Your Honor I would -- I intend to come back to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.414" offset="5161587">I think the question of the independent and adequate state remedy ground cannot be understood until we first know what the Federal Airport Act is about, and what airport zoning does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.585" offset="5202338">At that juncture, I think, I can more intelligently talk to the Court about whether there is an adequate and independent state ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.263" offset="5228983">So if I may, I would like to defer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.959" offset="5247791">The technical foundation for all airport zoning in this country today is Technical Standard Order number NAT, promulgated by the Federal Aviation Agency which is in our brief as Appendix D at page 15A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.752" offset="5326994">This technical standard order is called a criteria for determining obstructions to air navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.088" offset="5356251">It measures the space around an airport which is necessary for safe and unobstructed flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.189" offset="5384673">This astray is the physical representation of the obstruction criteria as prepared by the Federal Aviation Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.764" offset="5426991">This standard the -- have the obstruction criteria divide the land surrounding an airport at the land on the airport itself into four surfaces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.289" offset="5469100">You have first your horizontal surface, which is 150 feet from the approximate center of the airport, and the elevation of 150 feet is measured from the highest usable part of the land area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.920" offset="5523644">This horizontal surface of 150 feet is the same thing as the turning zone in the ordinance we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.494" offset="5553946">Now, after the ordinance was enacted, the Federal Aviation Agency had a refinement on the standard that then existed, and they added a conical surface to this horizontal surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.966" offset="5599817">The conical surface is at a 20-to-1 glide angle from the edge of a horizontal surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.856" offset="5627402">Now the width of the horizontals -- or the distance from the center to the end of the horizontal surface and from the end of the horizontal surface to the end of the conical surface is based on the kind of airport you have will vary depending on what kind of airport you were dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.393" offset="5689469">I think it varies from 12,000 feet for an intercontinental airport to something like 5,000 feet for a secondary or personal airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.986" offset="5727922">This is called the pat of the obstruction criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.425" offset="5745685">This provides circling room for a plane to maneuver in order to get into a position to land or when it takes off to get out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.289" offset="5777136">Then you have the trough, the trough is the approach to surfaces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.012" offset="5807961">You have varying approach surfaces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.677" offset="5818619">In our case, we have a 40-to-1 glide slope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.300" offset="5829172">You can have a 20-to-1 glide slope, if you have a very small airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.371" offset="5845473">You will have to have a 50-to-1 glide slope up to a certain distance and a 40-to-1 glide slope for the remainder of the distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.143" offset="5872536">If you have an airport which is to take planes that can land on instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.614" offset="5894374">Again, at the base of the approached zone, you start with a particular width depending on what kind of a approach surface you're dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.477" offset="5933871">It always flares out to another width at the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.128" offset="5952470">And then you have your transition zone which takes you from your -- the edge of your approach surface, to the height of the adjacent turning zone or conical surface as the case may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.518" offset="6014015">You got to have this clear airspace in order to operate an airport safely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.217" offset="6032823">If you have got obstructions intruding through here, you cannot fly an airplane safely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.416" offset="6053616">And you've got to have it through out here because you never know when engine will go out, or when an aircraft will be in trouble and it would need more than the minimum of that as ordinarily necessary for normal plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.494" offset="6101891">Now of three ways -- there are three ways you can get to this protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.961" offset="6119758">You can buy all the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.389" offset="6133551">You can buy some of the land and get easements on other of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.152" offset="6152568">You can buy all, or you can buy some.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.550" offset="6166152">You can get easements on some, and you can zone for some.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.109" offset="6184333">The way it actually works is you do all three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.332" offset="6197290">You buy some, you get easements for some and you zone some.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.249" offset="6212963">The court below says, You cannot zone any and that is our question on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.769" offset="6238981">Federal airport or Airport zoning, at the heart of it, is the Federal Airport Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.560" offset="6266149">The Federal Airport Act is designed to effectuate a national airport plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.054" offset="6300212">And the plan is to establish a nationwide system of public airports, adequate to meet present and future needs of civil aeronautics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.798" offset="6343158">And the way, Congress did this was via granting a program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.039" offset="6360085">It will give money to counties and municipalities to build airports, if those counties and municipalities will build them in conformity with federal standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.994" offset="6399896">You comply with the federal standard, you get the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.275" offset="6409091">You are unwilling to comply, you do not get the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.790" offset="6427063">One of the standards to which the federal government exacts compliance in order to give financial aid is the elimination of safety hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.325" offset="6469277">The airport or the Federal Airport Act defines as an airport hazard, any structure or object of natural growth, located on or in the vicinity of a public airport, or any use of land near such airport which obstructs the airspace required for the flight of aircraft in landing or taking off at such airport, or is otherwise hazardous to such landing or taking off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.517" offset="6573976">When a sponsor which means a municipality or county that wants to build an airport submits a project application to the Federal Aviation Agency, it's required to conform to the standards prescribed by the administrator and amongst the standards it must conform to is safety of approaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.086" offset="6660284">When the F.A.A. decides that the project is feasible and is willing to grant money, one of the assurance is it requires of the sponsor is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.692" offset="6706678">The assurance in writing satisfactory to the administrator that the aerial approaches to such airport will be adequately cleared and protected by removing, lowering, relocating, marking or lighting or otherwise mitigating existing airport hazards and by preventing the establishment or creation of future airport hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.028" offset="6796016">And most particularly, in 1964 this year, Congress amended the Federal Airport Act to include as an additional specific assurance that there would be recourse to airport zoning as one of the means to eliminate or mitigate airport hazards and these are the specific words that Congress used, that the sponsor was to take appropriate action including the adoption of zoning laws that is that such appropriate action has been or will be taken to the extent reasonable to restrict the use of land adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity of the airport to activities and purposes compatible with normal aircraft operations including landing and take off of aircraft?</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.033" offset="6988069">And the purpose I think was succinctly summarized by Senator Monroney who is the chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee when he said that the object of recourse to zoning was to be sure that you do not penetrate the airspace necessary to safe operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.457" offset="7065809">And by that penetration, airports can be ruined by the construction of high-rise apartments, smokestacks, and similar buildings which encroach on the flight pattern?</text>

            <text syncTime="1789.855" offset="7159327">Now, when Congress wrote that in 1964, it was not saying anything new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.713" offset="7186808">It was confirming what the Federal Aviation Administration and the Civil Aeronautics Administration its predecessor had done from the time that regulation of this kind of a problem became a federal concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.018" offset="7239993">From the beginning, every grant agreement between a sponsor and the federal government included as part of the promise made by the sponsor that the sponsor will either by the acquisition and retention of easements or other interests in or rights for the use of land or airspace or by the adoption and enforcement of zoning regulations prevent the construction, erection, alteration or growth of any structure tree or other object in the approach areas which would constitute an obstruction to air navigation according to the criteria or standards prescribed in Section A of Technical Standard Order N.A.T. this is this thing here so that the grant agreements from the beginning required assurance that there was going to be aerial protection or protection to the aerial approaches either to conform with T.S.O. N.A.T. or its predecessors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.934" offset="7463706">This was the scheme from the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.204" offset="7472797">And from the beginning, the C.A.A. later the F.A.A. and the N.I.M.L.O., the National Institute of Municipal Law Officers promulgated model airport enabling acts and model ordinances to provide the machinery at the local level for effectuating this federal concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.249" offset="7552940">The state airport Enabling Act provided the machinery which would enable the subunits of the state government to enact zoning ordinances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1961.719" offset="7846870">I think the kind of an airport you build is the product of the cooperation above this -- the local government and the Federal Aviation Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.041" offset="7892114">Both have to get together and agree that there is a particular kind of an airport which is feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.282" offset="7913117">The Federal Government won't contribute money is to one which is not feasible in its view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.587" offset="7934328">The state government or the local government won't build which is not feasible from its point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.127" offset="7956480">So that the federal government is in on the planning of all these airports as I understand it because that is essential to the contribution of federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.764" offset="8014994">Now, throughout the time that this became a problem, that is protection of aerial approaches, there have been expert studies in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.235" offset="8044878">There have been at least three federal studies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.374" offset="8065463">All three concluded that you've got to have airport zoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.588" offset="8082286">And the idea was expressed about as well by a report of the House Committee on interstate and foreign commerce which we quote at page 30 to 31 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.212" offset="8124813">Hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent on airports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.496" offset="8141949">But unless an airport can be approached without encountering obstructions, the investment therein becomes valueless or the airport itself becomes a deathtrap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.545" offset="8186149">To protect passengers and flight crews, and to assure that airports can be used in connection with the defense of the nation in time of emergency, it is vital that there'll be adequate zoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.755" offset="8239020">Unless a zoning is accomplished now, before airport approaches off further obstructed, the task will someday reach staggering proportions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.529" offset="8278100">Few steps are of such urgency, few steps are so essential to promote safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.138" offset="8300460">The idea therefore I think can be summarized very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.746" offset="8314984">You've got to have airport zoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.398" offset="8321567">If you are going to have a safe airport, you've got to have airport zoning, if you're going to protect the investment in the airport, and you can't get safety or protection of investment by saying you can buy it all because you can't buy it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.228" offset="8380813">As a practical matter, there isn't enough money to buy it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.946" offset="8395755">Your only viable alternative is to have recourse to airport zoning or at least the significant part of the protection you need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.532" offset="8434103">Now, I do not understand that the respondents in this case in this Court could take any issue with anything I have set up until now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.641" offset="8466495">They appeared to agree that airport zoning is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.296" offset="8481123">They appear even to state that this ordinance on it face is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.620" offset="8498469">They changed their attack from an attack on the validity of airport zoning to a question as to whether its specific avocation in this case at this point is bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.366" offset="8557401">Before going to their version of what this case is about, I want to say then briefly this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.745" offset="8586971">The court below thought that this ordinance was bad on its face, on its interpretation of what this court did in Causby and Griggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.601" offset="8634305">In Causby and Griggs, this Court decided and only decided that frequent flights, low frequent flights over terrain which would drastically impair the usefulness of the land underneath those flights effectuated a taking for which compensation was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.734" offset="8714867">If you were taking an easement you had to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.659" offset="8730540">We have no quarrel with those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.269" offset="8740989">They do not stand in the way of what we are talking about at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.921" offset="8759589">Airport zoning deals with the use of land by the land owner, the property owner which interferes with safe flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.032" offset="8792085">Causby and Griggs deals with what -- what the fellow does is flying the plane which interferes with surface use of the land to protect against abuses by the fellow who flies the plain, you have Causby and Griggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.295" offset="8845166">To protect against abuses by the fellow who's got the land, you have Airport Zoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.623" offset="8866482">Now if you zone up to a particular height for the valid purpose of providing airport protection, you cannot build above that height but you can use the land below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.420" offset="8909636">Causby and Griggs says, if with respect to the use of that land below the height limitation, you are going too long and too often and you would pair drastically the use of that land, you're going to have to pay for the easement you acquire and you will have to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.447" offset="8981734">Airport zoning does not license interfering use of airspace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.848" offset="9003363">But the fact that you have zone land, to make it safe for planes to operate does not mean that you have got interfering over flights through that zone land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.792" offset="9051115">The two are separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.464" offset="9057802">You zone, you get a safe airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.861" offset="9067416">If in the operation of that airport, at any particular point you are having interfering over flights, you will pay under Causby and Griggs for those interfering over flights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.461" offset="9105763">That's all that Causby and Griggs says and it doesn't say a thing which begins to touch on the validity of airport zoning.</text>

            <text syncTime="2315.393" offset="9261558">That is correct because this is the same as all zoning everywhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="2327.694" offset="9310772">I've been zoned and I might like to use that property differently but I can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.540" offset="9326132">All zoning whether it's airport or any other kind of zoning limits the use of property, diminishes the uses to which property can be put.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.294" offset="9361136">That alone cannot be invalid unless our whole concept of zoning wherever is applied is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.910" offset="9383602">And obviously that is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.920" offset="9391647">And obviously respondent doesn't think it so because it wants to change the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.769" offset="9410978">It says we are not talking about the validity of this ordinance on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.559" offset="9434175">We are talking about a specific application of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.026" offset="9456013">When you go down 18 feet in a highly industrialized area, you are going down so low that you are taking the property for which compensation is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.848" offset="9495301">They cannot take this position in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.688" offset="9510661">That issue is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.487" offset="9521946">The record as made never tendered such an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.159" offset="9536575">The cases tried never tried such an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.969" offset="9551830">The cases appealed never had such an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.939" offset="9563742">The record does not present or preserve that kind of a contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.468" offset="9581819">And it wasn't in depth when the respondent in the Indiana courts restricted its attack to the validity of the ordinance on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.722" offset="9618808">Because under utterly clear Indiana law, if you're going to attack application, you must first seek a variance under the ordinance, and only after you have exhausted the remedies provided under the ordinance, may you then go into court and attack application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.979" offset="9687876">If you have not exhausted your remedies and you want to attack the ordinance, you are limited to where an attack from the ordinance on its face in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.262" offset="9724970">The people here had never sought a variance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.772" offset="9735001">The only defense they could make therefore was one that the ordinance was a legal nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.867" offset="9755376">So the record never presented the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.721" offset="9766870">Indiana law would not have allowed the presentation of the issue, had it been sought to be raised, the court below decided only the issue that the record presented and said this was a legal nullity, it would have reached the identical result whether you were talking about 18 feet, 28 feet or 58 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.958" offset="9843775">That was the rationality of its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.337" offset="9853283">It could not say it anymore plainly when it said this ordinance is wholly void.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.422" offset="9869688">It's invalid as an entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.171" offset="9880660">This Court therefore is being asked to decide a question which is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.499" offset="9901976">The record doesn't present that Indiana law doesn't allow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.595" offset="9918380">The Indiana Supreme Court and the trial court didn't decide it and I think that ends it in this case, in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.862" offset="9947429">Now if it doesn't end it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.122" offset="9956415">If we have to consider invalid application, let's look at what we have to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.744" offset="9978880">Because their version of it is by no means even when this record was shown, a comprehensive version of a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.770" offset="10006988">First of all, they talk about a highly industrialized area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.877" offset="10027468">This area in here is not highly industrialized at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.191" offset="10048679">The area here is highly industrialized and now here it is, and here it is but not here, if you're talking about application, this is where the highly industrialized area is supposed to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.630" offset="10094446">What you have here is the problem of the river and (Inaudible) through here and you have the track of a railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.076" offset="10132271">And at some place down in here, you also have residential construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.596" offset="10150348">Now, I want to illustrate what happens if you try to turn a case into something that was not tried below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.648" offset="10182531">I thought when I looked at the Airport Zoning map which is on page 158 that there was at least a part of the inner area approach zone which residences were in fact constructed and I quote it because I looked at this map and I saw blocks of houses inscribed and I just thought these were existing structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.884" offset="10303530">I am told there is not a blessed thing, nothing throughout this whole area here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.815" offset="10335190">It is swamp, it is sand, it is scrub oak, and you cannot build anything on it because you've got to have the kind of foundation which is not just economical to construct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.522" offset="10390047">Now if you try to consider a question of application when it hasn't been tried, you'll run into the precise trap that you look at a map, you think it shows buildings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3375.314" offset="13501231">I should like to deal straight away with the question of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.798" offset="13523174">It is plain that the Supreme Court of Indiana in this case decided a question of Indiana Constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.998" offset="13559954">Its opinion is at the very end of the record in this case, it starts on date -- page 208 if the Court cares to look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.913" offset="13591615">I think its page 210.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.599" offset="13598302">You will see that the Court stated the question before it as including the constitutional question as including a question of Indiana Constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.770" offset="13643024">It then went ahead and cited the relevant provision of the Indiana Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.867" offset="13671445">It cited in Indiana's statute about property rights in airspace.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.752" offset="13690984">It cited some of its own decisions interpreting the Indiana Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.616" offset="13714390">Now, I think there can be no doubt and I do not understand the petitioners to deny that the court below decided a question of Indiana Constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.614" offset="13758380">Now it is true that it also decided that this ordinance was invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.132" offset="13792444">But this Court long ago held that when a judgment of a state court rests on two grounds, one on state ground and one on Federal Constitutional ground --</text>

            <text syncTime="3471.066" offset="13884186">Nevertheless, what the Court held was that there's a conflict between the lack or what he's urging is, that it's a conflict between that interpretation in the state constitution and a federal statute which under the Supremacy Clause, the constitutional interpretation has to give way to it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hugh B. Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="3492.274" offset="13969032">Well, it the Solicitor General in the footnote on page 2 of his brief dismissed that argument summarily as having no basis in the law but I will talk a little bit about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.365" offset="14013440">That oral argument in the first place, I will take it on his basis as to what the court in Indiana held which is that it held broadly that all aircraft zoning ordinance, airport zoning ordinance, past, present and the future are invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.024" offset="14080000">We don't agree with that but let's take that as an assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.128" offset="14096509">Now what that argument really is and I don't believe that the counsel for petitioner can escape from, is this, and it seems to me an extraordinary argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.273" offset="14129006">What he is saying is that if the constitution of Indiana had in it an explicit provision in this state, if you wish to establish safe approaches for airports, you must do it by some regulatory measure that gives land owners compensation if their rights are adversely affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.041" offset="14216150">His argument is that that kind of an explicit constitutional provision would be invalid under the Supremacy Clause because of the National Airport Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.901" offset="14255543">Now I say that's an extraordinary contention because in the first place, it involves a limitation self-imposed on a state which doesn't affect the civil liberties or the rights of anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.699" offset="14306743">But apart from that, he is talking about a field in the statute, Federal Airports Act which does not in anyway conflict with that kind of a policy if the state wishes to adopt it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.938" offset="14359719">The Federal Airport Act simply does this; it sets out conditions which the local authorities must meet if they wish to obtain federal funds for the construction of airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.704" offset="14422727">And one of those conditions is that the local authority should buy some appropriate means, provide for safe approaches to the airport.</text>

            <text syncTime="3616.986" offset="14467866">It can be by condemnation or the acquisition of property rights or it maybe by zoning and I was struck by the fact that the amendment which counsel read to the Court which is made in 64 said that this should be done by appropriate means including zoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.229" offset="14540904">Now, the Act specifically provides that federal funds maybe used for the acquisition of easements and airspace and for title to property that recognizes that state depending upon the choice it wishes to make may do this by acquisition of property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.835" offset="14619272">It may do it by zoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.513" offset="14625959">But that statute does not prescribe any method which the state must follow.</text>

            <text syncTime="3724.110" offset="14896379">I think that makes no difference Mr. Justice White because this Court has said -- it said plainly in the National Tea case that the fact that the state court uses the decisions of this Court as persuasive authorities doesn't give the Court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.078" offset="14960222">Now the interesting case in that respect is the case that the City of New York against the Central Savings Bank which is a case stated in 306 U.S. where the Court of Appeals in New York had held a state statute unconstitutional on both state and the federal grounds, and in its opinion, it had decided and relied upon decisions of this Court and not only relied upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.871" offset="15067429">It had said that it attached great weight to those decisions and it went a little bit beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.531" offset="15094073">It said that its decision that the statute was invalid under the New York Constitution necessarily followed from its decision that it was invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment and yet in that case, this Court denied a petition for certiorari and noted in the order that the denial was because a decision below rested on an adequate state ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.979" offset="15187905">Now, if there is no doubt -- put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.082" offset="15200235">There is nothing in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Indiana that even remotely suggests that it was constrained or controlled or coerced by any decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.227" offset="15248823">It cited those decisions together with its own decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.421" offset="15261675">It cited decisions of the Supreme Court of Washington and of the Supreme Court of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.718" offset="15286857">So that this case is not like a case, it does not resemble a case in which the court below has said something which could suggest that it was constrained or dominated or controlled by decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.331" offset="15337221">In the National Tea case for example, the Supreme Court of Minnesota in its first opinion had said it believed it was under duty to follow the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.581" offset="15390302">And the court -- Supreme Court of Indiana didn't say anything like that in this case and of course it didn't say anything that it resembles in any way what the New York Court said in the case that I referred to a moment ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="3929.901" offset="15719549">I find nothing in the opinion that would suggest the slightest to be that -- that there was any need for clarification on that point which was the reason that the court -- this Court in the National Tea case sent the case back to the Supreme Court of Minnesota to make sure that it was free of the compulsion of this Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3950.348" offset="15801365">And in that case, the Supreme Court of Minnesota said, yes, we are free and decided the same way on state grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.146" offset="15836578">Now that I think deals with the question of whether this Court should take jurisdiction of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.227" offset="15872836">It is our position that the decision below rests on an adequate and independent state ground and that they should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.147" offset="15912542">Now if the Court doesn't agree with us on that, we then reach the question of the merits case that is whether this ordinance is invalid as applied to my client's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.037" offset="15964056">In the interest of time, I propose to rather truncate my discussion at that point but I should like to say two or three things about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.346" offset="16001358">In the first place, this as applied to the existing property of my client, this ordinance imposes a height limit of 18 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.329" offset="16045244">The counsel of the other side, says it's 22, it doesn't make too much difference to me but the fact is that this toll road which they say violates the ordinance is now built in a place where the height limit is 18 feet.</text>

            <text syncTime="4135.808" offset="16543138">It did not take the initiative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4138.496" offset="16553900">My client raised the question of validity of the ordinance simply because it was sued as the matter of raising it as a defense we're not -- we didn't take -- we didn't -- we're not attacking the ordinance in the sense of having gone to court to attack it, we had no reason suppose we had to get a variance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.671" offset="16618684">So we had agreed we could build a road there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.693" offset="16626730">We built it there and then when were sued, of course, -- my client raised the invalidity of the ordinance as a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.881" offset="16659435">What I wish to -- I wish to say just two or three things more about the merits and then I shall submit that point to the Court on our brief which discusses it but I would like to point out that it seems to me that when you impose this 18 -- 18 foot height limitation or a 24 height foot limitation on land that it's no and this what the court -- this Court said in the Causby case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.245" offset="16772911">There's no difference and if you build an approach to a bridge over my client's land at 18 feet and ran traffic over that bridge because that's what this is about and take all of the airspace above 18 feet and use it for the passage of airplanes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.832" offset="16851278">Indeed, in the court below, the petitioners told the Supreme Court in Indiana, page 24 in their brief, that by reason of this zoning ordinance and the lease they had from the city, they had an easement in the airspace over my client's land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.339" offset="16925257">Now, I submit that if they had an easement that could only be obtained by taking it from my client and that it was a constitutional taking and it could not be achieved without the payment of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.042" offset="16976144">Of that, I think in very abbreviated form is the essence of our case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.565" offset="17006237">I do not understand the distinction that the petitioners try to make between this case in the Causby and the Griggs cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.772" offset="17035076">In those cases, the Court -- this Court held that there was a taking because intrusion into the airspace interfered with the use and enjoyment of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.843" offset="17075304">In this case, the 18 or 22 foot height limitation directly interferes with the use and enjoyment of the land because it prohibits the owner of the land from putting any structures on it that exceed 18 feet, from growing any trees on it that exceed 18 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.603" offset="17142387">It prohibits a variety of proper and normal uses of that land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.416" offset="17161613">I do not understand how this case can be on the taking point can be distinguished from Causby and from Griggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4298.048" offset="17192124">Now there's just one more thing I should like to say, though it seems to me perhaps unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.242" offset="17240921">The petitioner has made something of the point which I don't completely understand but I want to try to deal with and that is that we are not entitled to say in this Court that this ordinance is invalid as applied to our property because he says we -- apparently, he says or argues that we attack it in the court below on the ground that it was invalid as to everybody which is a proposition that I find a little difficult to understand because the only thing that was ever involved in this litigation was the application of the ordinance to my client's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.973" offset="17383863">My client was worried about somebody whose property was backed three or four miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.816" offset="17403193">He's worried about his own property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.972" offset="17411866">But I think it's important to make it clear that this point was before the Supreme Court of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.021" offset="17444049">The brief which my client filed in the Supreme Court of Indiana, it commented on the same exhibits which the counsel for the petitioner talked about when he said, we objected to their admission because he said the court -- the ordinance was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.014" offset="17507997">At page 248 of the brief that my client filed in the Supreme Court of Indiana, it referred to these exhibits and said this -- and these are exhibits that show the ordinance.</text>

            <text syncTime="4399.296" offset="17597127">The brief includes everything apparently, the record and transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.341" offset="17613322">This is a reference to the ordinance and to this map that was attached to the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4409.214" offset="17636833">And my client said this to the Supreme Court of Indiana, Since they were invalid and unconstitutional as applied to appellant, they were inadmissible and it was a reversible error to admit them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.394" offset="17689496">Now that's the question we put to the Supreme Court of Indiana, and the Supreme Court of Indiana understood it because at page 210 of the record in this case, it stated, the constitutional contention that my client had made to it and it stated it in this terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.965" offset="17767758">We consider of only appellant's second intention, namely that the provisions of the ordinance relied upon by appellees was unconstitutional and that it purported to appropriate without compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4456.174" offset="17824601">Now this is the important part -- The reasonable and ordinary use of the property on which appellant constructed the toll road.</text>
            <text syncTime="4464.977" offset="17859814">They're only litigating about that property, we weren't litigating in abstract or about other property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.756" offset="17878936">This was -- we made this contention in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.271" offset="17893042">And even if we hadn't, I should suppose that the normal course of constitutional adjudication this Court would welcome an advocate who presented the narrower constitutional question rather than a broad one, because this is simply allowed smaller constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4488.563" offset="17954168">It might be comprehended within a larger question about the invalidity of the ordinance applied in some general way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4494.578" offset="17978305">But that is not what concerns my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="4498.746" offset="17994919">Now I think in the interest of time, I shall conclude.</text>

            <text syncTime="4513.223" offset="18052807">I've tried at the outset to say that this was not an adequate state ground and I did not direct myself to our alternative position that it was not an independent state ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.576" offset="18098260">I want to talk about that for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.196" offset="18108709">Mr. Cox has said, he cannot see how this case can be distinguished from Causby and Griggs, but the court below used Causby and Griggs as the foundation of its proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.866" offset="18163461">How can you say, how can anyone say that there is an independent state ground when the foundation for it is this court's decisions in Causby and Griggs?</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.344" offset="18209332">It will not do to talk about the court decisions as persuasive authorities when the question before the State Court is whether the action taken is invalid under its own constitution and under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4568.860" offset="18275370">The decisions of this Court under the Fourteenth Amendment are not persuasive authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4573.791" offset="18295118">They are controlling, they are compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4575.863" offset="18303373">A state court has nothing to do but to follow them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.723" offset="18318838">When the State Supreme Court decided this case, on alternative contentions of Federal and State Constitution, and had read this court's decisions and we are told they cannot be distinguished, it had to follow what this Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="4592.615" offset="18370456">And if it had to follow what this Court said, it cannot be an independent state ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.112" offset="18392398">Furthermore, the decision in this case explicitly relies on the federal scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.682" offset="18430642">The Court explicitly states that its conclusion is consistent with the federal scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.814" offset="18451226">It totally misconceives the federal scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.870" offset="18463451">Now you take this, you substitute a right reading of Causby and Griggs for the wrong reading of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.551" offset="18494171">You substitute a right notion of the federal -- or the federal scheme for a wrong notion of the federal scheme and you cannot get this result from the court below if reason has anything to do with adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="4636.004" offset="18544013">How can the result be independent if it is premised and predicated on federal law?</text>
            <text syncTime="4642.677" offset="18570658">Now, two very minor points; we are told that the contention was raised that this question of application was raised and an isolated sentence is quoted at page 248, "Since they were invalid and unconstitutional as applied to appellant, and the word applied is taken as being the whole to do on how you get a particular issue raised."</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.173" offset="18660624">The word applied used on that page of the brief has nothing to do with application of the ordinance to the property at that point because the Indiana Toll Road Commission was also taking the position and this is an exclusive state ground which the court below did not reach that because it was the Indiana Toll Road Commission, a body politic, the ordinance did not apply to it and that is the only sense at which it ever use the word applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.984" offset="18763860">Finally, it says, we had a settlement agreement at the elevation and location, this record will not support that statement with the settlement agreement even if it's properly before this Court does not approve the elevation or the location.</text>
