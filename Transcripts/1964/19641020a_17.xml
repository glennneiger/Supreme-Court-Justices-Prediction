            <label>Mr. David Scribner</label>
            <text syncTime="19.849" offset="79308">Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.009" offset="91951">The issue here affects the interpretation of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, insofar as it relates to one specific issue and that is the question as to whether the District Court on the complaint of a private party that is a member of the union may it make a determination assuming jurisdiction therefore in respect to the reasonableness of eligibility qualifications for candidacy to union office, the far reaching nature of the ultimate determination of this is apparent because of the many thousands of union elections that go on everyday in the weekends throughout the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.373" offset="273450">If the question -- if the answer into this question is that the District Court may assume initial jurisdiction that is on the complaint of a private party and before an election has been concluded and obviously, every member of any union at any time prior to an election may attack candidacy qualifications under the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.785" offset="399047">On the other hand, if the answer is no, as I suggests and as the United States suggests in its memorandum to this Court which was asked for by the Court, then the relief to be obtained by a member who seeks relief in respect to eligibility requirements would be to make a complaint as the Act requires to the Secretary of Labor under certain circumstances and under certain conditions, the Secretary of Labor would then make the necessary investigation and under the circumstances set forth in the Act would then file a complaint in the name of the Secretary of Labor to the District Court for -- to set aside the election which is under attack and to secure a new election under the offices and supervision of the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.816" offset="603220">Now, the scheme of the Act as the petitioner sees, it is a fairly simple one, Title IV of the Act which was initially the subject of the Kennedy Urban Bill which initiated the entire legislative process in 1959, in which lead to the Act itself, provides for almost every manner relating to the election process.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.050" offset="704157">There more specifically, the Act provides and particularly in Section 401 (e), among other things that every member in good standing of the union has the right to be a candidate for election to union office subject to reasonable qualifications uniformly imposed by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.425" offset="813662">That is specific -- those are the words of the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.436" offset="829649">On the other hand, Title I, 101 (a) of the Act which is essentially the so-called Bill of Rights which had been introduced by Senator McClellan, as the result with his investigation, provides that every member of the union has the equal right to nominate.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.321" offset="925257">Enforcement under those circumstances, that is to enforce the equal right to nominate is on -- is in the District Court upon the complaint of the member aggrieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.119" offset="980428">Now the respondents in this proceeding, members of the union, nominated themselves under the union procedures that I will demonstrate in a moment and were then disqualified by the Credentials Committee of the Union after their nominations had been received because they did not meet the requirement of a certain amount of seatime.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.713" offset="1082828">Many unions, and frankly, most unions that I know of and particularly in the maritime industry have provisions for a certain amount of employment as the condition for candidacy in order to have people who would be officers, who will be familiar with the running of the union and the industry itself and the problems of the individual members and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.596" offset="1170286">They had nominated themselves only for the office of patrolman and for nothing else.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Scribner</label>
            <text syncTime="299.648" offset="1198498">A patrolman is like a representative of the union at the ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.889" offset="1215530">He meets the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.202" offset="1220754">He takes care of all the problems of the men as they come in from sea, as they come off the ship and then sees to it that their problems are met through the union, gives them advice and guidance is really the most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.490" offset="1269864">I would consider -- probably the most important single union representative or at least as important as almost anybody that I know of.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.937" offset="1295673">Well, he's not really like a steward because he's a full time employee of the union or elected official of the union but he's not like a steward because a steward normally is a member -- is a working man in the shop and is -- has been elected by the immediate persons in his department or division.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="343.452" stopTime="346.141">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="343.452" offset="1373727">Is it just one patrolman in each port or are there several?</text>

            <label>Mr. David Scribner</label>
            <text syncTime="346.141" offset="1384490">Well, there are different divisions there.A patrolman who is known as a patrolman is also a business agent for the particular port to -- who has a different status, but more or less serves in the same capacity.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="357.629" stopTime="371.467">
            <label>Justice Arthur J. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="357.629" offset="1430465">Mr. Scribner, as to the (Inaudible)?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_scribner" startTime="371.467" stopTime="519.876">
            <label>Mr. David Scribner</label>
            <text syncTime="371.467" offset="1485845">He can nominate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.688" offset="1494727">He may nominate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.855" offset="1499324">At least, that's the way the provision raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.678" offset="1510609">We're not contesting at this moment whether that was permissive or not permissive.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.352" offset="1525342">I think in the posture of the case let's assume, I think the record is that at this moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.779" offset="1543105">It happens not to be the fact, but it is not -- we're not raising that at this moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.680" offset="1558674">We'll say that he can only nominate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.361" offset="1569437">Every member of the union may nominate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.885" offset="1591484">The qualifications as we see it go to an entirely different question because if the issue were that any member can nominate persons who are qualified then we're mixing two questions as I think the Circuit Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.196" offset="1664731">What I suggest the Circuit Court did was to mix really apples and pears in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.129" offset="1688451">The apple is the equal right to nominate which is a nondiscriminatory right to participate in the nominating procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.250" offset="1720947">Let me give one example of the -- of a discriminatory practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.764" offset="1735053">Assume particularly here where you have seamen, these are marine engineers, who travel all over the world and maybe on ships a good part of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.350" offset="1773296">If the requirement was that in order to make a nomination, a member of the union had to appear at a union meeting, let say in Portland, Oregon, when he maybe in Japan or a large number of the membership maybe all throughout the world and if he doesn't appear at that meeting he cannot make a nomination, I would say that is exactly the kind of thing that was contemplated by the right, the equal right to nominate.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.351" offset="1901401">In other words that process, the nomination process.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.938" offset="1915716">On the other hand, if the question of qualifications which I consider to be the pear in this situation, were to be merged as the Second Circuit did with the apple and put them in a fruit bowl and then say, since they're all fruit, the pear is the apple, that is the pear being the equal qualification has to be considered if with the apple itself and somehow we have a denial of an equal right to nominate, in other words, an apple -- instead of an apple and a pear, that would the effect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.947" offset="2039745">There are two separate and distinct matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.918" offset="2051657">In fact, that is exactly the way the Congress considered it.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.092" offset="2068271">Now, the provision --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="519.876" stopTime="542.274">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="519.876" offset="2079451">Suppose your pear is the right to run for President of the organization and -- is this under your theory of the case is there inequality here?</text>
            <text syncTime="535.758" offset="2142981">Because I understand it in this union, the man had to be in the hierarchy to run for the presidency.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_scribner" startTime="542.274" stopTime="749.221">
            <label>Mr. David Scribner</label>
            <text syncTime="542.274" offset="2168999">Well first on the fact sir and at the -- record would show that any person who had previously held any office whatsoever or any time paid -- elected or paid, would be eligible for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.433" offset="2221662">I would say that the question there maybe the unreasonableness of the eligibility qualification which is exactly the kind of thing that the Secretary of Labor would have to look into.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.904" offset="2271608">Now in one union, it might mean a thousand people out of, let's say 2500.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.046" offset="2292088">In another union under whatever the circumstances are, the number of locals for instance, the number of officers within each local, it might be only ten.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.868" offset="2331376">Now, in one case that might be completely unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.002" offset="2343915">In another case it might be completely reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.974" offset="2355827">Now, whether it was discriminatory is not the issue because it might be discriminatory and unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.375" offset="2381427">But the question as to the equal right to nominate was one that was directed to the narrow question of the right to nominate.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.337" offset="2417267">Now, there has been a suggestion that perhaps we look at what maybe considered be effectiveness of the nomination and I imagine that would be a general concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.751" offset="2458958">Is the nomination an effective nomination, what uses there to nominate if ultimately there can't be an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.572" offset="2486230">But if we do that, we're destroying the whole scheme of the Act because only in Section 401 (e), that is in that Section which relates to the whole election process in the sense that the Secretary of Labor is to look at every aspects of it and then make his determination as the result of his expertise, his experience, his knowledge of the union, his understanding of the particular impact, a particular qualification which would have in a particular situation which might be entirely different in another situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.482" offset="2633874">On the other hand, the question of the equal right to nominate itself as I said before is one that goes to the making of nomination and the kind of things that I suggested before.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.387" offset="2677447">Another instance of that would be simply, suppose in a nomination meeting, you had a situation where only certain members could go into that meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.096" offset="2724362">Nobody else could walk into the meeting, a Sergeant-at-Arms stands at the meeting and by the way there were some instances of this that were referred to by Senator McClellan during the course of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.295" offset="2757172">And I suspect this is the kind of thing he had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.124" offset="2768457">You have a meeting and 50 men out of let's say 150 men who may want to attend the meeting are not permitted to enter into the meeting, a nominating meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.295" offset="2809104">They would have been denied an equal right to nominate.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.272" offset="2829061">If the two were to be equated, that is a question of eligibility qualifications with the right to nominate, then every qualifications in every union would be subject to a determination by a District Court initially on the complaint of an individual and without the intervention of a Secretary of Labor and the application of his expertise and knowledge in order to determine whether or not there was a so-called effective right to nominate which in the last analysis would be an equal right to nominate.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.041" offset="2988095">That's the way the argument on the other side goes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1170.287" offset="4681143">Under 101 (a), he maybe required to exhaust the administrative remedies and the Second Circuit in the Detroy case in which cert was denied a year has said that there is not mandatory in the 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.102" offset="4732343">But there's no question about a being mandatory in the 401.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.154" offset="4744568">Now, why do I advert to that?Simply because the legislative history show that he reason for the mandatory exhaustion was that the union is to be given the opportunity to make the necessary corrections to give it the opportunity to consider the problem before it find itself in a court proceeding and possibly under injunctive sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.825" offset="4839236">Now, in this particular situation and to which you refer Mr. Justice Goldberg, while the Secretary was investigating the Pacific Coast District and these very areas is the same union.</text>

            <text syncTime="1325.223" offset="5300872">The number of candidates whom I should have a right to nominate but of course, even Senator Barry Goldwater, who was the proponents for the view that there should be all kinds of legal sanctions against the activities of unions and in this particular area said in complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.177" offset="5396689">During the course of the debate and he was a member of the conference committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.933" offset="5411631">He said, Section 101 (a) (1), and this is in our briefs, does not give anyone the right of candidacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.968" offset="5451860">He says, 401 (a) does -- 401 (e) rather and that goes only, the complaint there can only go to the Secretary of Labor and he insisted that it would have been proper to have done it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.088" offset="5504313">In fact, Secretary Goldwater's Bill which he introduced during the early phases of 1959 and after the Kennedy Urban Ville had been introduced, provided that Section -- the rights under Section which is now Section 401 (e), that is the whole eligibility -- the whole election process provision should be enforceable either at the instance of a member in the District Court at any time or through the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.733" offset="5646838">Now, it's also curious that Senator McClellan who was the proponent for the basic legislation which is here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.207" offset="5688738">When he introduced his Bill of Rights on April 20 -- April 22nd, 1959 after the Senate Bill had already been adopted which did not contain the Bill of Rights at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.136" offset="5752477">On the floor of the Senate, Senator McClellan introduced his Bill of Rights and it was adopted the same day with very little discussion or as much discussion as can be had within the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.865" offset="5799393">It's interesting that his Bill, the McClellan Bill itself, provided that every aspect of the so-called Bill of Rights should also be in the Secretary of Labor' hands and should go there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.619" offset="5862400">Now, I say that because a good part of my opponents arguments are related to the fact that it was Senator McClellan's investigation and his desire that members should always be able to go into the Court to resolve any issue immediately in respect to union affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.126" offset="5936483">The fact is that then Senator Kuchel, two days later decided that it would create a preemption problem if everything in the Bill of Rights were to -- be left to the Secretary of Labor as well as all the other rights which were referred to and the original Kennedy Bill and they separated them and the 101 (a) (1) rights were set aside for the action of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.967" offset="6035853">What is also significant is that during the entire flow of this legislation, in its discussion at the halls of Congress, there was never a single suggestion by friend or foe of the bill of the legislation, in concept or in detail that eligibility requirements which is essentially the problem in this case should be the subject of direct court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.276" offset="6129058">I am very grateful for the fact that my friend, only yesterday, brought to my attention and I understand he has brought it to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.716" offset="6166779">A new decision of the Second Circuit, the same circuit here involved in respect to the very issue we're discussing today.</text>

            <text syncTime="1617.384" offset="6469486">The Second Circuit now says as its basic consideration of the problem are the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.240" offset="6496862">The right to nominate can be infringed by restrictions on eligibility for office as well as by rules dealing directly with the right to nominate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.258" offset="6545032">And further goes on to say in the Footnote, Footnote 3 on that page, appellants argue that a limitation on illegibility for office can be challenged only under Section 401 (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.031" offset="6592052">Section 401 to 403 are concerned generally with union elections and Section 401 (e) in particular deals with qualifications for office as well as for nominating and voting and with post-election as well as pre-election proceedings -- procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.787" offset="6671047">Now, what we have here is the -- what I consider to be the can out of the bag.</text>

            <text syncTime="1676.999" offset="6707931">It's the qualifications and the issues squarely before this Court is whether -- in determining whether the right to nominate, the equal right to nominate has been violated thereby giving the District Court direct jurisdiction, can the Court make a determination as to the reasonableness of the eligibility requirements thereby completely usurping the need for a uniform labor policy, the need for the expertise of the Secretary of Labor and the design of the -- in destroying the entire design that Congress created in a very difficult situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1749.146" offset="6996532">Because the Court in the -- in our decisions said, if -- it is not ready to say that either, that is the self-nomination procedure or the qualification standing alone would constitute a violation, and there I was lost at that moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1828.762" offset="7315017">If the eligibility requirements affect them, then following Judge Friendly's opinion -- Judge Friendly's approach as is clarified I think in Judge Lumbard's approach, then I would have the right as a nominator to say that I have been denied my right to nominate these other people, forget about myself now, these other people because the eligibility requirements are so severe as to disqualify them and thereby denying this right, the equal rights to nominate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1913.939" offset="7655654">Well, they would say, if this union that has a large influx of new members, is it a union where there are more men than jobs?</text>

            <text syncTime="1958.044" offset="7832137">And the Secretary of Labor would consider whether or not there are enough licensed marine engineers now in the industry which would indicate there's need for more.</text>

            <text syncTime="2181.154" offset="8724584">I obtained it Friday and I sir, gave a copy of it to my friend as quickly as I could which is yesterday morning at 11 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.901" offset="8759589">The plaintiffs in this case bring suit to protect the right to nominate candidates, not their right to be candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.400" offset="8785502">The record which that -- the complaint which is at pages 2 to 10 of the record, sets forth the provisions of the union constitution bylaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.026" offset="8820088">Most of which were suddenly imposed upon the members on the very eve of this -- of this election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.105" offset="8844330">I was about to say this last election, actually it's the first election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.635" offset="8858540">Since this low -- this union, this district, has never held a general election for officers before, all except two of the officers, two branch agents having been appointed to their office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.616" offset="8918413">The complaint alleges that the members' rights to nominate candidates and to vote for the candidates of their choice are being infringed by a set of provisions which with one hand prohibit them from nominating anybody other than themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.838" offset="8991347">And with the other hand, prohibit them from nominating themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.248" offset="9008901">The prohibition on nominating anybody other than themselves is in the bylaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.730" offset="9030844">The prohibitions of nominating themselves are in these new eligibility requirements which are not entirely as my friend stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.464" offset="9061773">For instance the eligibility rule for pre -- for the District Presidency and for the president -- the all national officers, the national is not a party here but it is of course related, is that the man -- the person to be nominated, that is the nominator under the bylaw, must have served as a paid full-time officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.280" offset="9153097">Thus, for instance, the elected treasurer, the former New York Local, the largest local in the union until it was dissolved in 1961 was declared ineligible as I noted in the footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.006" offset="9200013">I think Footnote 22 of my brief because his office was not a paid one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.518" offset="9222060">I might add although it's not in my brief that he had actually served as a paid member of the election's board for a few days, but that was not held suitable to make him eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.416" offset="9261662">The result of course of such a rule is to make it impossible for the -- for any member even if the bylaw weren't existing to nominate any but a handful of candidate -- choose from any but a handful of candidates, virtually all of them can be expected to be on the administration team.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.804" offset="9335118">It's not impossible in other words to put up a opposition slate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.234" offset="9352882">As per all other offices in the union, the candidate to be nominated or to nominate himself must have served 180 days of seatime for each of two years in the three years immediately preceding the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.826" offset="9423203">This requirement in other words, they just served to have half of each of two years, in the recent last two years, would eliminate a very large portion of the membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.296" offset="9461133">It's disputed in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.334" offset="9469283">The plaintiff's affidavit asserts that that it would eliminate approximately half the members from availability or from the power to nominate themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.742" offset="9502929">Well, the defendant's affidavit asserts that it would eliminate only about 25% of itself but it would nevertheless eliminate a substantial number just by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.502" offset="9545979">At any rate, these plaintiffs are -- and along with a great many of their fellow members are unable to nominate any candidate whatsoever for any office whatsoever and it's primarily of that prohibition of which that they complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.830" offset="9611285">Now, the issue here is not whether that's reasonable or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.494" offset="9633959">The Court of Appeals has held that it is unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.189" offset="9644722">Moreover, it would -- the Court of Appeals held that it would have been as such restrictions on the right to nominate, it would have been invalid at common law, long before the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act is passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.616" offset="9690384">However, the union has not petition for certiorari on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.552" offset="9710132">The union has come to this Court only the question of jurisdiction, claiming that even though these provisions do infringe the members' right to nominate candidates, still the Court had no jurisdiction to over a complaint aimed at attack -- attacking these restrictive provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.882" offset="9799471">I might add that after the Court of Appeals decided this case, the case was remanded to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.526" offset="9826011">The District Court then considered other defenses raised by the defendants, namely latches and the claimed failure of the plaintiffs' to exhaust all their internal union remedies, found these to be no barred to the complaint and issued a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.651" offset="9890586">There was no appeal taken from that decision so of course those matters are not before this Court either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.461" offset="9917753">The issues before them boils down as to whether provisions of the union constitution which deprived members of any of the rights set forth in Section 101 (a) (1), equal on democratic rights to vote, to nominate candidates, to consult.</text>

            <text syncTime="2594.177" offset="10376673">I want to say I don't know the future election will be held is apparent from the union's resistance to holding a new election in the district right now that they do not want to or the officials do not want to hold an election under these new provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.925" offset="10431634">As to the national election, that won't be held until 1968 and I doubt very much whether it would be very difficult for the officials to reamend the constitution in the meantime, to put it truly that it should be off.</text>

            <text syncTime="2645.091" offset="10580323">The treasurer had said of Local 33 in New York, the biggest local in the union, a former treasurer, had nominated himself for a national office.</text>

            <text syncTime="2722.012" offset="10888046">It says that it was our opinion that the Pacific Coast District case presents a more promising prospect for successful litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2916.472" offset="11665868">The problem of the rights of union members and especially in electoral rights of the union members has been a matter of considerable concern for a good many years to virtually anyone of -- who had -- who sides with and is friendly to the labor movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.156" offset="11728562">Organizations like the Civil Liberties Union and the Workers Defense League both of which are amici here beside, the Association of Cabinet Trade Unions have been active in this area pressing either for a voluntary Bill of Rights for union members and for voluntary review such as now exists in the United Automobile Workers, and also for federal legislation to protect the democratic rights of union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.365" offset="11849456">This is a problem which has grown up primarily as a result of the growth of an establishment inside some of the unions, a bureaucratic establishment, very much like the establishment exists in government and in large business corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.289" offset="11921136">And the problem of protecting union members has -- have been seen generally as a right of protecting them against the power of these establishment to oppress them within their union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.485" offset="11973904">The -- a very similar question or issue involved -- a similar issue came before this Court in the famous case of Steele against Louisville &amp; Nashville where this Court inquired into the powers of a union over an individual working man, subject to the collective bargaining agreement, subject to the powers that the collective bargaining agent had under -- on its -- under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.915" offset="12087589">This Court pointed out that the Act had conferred upon the collective bargaining representatives, a power similar to a legislative body to restrict or expand the rights of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.618" offset="12146416">And it pointed out that this implied a corresponding duty to protect the rights of individual members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.591" offset="12178286">In fact Justice Murphy went even further and said that there would be a serious constitutional question, if it were not to the fact -- if there were no power of the courts to protect the rights of individual members against the powers of the union leadership or the establishment to injure the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.551" offset="12266162">The same thing of course applies to intra-union rights and it's this area that which the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act attempted to go in order to protect the rights of members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.618" offset="12330423">The history of the Act makes clear I think what the purpose of the Bill of Rights was and the provision under which we're dealing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.810" offset="12371174">The Act as you know begins with a -- as Your Honors, begins with the recognition that the state decisions had provided a substantial measure of pre-election protection of union members' democratic rights but had provided only inadequate protection after the election for abuses which occurred during the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.186" offset="12464692">So, when the Act is originally drafted and the committee originally dealt with in March -- February of 1959, it provided a new post-election remedy that is, that it conferred upon the Secretary of Labor, the power in certain instances to set aside the results of an election and order a new one where a violation had occurred and where the violation was so serious as to affect -- as probably to affect the outcome of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.618" offset="12606380">But the -- but even the drafts of the original bill were very careful to preserve all existing pre-election remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.024" offset="12636056">Now, these pre-election remedies, being state remedies had been brought -- had been based on the theory of contract, that the union constitution is a contract between the members of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.646" offset="12674508">As a practical matter, many of the cases went beyond anything said in the union constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.945" offset="12695719">I have cited several cases, several New York cases in my brief and two of them are (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.140" offset="12720483">There was nothing whatever in the contract to the -- of the constitution that was a much help to the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.668" offset="12742635">But the courts there as the courts have elsewhere, read the union constitution in the light of the democratic purposes of unionism itself and in the light as Justice Hammer said, if the -- of the -- free traditions of a free people proud of their democratic heritage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.326" offset="12821211">And in that light, it gave protection to the members' rights to have an election and have the election fairly conducted, inducing the Court set forth an elaborate series of protections which should be carried out including the use of -- not including the use of voting machines but the appellate division -- modified to inquire -- require the use of voting machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.322" offset="12913267">The -- at any rate the bill as it reached the Senate reported out by the committee provided a post-election remedy and was -- and protected all existing state pre-election remedies, but the Senate found this inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.455" offset="12973767">Essentially, the Senate took the position that there should be a federal pre-election remedy and it's for that reason that the Senate undertook to add a Bill of Rights to the bill as it -- as the bill reached it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.331" offset="13033221">Now, the Senate passed one Bill of Rights, was unsatisfied with it and passed another Bill of Rights, the Kuchel substitute and this -- even the substitute went -- underwent some modification later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.766" offset="13083063">But the clear purpose of the Bill of Rights was to protect -- was to provide direct relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.236" offset="13104901">Under the Kuchel amendment, it became enforceable at the suit of the member himself where union members' democratic rights including the rights to nominate candidates and to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.806" offset="13163207">Now, I've said that I would get in a moment and I'll try to take -- make just a moment into comparing the pre right -- the pre-election rights to nominate candidates with the post-election Title IV rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.268" offset="13217019">I've said that the Title IV remedy is inadequate and I'd like to list the reasons why.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.765" offset="13234991">First of all, because it is a post-election remedy and here I refer to the quotations in my brief and in the Workers Defense League's brief from a study reported by Professor Clyde Summers in the a law journal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.329" offset="13297267">The reason why I regard that article as important as it is, is that it is the result of a study commissioned by the New York legislature, the Labor and Management Improper Practices Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.017" offset="13348049">Of all New York cases reported and unreported, most of them unrep -- of course unreported, dealing with internal union affairs and internal union elections, the report there covered several hundred cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.398" offset="13405518">It involved -- is to be subject so they're in the records that involved discussions with the lawyers who are active in most of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.466" offset="13437806">The conclusions which Professor Summers reached and which the committee -- which the official reporter reached where that pre-election remedies were the only ones of any practical value, post-election remedies were utterly unsatisfactory because they provided no -- too little protection to the members since they came so late and too much burden to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.477" offset="13533832">Post-election remedy after all involved the setting aside of an election, the throwing of the question of the entire structure of the union as to who is going to be -- who is entitled to be the leader of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.899" offset="13575523">It involved exacerbating any factional struggle which may exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.857" offset="13595376">And it involves the expense and nuisance of an election that recalled for by the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.585" offset="13626305">That is one reason for instance why in all of the New York cases that Professor Summers came across, he find only one in which such a post-election remedy was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.673" offset="13666638">And that was a case where the officials where accused of very serious financial misdealing and a new election was necessary to protect the treasury from being dissipated entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.539" offset="13714077">In all other cases, the Court -- in all the other post-election cases, the Court has found some reason or rather -- were not moving.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.744" offset="13750962">Instantly on that point and in making that point, I'd like withdraw any inference that I have -- that may have been improper activity in -- the secretary is not moving against the national union while it did move against the Pacific Coast district election, this is a problem which confronts anybody who attempts to upset an election already taken place because of its seriousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.707" offset="13842808">In fact, I've cited one case where the Court went in to this very question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.589" offset="13858273">This is Ford against Kearns where the claim was that the union president had used the union newspaper to campaign for reelection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.255" offset="13888993">The Court very clearly said that it was the duty of the complaining member to bring suit before the election that since the complaining member waited until the election occurred and then brought suit to the very extreme relief of offsetting the election, therefore no relief were -- that the election would not be upset.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.736" offset="13970913">That of course is the prime reason and the most important reason why a Title IV remedy is inadequate standing by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.674" offset="13998602">The Title IV remedy is better than the remedy that it took -- was place it took, namely the state post-election remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.866" offset="14023367">But it's not adequate to fill the bill as far as whole remedies are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.277" offset="14041025">Another remedy is again the power of the bureaucratic establishments which has gone up as I say inside many unions to make its influence felt within the Sec -- the Department of Labor, so that as in the rank and file union members seize it, when he appeals to the Secretary of Labor to set aside the results of the election, he's appealing in a sense, in a large sense, to his enemies' ally to protect him against his enemy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3545.432" offset="14181669">I know that's how a great many members see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.672" offset="14198596">The -- pardon me, I think I'd mention one reason by -- I believe a Title IV remedy is inadequate as a single remedy protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.022" offset="14256065">The remedy itself takes approximately two years or maybe longer to effectuate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.164" offset="14292637">Under the Act, the members require an exhaust remedies for three months at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.417" offset="14313639">After the election was taken place, he then goes to the Secretary of Labor and that process takes 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.759" offset="14334955">The Secretary of Labor if he then -- if he decides to move, then files a suit which will take anywhere from one or two or -- years or longer to end its way to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.427" offset="14381662">Now in the course of that time, it's entirely likely that the term of office would have expired and new election would have been held, it will be about to be held, and the case in all important respects will have -- become new moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.029" offset="14432026">We'll be dealing with new violations by the time the case comes down, not within the old ones, will be no longer of any importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.665" offset="14462642">There are some instances in which the Secretary of Labor is able, despite this time limitation, to provide some kind of a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.442" offset="14493675">But there are many other instances whereas remedy would be ineffectual entirely, simply because of the impossibility of getting to trial until the current terms of office had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.367" offset="14549368">I want to emphasize that Congress did not view the Title IV remedy as a sole reliance at any rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.763" offset="14586984">Even the drafters of the bill saw a dual protection for democratic rights in the union elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.890" offset="14615510">The pre-election remedy which they regarded first as a state remedy, and secondly, the post-election Title IV remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.722" offset="14642887">When they came to the matter, they saw merely that one -- that one of these two remedies was inadequate as it existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.458" offset="14665770">So they replaced the state post-election remedy with a federal post-election remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.148" offset="14688549">When the matter got to the Court and to the Senate, the Senate decided to build up the other avenue of protection by providing a federal pre-election remedy to supplement and go along with the state pre-election remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.635" offset="14750511">To knock down half of what Congress built, namely the pre-election remedies, would be to emasculate the Act and to leave only the weakest of the protection standard which Congress sought to create.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.504" offset="14813936">That's why primarily, I want to contend that if it were held as this -- as the petitioner is asking this Court that there is no jurisdiction in advancing an election, no jurisdiction under Title I to protect democratic rights to the members, then these extremely valuable rights, the right to vote for candidate of one's choice, which this Court only last June in Reynolds against Sims held that the essence of the democratic society, then these democratic rights would have no real protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.206" offset="14964820">It will only have a very uncertain long delayed and inadequate possibility of protection under Title IV of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3755.348" offset="15021349">First, I'd like to clarify the situation as it affects the question by Mr. Justice Goldberg on the status of the election itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.929" offset="15071713">Actually the ballots have been impounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.825" offset="15091252">They are now in the possession of the Clerk of the District Court awaiting determination of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.008" offset="15127928">In the event, it is found that the District Court had no jurisdiction then obviously those ballots would be counted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.501" offset="15165962">If it was held otherwise, then we go on to another stage of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.127" offset="15184457">And that was arranged for by the way when I made an application to Mr. Justice Harlan for a stay, and my adversary and I, before Mr. Justice Harlan were able to come to that understanding so that we preserved the res and otherwise we -- that had not been done, we would not have a subject matter to preserve if there were reversal by this Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Scribner</label>
            <text syncTime="3825.080" offset="15300232">Oh, yes indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.200" offset="15316741">Now with the reference to Professor Clyde Summers interests me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.281" offset="15337117">The position of the respondents actually and of the amici who is supporting respondents is really not in full reliance on the Second Circuit's decisions or reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.851" offset="15387376">In fact, it appears that they distrust the full validity of the decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.862" offset="15415380">They rely now on something else and that is what Professor Summers has suggested and which has been rejected in every court, District Court that has heard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.888" offset="15467520">And that is that Section 401 (e) not only allows for post-election remedies but also allows for pre-election remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.238" offset="15528856">It's a sort of thing where it's tidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.783" offset="15539096">Section 401, if you have a problem under Section 401, the member wants to go into the District Court, well, he may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.510" offset="15570024">On the other hand if after an election, then you go to the Secretary of Labor and it creates a sort of tidiness which is wholly out of keeping with what the Congress said because there is no question that insofar as 401 (e) rights are concerned, they must go the Secretary of Labor and they can only go after an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.682" offset="15654661">As a matter -- the proof of that is in an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.565" offset="15670230">That exception was provided on the very day that the Bill of Rights was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.814" offset="15695203">No, that the culture amendment was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.194" offset="15708682">What happened there was as they were considering the amendment, that is the Bill of Rights as amended by Senator Kuchel on April 25th, 1959, Senator Javits presented a different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.148" offset="15764584">He said, "Let's make sure that we give the right of a member, of a candidate rather, to have equal treatment in respect to the distribution of campaign material".</text>
            <text syncTime="3957.627" offset="15830413">And they adopted on that day an amendment to Title IV which provided that in that particular instant and by the way in no other instance in the Title IV may a candidate go directly to the District Court without going to the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.478" offset="15909825">In other words, we have proof -- simple proof of the rule by the one exception that was permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.235" offset="15932918">Now, the attitude taken by Professor Clyde Summers has been as I said considered by the other courts, and I said it's an interesting suggestion that might be quite tidy but it happens not to be what the legislature has provided, and -- oh, yes, we referred to that affirmance that referred to -- in the decision of the Court of Appeals as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.851" offset="16043363">As a matter of fact, the Court of Appeals here refers to it and says, “Gives the attitude to the court's honor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.570" offset="16066247">And says that issue was not the way it was -- it was not the way it was considered certainly by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.837" offset="16083278">They did not adopt it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.609" offset="16090384">Now -- and just one other item and I close with that, it's hardly my function to protect the integrity of the Secretary of Labor at this point based on what has been said about him a little while ago.</text>
