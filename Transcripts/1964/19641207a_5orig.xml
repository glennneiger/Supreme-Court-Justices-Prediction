            <text syncTime="119.058" offset="476160">In 1947 in this case this Court ruled in decree that California was not the owner of the submerged lands lying seaward of the ordinary low water mark and outside of the inland waters of the State and that the United States was possessed a paramount of rights in and full dominion and power over those submerged lands including minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.649" offset="554527">Pursuant to the reserved jurisdiction of the Court, a Special Master was appointed to aid the Court in ascertaining the low water mark and the outer limits of the inland waters along several segments of the California coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.099" offset="604369">In the final reference, the Special Master was asked to submit his recommended answers as to three questions dealing with seven specified coastal segments.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.510" offset="638015">The questions were as follows, One, what is the status inland waters or open sea are particular channels and other water areas between the mainland and offshore islands and if inland waters then by what criteria are the inland water limits of any such channel or other water areas to be determined?</text>
            <text syncTime="180.361" offset="721398">Two, are particular segments in back bays or harbors constituting inland waters and from what landmarks of the lines marking the seaward limits of bays, harbors, rivers, and other inland waters to be drawn?</text>
            <text syncTime="192.914" offset="771553">And three, by what criteria did the ordinary low water mark in coast of California to be ascertained?</text>
            <text syncTime="200.792" offset="803109">After holding hearings the Special Master filed his Report in the fall of 1952 wherein he concluded in general that none of the said seven segments under consideration constituted inland waters or bays although the Master did hold that areas behind artificial harbor were constituted inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.382" offset="877505">Both parties filed exceptions to this report.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.765" offset="1767027">Just to comment on that a little bit further, the Master took the position that much of the evidence referred by California before the Master was not relevant because considerations of state department practice in United States Foreign Relations were determinative of the result in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.865" offset="1839438">This Court, we believe, has found otherwise in the case of United States versus Louisiana and has found that the matter was a domestic matter and that the matter should be governed by the question of the division of the continental seabed between the nation and the State as it's worded in that case and that being a domestic matter, a different criteria must be applied and different factual material is therefore relevant and I think an examination of the Master's Report itself will indicate that this is true.</text>

            <text syncTime="649.587" offset="2598348">In 1953, Congress passed the Submerged Lands Act which in general restored to the coastal States of the submerged lands lying within their boundaries subject to specific limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.961" offset="2639830">In the same year, Congress enacted the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act which provided the development by the Federal Government of that portion of the continental shelf lying seaward of the area restored to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.488" offset="2685910">The entire continental shelf of course had previously by the Truman Proclamation of 1945 been declared to have been up to -- appertain to and then the subject of the jurisdiction of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.636" offset="2738469">In 1963, the plaintiff pursuant to an order in this Court filed a supplement complaint which noted the passage of the Submerged Lands Act in 1953 and which sought a decree declaring the extent of the ownership of the United States in the continental shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.391" offset="2797505">Additionally, the Government asked the court to rule on the exceptions to the Special Master's Report previously filed by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.587" offset="2826344">Last December, this Court entered an order allowing the parties to file additional exceptions and briefs in support thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.951" offset="2855706">This has been done and we're here today to argue the original exceptions and also the additional exceptions which were filed last -- earlier this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.780" offset="2895099">California's basic position is as follows, It is a State of California's main contention of the Submerged Lands Act has completely destroyed the basic premise upon which the Special Master based his Report by converting the nature of this case from one of paramount rights and foreign relations of United States to an interpretation of the intent of Congress in restoring to the States the submerged lands within their historic boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.121" offset="3004395">The Special Master as well as the parties during the proceedings prior to1953 believed and I quote from the Report of the Master at page 6, "That the determination of the demarcation line at which inland waters end and the marginal sea begins also determine the exterior limit of the marginal belt, and therefore involved a question of a territorial jurisdiction of the United States as against foreign nations i.e. a question of external sovereignty."</text>
            <text syncTime="781.274" offset="3125081">With the passage of the Submerged Lands Act this determination, we believe, became one of domestic concern exclusively as was pointed out in 1960 Louisiana decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.713" offset="3174818">Because of this fundamental change in the nature of the case, California believes that the Report of the Special Master in general is no longer applicable to this controversy and this Court must re-determine the answers to the questions posed to the Special Master in light of intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.279" offset="3237094">The Federal Government, however, despite the Louisiana decision and its own statements that the apportionment of the sea beds and subsoil of the continental shelf between the nation and the States is a purely domestic matter, continues to characterize this case as one involving the foreign policy of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.603" offset="3306371">Before delving into the intent of Congress, we would like to illustrate the positions of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.156" offset="3324552">We have prepared a series of charts and photographs, individual copies of which have been presented to each member of the Court which portray the segments of the California coast and dispute before the Special Master but with the claims of the party as changed by the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.264" offset="3392993">The first area we proposed to discuss or to illustrate briefly is the area of bays.</text>

            <text syncTime="2654.058" offset="10616163">In terms of the way the decision was -- came down, they probably were not any good except possibly with respect to the definition of inland waters and again, that would only be possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.648" offset="10658586">We claim that with respect to the situation as it now exists under the Submerged Lands Act and considering the history of the Submerged Lands Act the Congress made it clear that it wished the determination of inland waters and the nature of inland waters to be determined primarily by the prior cases of this Court decided, prior to first the United States versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.751" offset="10754926">Basically, in effect going back to the rule of Pollard's Lessee versus Hagan to determine what were or were not inland waters and this was so stated I have a few quotations here on the floor and in the Committee with respect to the intent of Congress in passing the Act and how inland waters were to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.227" offset="10844891">Now, if the resolution of this dispute depends primarily, we contend in the intent of Congress both parties agree that Congress in exercising its constitutional power to dispose a federal property could have divided the continental shelf between the nations and States in anyway it saw fit, and that the dispute over the extent of that division depends upon the intent of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.367" offset="10929424">The parties also agree that with the Truman Proclamation in 1945 the entire continental shelf came under the jurisdiction of the United States and the division of shelf between federal and the State governments involves a purely domestic matter in no wise affecting the international relations of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.737" offset="10998909">We say that this Court has already ruled in the second Louisiana case in the basic intent of the Congress and enacting the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.251" offset="11029002">The test, we contend, that should be applied in ascertaining the extent of the division is one of the state's boundaries upon admission, not U.S. foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.697" offset="11070694">In the Louisiana case, the Court noted that the fixing of a state's boundaries as a function of Congress and cannot be fixed by executive action and we have cited certain cases with respect thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.908" offset="11127536">The legislative history of the Submerged Lands Act shows that Congress intended the division of the continental shelf to be in terms of state historic boundaries and not to be effective or affected by United States international relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.148" offset="11180513">The Report of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and the numerous statements of the author Senator Holland and the Senate Floor Manager Senator Cordon, the Senate Majority Leader and the other leading supporters of the Act leave no doubt as to the purpose and intent of Congress in enacting this legislation, namely to modify the prior decision on this case and to restore to the state's ownership of the submerged lands within their historic boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.718" offset="11274867">For example, we have quoted from a senate community Report that appears in our opening brief at page 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.832" offset="11303288">The purpose of this legislation is to write the law for the future as the Supreme Court believed it to be in the past that the State shall own and have proprietary use of all lands under navigable waters within their territorial jurisdiction whether inland or seaward, subject only to the governmental powers delegated to the United States by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.619" offset="11390433">Senator Holland also stated and this quotation appears in the government's answering in brief at page 20, “This joint resolution will confirm to the maritime state of which there are 20, the rights which they had respectively enjoyed since the founding of our nation and up to the date of the decision in the California case in their offshore lands and waters which lie within their constitutional boundaries.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.216" offset="11496803">Their quotations in similar vein from Senator Holland, Senator Cordon, Senator Daniel, Senator Taft and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.678" offset="11526687">As Texas pointed out in its brief in the second Louisiana case determines historic state boundaries original boundaries and for additional state boundaries were used over 1,000 times throughout the legislative history of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.213" offset="11580813">And there can be no doubt that Congress spring the Act in terms of restoring to the States the submerged lands within the State boundaries at the time of admission to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.800" offset="11623131">In addition, there is no doubt that Congress was aware that it was dealing with a domestic matter and not with a question of foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.211" offset="11652807">Now, this particular point was made clear by the testimony of Deputy State Department Legal Adviser Tate before the Senate Committee and his testimony in turn was later quoted on the Senate floor.1</text>

            <text syncTime="3364.216" offset="13456823">One of the reasons given for this amendment by Senator Cordon the Acting Chairman was that, “It was sought not to get into that field because you were in appeal then where in our attempts to take care of a purely domestic matter, we might be putting the United States on record with a president which we intended only to apply domestically but which might be applied internationally.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.692" offset="13554730">As we have pointed out in our closing brief, attempts were made once in committee and for or five times in the floor of the Senate and the House to frame the acts in terms of or by reference the United States Foreign Relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.148" offset="13600496">The Congress did not accept any of these proposals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.168" offset="13612617">Many reasons can be given for the defeat of each proposal but the important point is that these attempts to frame or limit the Act by reference to criteria other than historic boundaries were uniformly rejected by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.289" offset="13661100">In some then we say, that the Congress knew that it was dealing with domestic matter and framed the Submerged Lands Act by reference to a State historic boundaries and not by reference, the State Department practiced in 1850 in 1953 or now.</text>

            <text syncTime="3776.528" offset="15106090">Therefore, they argue the criteria for ascertaining the location of this baseline are to be determined by United States Foreign Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.143" offset="15136496">The United States however shows no support for the conclusion which obviously runs counter to the basic philosophy of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.404" offset="15165544">The effect of the government's position is to have the extent of built up land restored to the States determined by State Department practice since fixing the baseline by such practice, obviously, fixes the extent of the area restored.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.361" offset="15221342">If Congress has clearly intended that it did not intend such a result and the Court is rejected such an approach in the second Louisiana case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.490" offset="15253943">An examination of the legislative history of the Act, shows that Congress rejected using U.S. Foreign Relations as the criteria for establishing the baseline under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.611" offset="15294380">This was most notably shown when the Senate Committee and Executives' session amended the definition of inland waters to exclude the phrase quote “Which includes estuaries, ports, harbors, bays, channels, straits, historic bays and all other bodies of water which join the open sea.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.232" offset="15360836">The Senate Committee Report in commenting on this amendment stated then I quote this is the Senate Report at page 18 and our brief at pages 21 and 22, “The elimination of the language in the Committee's opinion is consistent with the velocity of the Holland bill to place the States in the position in which both they and the Federal Government thought they were for more than a century-and-a-half and not to create any situation with respect thereto.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.406" offset="15465535">During the Committee debates in this amendment, Senator Long expressed fear of having a State Department determine whether certain areas constituted inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.265" offset="15496986">Some of the other Senators clearly indicated that this was not of the intent of the bill, for example, Senator Cordon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.115" offset="15520392">This quotation approves that pages 27 and 28 of the second volume of our opening brief, “The elimination of the language still follows what the chair understands to be the philosophy of the bill, that we are putting the States where they thought they were and not attempting now to create either a situation in law or a basis for a rule of evidence that may or may not have been sound when the States came into the Union.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.375" offset="15617463">I believe that the elimination of the language does that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.106" offset="15628330">I believe that it will not prejudice any State in account of anything in this bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.480" offset="15645884">It may not do as good a job for some State as it would have the Congress legislatively met the State's contention and agreed with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.324" offset="15673260">But as I understand it, what we seek to do is neither to agree nor to disagree but to announce legislatively that we seek to place to place the States in the position the States believe themselves to be in prior to the California decision and to leave to them at the same time every remedy in the courts of this country that they then had or thought they had with reference to what they thought was theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.613" offset="15766361">And then there is a comment by Senator Daniel which we've also quoted second volume of our opening brief page 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.630" offset="15794469">Senator Daniel, “Mr. Chairman, I would vote for Senator Long's amendment of his offer by I agreed fully with the Chairman that the striking these words was not done in any manner to prejudice the rights of the States and that the effect would not be to bind this to the boxed formula or anybody else in this formula.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.287" offset="15861133">I just want to state for the record if this record is ever used in the future and the final comment by Senator Anderson Volume II of our opening brief at page 34, “I subscribe fully to what the Chairman said quite awhile ago in pointing out that this bill does not seek to take away from our add to the position of these States as they came into the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.531" offset="15950054">Now, it's obvious from these expressions of underlying philosophy that Congress intended historic criteria to govern the baseline established by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.032" offset="15984118">Now, these historic criteria, we contend, are not affected in any way by the United States Foreign Policy as of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.864" offset="16019435">Now, relating the baseline and particularly inland waters to historic criteria, it must mean those water areas the States considered to be part of their territory when they were admitted into the Union excluding of course the marginal belt, those areas over which the -- in other words those areas over which the States have historically exercised jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.021" offset="16104072">Again, to quote Senator Holland, this appears in the testimony before Senate Committee in the 1953 hearings at page 48 and I quote, “But the language of the bill is perfectly clear and that it is the constitutional boundaries and it is the historic boundaries and it is a case of restoration and establishment to the States of what lie within their boundaries or jurisdiction, a criminal law and a various other kinds of laws boundaries which fix the venues of cases which arise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.349" offset="16229355">Now, the validity of a State's historic boundaries, we say, should not be tested by some technical and changing criteria devised by the State Department which may be valid for international relations but which have no bearing on federal-state relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.219" offset="16288810">When questioned during the senate hearings about the location of the coastline in inland waters, Senator Cordon stated and this appears in our closing brief pages 22 and 23 and Footnote 9, “The matter if inland waters are one which has been defined time and time again by the courts not I believe in one all inclusive definition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4094.759" offset="16378984">In committee hearing, Senator Cordon also stated and this is the 1953 hearing at page 1384, “There is no question in the Chairman's mind that is that we are not bound by any opinion, expert or otherwise, that is not comprehended in the statutes of the United States or in the decisions of its courts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.893" offset="16459546">I have already read Senator Anderson's comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.698" offset="16478772">Now, to contrast with this is the position of the Special Masters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.407" offset="16501551">He framed his recommended answers on the premise that the issues would be determined by reference to United States Foreign Relations and external sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.631" offset="16538436">As I have already pointed out, I have already pointed this out but I would like to read a quote from his Report, it appears in Volume I of our opening brief at page 34.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.859" offset="16579396">He states, “Under these circumstances adjudication of the status of the water areas here in controversy must depend upon whether there has been effective assertion by the United States and its international relations of the criteria proposed by California.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.515" offset="16641985">And as I believe we've already pointed out, this not a test which appears in the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.551" offset="16666122">Now, the Special Master also noted and this is at page 39 of this Report that the evidence concerning the geography, the history and the economic importance of the water area in dispute would have been relevant if there had been any assertion of exclusive jurisdiction of these waters by or on behalf of the United States, but under his approach, the evidence was considered irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.161" offset="16760581">In view of the purpose of the Submerge Lands Act and Senator Holland's remarks concerning historic boundaries and boundaries of jurisdiction, this evidence, we believe, is now relevant and critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.019" offset="16804049">Consequently, we believe that the Special Master's Report is not an appropriate vehicle for resolving the present dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.949" offset="16831739">In this regard, we believe, that the evidence presented to the Special Master and any additional evidence which would now be relevant under the change rules applicable should and must be reevaluated in light of the proper criteria to be applied under the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.751" offset="16898926">As far as the basic concerned, however, we believe that all of the evidence principles and legal materials necessary are before this Court and that this aspect of the case can be disposed of now.</text>

            <text syncTime="5176.105" offset="20704340">Now, the case of Santa Monica Bay is similar to the case of San Pedro Bay and the case of the People versus Stralla lays down what we think a sound test for determining whether or not particular bays should be considered as bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="5193.157" offset="20772571">And this Court says, is the body of water of bay geographically, is it a bay historically, and is it a bay legally?</text>
            <text syncTime="5200.108" offset="20800366">In this case, the Court answered all the question in the affirmative and this was again a question of criminal jurisdiction and the application of criminal law in this particular area of the bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.468" offset="20845819">Now, on leaving this point, I would like to call the courts attention to the fact that these cases, all these California cases are tied together directly to the early 1793 opinion of Attorney General Randolph with respect for Delaware Bay and 1882 opinion of the Commissioners on Alabama Claims with respect to the waters of Chesapeake Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="5232.573" offset="20930247">And we further believe these cases, these California cases are among the cases to which Senators Holland, Cordon, Long, and Anderson referred when they spoke of inland waters having been defined by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5244.210" offset="20976744">We say that the Congress did not intend to adopt any technical criteria when it defined the coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.042" offset="21000150">When applied to the California coast, the Submerged Lands Act encompassed the historic and constitutional boundary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5256.716" offset="21026795">This boundary uses the term bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="5259.124" offset="21036408">It must be concluded that Congress intended that as to California, all those bodies of water which have always been considered bays constitute inland waters within the meaning of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5271.505" offset="21085936">Now, returning to our island boundary, historically as we have shown in our briefs, the water areas between the mainland and the Southern California islands were subject the jurisdiction of Spain and Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="5283.451" offset="21133793">The California Supreme Court in the Ocean Industries case carefully appraised this history of Spanish and Mexican control over the coast, seas, and adjacent islands, and the Court pointed out that this area of jurisdiction was ceded by Mexico to United States by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848.</text>
            <text syncTime="5301.648" offset="21206518">As the Federal Court noted in United States versus Carrillo, this area became part of California under the Constitution of 1849.</text>
            <text syncTime="5310.109" offset="21240372">We also contend that the constitutional boundary description was provided for a seaward boundary from the Mexican border and I quote, “Running in the northwesterly direction and following the direction of the Pacific Coast,” and the final phrase, “Also all islands along and adjacent to the Pacific Coast.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.728" offset="21318844">In light of the history of the area means, that the intervening waters are part of California and are inland waters within the meaning purpose intended the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.099" offset="21356356">As we pointed out in our brief, these phrases were selected from several alternative boundary descriptions and then a total context of the history of the area and intent of constitutional convention must construed as we contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="5351.885" offset="21407451">The United States insist that California has never prior to this case claimed jurisdiction over this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5358.261" offset="21432947">We point out that the Special Master noted that in 1939, the brief of the State of California filed with the California Supreme Court in the People versus Stralla, asserted that the water area lying easterly of the islands is within the boundaries of the State of California as appears to the Master's Report at page 37.</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.228" offset="21500865">Of course, the Court in that case was concerned with Santa Monica Bay and not the overall unit, so was not required to rule on the assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5383.133" offset="21532526">The Court did however rule and I quote in 14 Cal.2d at 633 “That the jurisdiction of the State extends over the waters of Santa Monica Bay and at least for a distance of three miles oceanward from that line.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5397.224" offset="21588846">Finally in our closing brief, we presented an analysis of the federal land mass which were published in 1885 in which I have discussed previously which we also say are consistent with California's interpretation of its constitutional boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5410.841" offset="21643285">In summary, we put on this point we believe that historic boundaries, state boundaries, boundaries of county jurisdiction and criminal fish jurisdiction represent the factors to which Senator Holland referred and which must be considered in determining whether an area constitutes inland waters within the meaning of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5428.188" offset="21712666">I would like to reserve the rest of my time.</text>

            <label>Mr. George N. Hayes</label>
            <text syncTime="5455.401" offset="21821544">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court, I'm counsel for United States and the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.600" offset="21850384">Oh, thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="5471.990" offset="21887896">Our position here is with reverence to one point only and it does not concern itself with all of the claims of California or other replies or claims of the United States with the regard to those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="5487.001" offset="21947977">We are here merely on the question of whether or not when the United States Executive enlarges upon the juridical bay whether or not that and your to the benefit of the several States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5500.844" offset="22003357">In going on to that, I think that despite what has been said in all our briefs about international law, international law is not directly pertinent in here and the only place it isn't relevant, it may be pertinent in that United States coastal seaward boundaries and state seaward boundaries have always been identical in the past and in that respect it may be pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5528.643" offset="22114534">Otherwise, it isn't relevant nor is the Submerged Lands Act relevant in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5537.284" offset="22149120">I think that what is important in determining whether or not California is to be the given the benefit of the present United States recognized juridical bay that is one that's closed by land 24 miles or not we have to look at what the Congress did when it admitted California into the Union, the Act of Admission and the intent of Congress at that time as interpreted by the courts and as affected by the development of the law after that and in fact during that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5574.532" offset="22298122">When Congress admitted California, it didn't say anything in the Act of Admission as to whether or not bays were included that is geographical bays or as to whether or not juridical bays which is less than a geographical bay it's the bay within the natural bay that is made by virtue of the sovereign saying, we're not going to recognize our sovereignty seaward of a certain line.</text>
            <text syncTime="5597.805" offset="22391118">Today, it's a 24 miles and in 1953 it was 10 miles, before that it was six miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="5607.720" offset="22430824">The California Constitution includes bays and the Act of Admission seems to adopt the California Constitution and from what counsel for California have presented, it seems to indicate that the framers of the California Constitution thought of bays in terms of a geographical bay not a juridical bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="5629.743" offset="22518909">However, going beyond that point which may be pertinent only to California but going beyond that point to a point which is important to us and California, I want to just cite to the Court what writers of the day indicated what was meant when the word “bays” was referred to generally and just two very brief statements, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5657.779" offset="22631027">One is by Secretary of State Buchanan and he made the statement as appears in the California brief on page 54 with his background, the United States Secretary of State Buchanan statement of January 23, 1849, one year before the admission of California is illuminating, “The exclusive jurisdiction of a nation extends to the ports, harbors, bays, mouths of rivers, and adjacent parts of the sea enclosed by headlands.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.344" offset="22781283">Now, in addition to that, that was said in 1849.</text>
            <text syncTime="5700.325" offset="22801241">In 1910, the permanent Court of arbitration pronounced or rather spoke of what men and governments considered when the word “bay” was used and they said as Mr. Keatinge quoted, “Now considering that the treaty may refer into Anglo-American Treaty, what the treaty that the treaty used the general term bays without qualification as did the California Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5726.648" offset="22906567">The tribunal is of the opinion that these words of the treaty must be interpreted in a general sense as applying to every bay on the coast in question that might reasonably suppose to have been considered as a bay by the negotiators of the treaty under the general conditions and prevailing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5745.391" offset="22981486">The negotiators of the Treaty of 1818 did probably not trouble themselves with subtle theories concerning the notion of bays.</text>
            <text syncTime="5754.402" offset="23017535">They most probably thought that everybody would know what was a bay?</text>
            <text syncTime="5759.880" offset="23039478">In this popular sense, the term must be interpreted in the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5764.551" offset="23058181">And Your Honor, I think what they meant by the most -- what everybody would think of when they thought of bays is this landlocked waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5773.893" offset="23095484">Waters that go into the land of a sovereign and are imposed by the land of that single sovereign and that is most probably what California had in mind and what Congress had in mind when they admitted California into the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5792.244" offset="23168940">But let's assume they didn't and that Congress had in mind something less than a geographical bay which is landward of the natural entrance point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5801.875" offset="23207497">Let's assume that Congress had in mind a juridical bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="5807.075" offset="23228291">Then the question comes up, what kind of juridical bay?</text>
            <text syncTime="5813.382" offset="23253473">A juridical bay that's defined by a 10-mile closure, a 24-mile closure or a six-mile closure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5823.960" offset="23295791">They couldn't have been thinking of 10, they had no idea at that time or no very good idea, I would say, that we would go to 10 but let's say that they might have been thinking of 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="5833.843" offset="23335288">If they were thinking of 10, they certainly might have thought that someday the United States would extend its juridical bay further out to sea than 10 and in fact we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="5843.554" offset="23374158">The only thing that was in existence at that time by way of a juridical bay was a six-mile closure line, in 1850, and that six-mile closure line went on a clear past the turn of this century.</text>
            <text syncTime="5860.101" offset="23440300">So if all Congress meant to give to the territorial limits of California was a juridical bay it must have been a six-mile bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="5870.395" offset="23481574">And yet Your Honors, the United States is not contending and wouldn't contend for a minute that all this Court should define is being within the territory of California is all those landward of a six-mile line and really for good reason they don't because it isn't the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5890.180" offset="23560673">It isn't what Congress intended to do back in the day when it admitted California.</text>
            <text syncTime="5900.032" offset="23600065">The law has developed and the law is simply this and while the Submerged Lands isn't necessary to show this to the Court and while the Submerged Lands Act has nothing to do with it directly as it was written, the legislative history of the Submerged Lands Act does help illuminate us on this point and the law is this that Congress can be considered to have meant a juridical bay but a juridical bay they must have known was a bay that didn't have any fixed line that a juridical bay is subject to changing of a fixed line.</text>
            <text syncTime="5937.416" offset="23749590">It's a dynamic thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5938.536" offset="23754083">It's not a static thing and that's what Congress meant when they were talking about establishing a line in a Submerged Lands Act that would define inland waters, demarcate inland waters from high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5951.150" offset="23804552">They said, “We will leave this matter where we found it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5955.573" offset="23822211">They were thinking at one time of using the word “bays” and as the Court will recall, the intention of Congress whatever the result actually was in the Submerged Lands Act, the intention of Congress was to do this was to give the States back the territorial sea, the three-mile belt and the to make very sure that the doctrine that was enunciated by this Court in U.S.A. versus California was not sign of things to come and he went on and he talked about other navigable inland waters and they talked about the entire bay and at the suggestion of the U.S. State Department that pointed out to them, that these concepts had changed and they were subject to change and that it would embarrass the United States if Congress would try include a whole bay if Congress withdrew but by withdrawing didn't mean that they intended to establish that in so far as any State was concerned Washington or Alaska or California that its inland waters would be fixed by 10 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="6020.194" offset="24080718">If that had any validity, the United States would be cleaning here today that no one of the several coastal states could have any greater inland waters than a line that was drawn or could have been drawn at the time it was admitted into the Union.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="7579.436" offset="30317714">But I think I can explain the main issues and that's really what I wanted to try to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="7584.966" offset="30339762">The easiest most convenient springboard is the decision of this Court in United States versus California the original case where the Court held that United States had title to the three-mile strip known as territorial waters or the marginal sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="7605.641" offset="30422518">It also determined in the decree entered at that ruling that the United States more specifically owned the three or had proprietary rights, paramount rights, in a three-mile strip beginning at the ordinary low water mark where the sea meets the mainland and beginning outside of inland ones waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="7635.103" offset="30540382">Those two components of course make up what we now call the coastline and what's described as the coastline in the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7645.312" offset="30581238">Just where this three-mile strip to which our title was quiet was left undefined except as the Court used those terms, outer limit of inland waters or outside inland waters and ordinary low water.</text>
            <text syncTime="7662.487" offset="30649887">But now the consequences of course of that was that the farther out California could push the outer limit of inland waters the more oil she would get to put it specifically, and the farther in we could push them, the more oil we would get.</text>
            <text syncTime="7679.907" offset="30719582">And it's not surprising that under those circumstances that dispute immediately arose as to where -- as to what was meant by these two phrases.</text>
            <text syncTime="7689.695" offset="30758766">Even the ordinary low water mark gave rise to a dispute and was even more dispute about what is the outer limit of inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="7700.132" offset="30800457">At that point, the case was referred to William H. Davis, a Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="7707.949" offset="30831700">There were a series of motions in the Court and as the issues ultimately took form there was submitted to him seven representative segments and he was instructed to determine whether the waters of those segments were inland waters or not inland waters and to lay down general criterion, the general criteria by which he judged those specific illustration and which it was contemplated could then be used for the rest of the California coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="7743.595" offset="30974328">In addition, he was to set forth the criteria for the determining what was the ordinary low water mark on the shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="7752.145" offset="31008496">He made a report in 1952 that the late ‘51 or ‘52, in which he determined that virtually all the disputed areas were not inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="7766.115" offset="31064398">In other words, the Report was overwhelmingly in favor of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7771.511" offset="31086028">At this point, Congress enacted the Submerged Lands Act just very shortly later and gave to the States, I'm speaking generally and not attempting to beg any of the questions, gave to the State at least the three-mile strip beyond the coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="7793.884" offset="31175471">And as a practical matter and this is the answer -- part of the answer to the Court's question why the delay, as a practical matter at that stage that gave all the oil and the royalties to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="7807.834" offset="31231269">This is very deep water off the coast there and the methods of drilling at that time was taking course of getting oil did not permit or at least did not make it economically feasible to drill farther down and so that nobody was really interested in determining as I understand it I wasn't here, what was the limit of inland waters or what was the limit, if I may put it that way, of the three-mile strip?</text>
            <text syncTime="7836.311" offset="31345162">There were other reasons, I think, that explains the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="7841.010" offset="31363971">I'm told one of them was the case was here and exceptions before the Court and the number of lawyers handling it assumes that the next move was the courts and now that hardly explain to full 10 years but I think it enters into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7854.334" offset="31417260">There were conversations between California and the federal officials which are related in some detail in papers attached to our supplemental complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="7864.661" offset="31458638">We put some what different interpretations on them but at least they show that there was a talk and I suspect that that talk catch up on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7874.523" offset="31498031">Perhaps, these are also matters that are intensely complicated and just the time went by in doing anything about it when there was no urgency.</text>
            <text syncTime="7884.006" offset="31535961">Now, I might at this point answer one other question that I think Justice Harlan raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="7888.552" offset="31554142">There has to the best of my knowledge and I am quite sure I would know Justice Harlan there has been no problem with the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="7896.668" offset="31586638">Alright, there had very recently been some problems of a rather different character but some prevalence come up which Florida and the United States are currently discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7907.419" offset="31629584">They have arisen very recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="7910.969" offset="31643794">So far as Louisiana goes, there is a very real problem and there is an enormous amount of some amount of money tied up in escrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="7920.030" offset="31680052">We have been discussing this actively at least for the last 4 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="7925.526" offset="31702100">What the next step will be I'm not able to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="7929.269" offset="31717042">So far as Alaska is concerned, the problem has forgotten to take shape as a result of disability to drill in deeper water and you have heard reference to one case which insisted should be brought in the District Court rather than here just to see if we couldn't get some of the things settled before troubling this party.</text>

            <text syncTime="7979.964" offset="31919856">But that's -- I don't think that's a serious problem it is something that we want to open up and there are several oil companies that are definitely interested in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="8133.925" offset="32535615">Since that was our theory, we filed a supplemental complaint thinking that the Special Master's Report was still relevant that the evidence was the issue on the point and that the case was ready to go forward, and while I assume this Court didn't make a final determination on any of those legal issues at least thought it was enough to it to prevent us to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="8160.093" offset="32640313">And then no exceptions were filed to the Special Master -- Master's Report and that brought us here.</text>

            <text syncTime="8186.507" offset="32745953">And we have set forth on these colored maps that I have asked the clerk to distribute, a map which indicates in very general terms what is involved actually here and what it means by way of principle as we see it with respect to other the parts of the coast.</text>

            <text syncTime="8908.467" offset="35633842">Section 2 (a) (2) provides that the lands beneath navigable waters means, all lands permanently or periodically covered by tidal waters up to but not above the land of mean high tide and seaward to a line three geographical miles distant from the coastline of each such state and to the boundary line of each such state where in any case such boundary as it existed at the time such state became a member of the Union are heretofore approved by Congress extends seaward or into the Gulf of Mexico beyond three geographical miles.</text>

            <text syncTime="9103.358" offset="36413336">Indeed, the fear was expressed before Congress and maybe that somebody would read this as permitting you to go to historic boundaries without limit and there were a number components of the Act to express that fear and as a result there that was put on by amendment rather late in the debate on the Act, the closing part of Section 2 (b) down at the bottom of 2 (a) of my appendix which says, “But in no event shall the term ‘boundaries' or the term ‘lands beneath navigable waters' be interpreted as extending from the coastline more than three geographical miles into the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean or more than three marine leagues into the Gulf of Mexico.”</text>
            <text syncTime="9158.444" offset="36633704">Now the plain meaning of that is that the historic boundaries are cut off at three miles and I think that that is the general tenure or three leagues in the gulf but in any even that it is a limitation upon any historic claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="9418.911" offset="37675572">My argument now proceeds in the four main steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="9426.215" offset="37704829">First, directing ourselves to the meaning of inland waters in the Submerged Lands Act, the outer limit of inland waters which we say must be the point of reference to any claim based on the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="9439.394" offset="37757492">We say first that the Congress made the grant in terms of a line drawn three miles from the coastline and the seaward limit of inland waters because those concepts were familiar to Congress at the time it enacted the statute as a result of the entire litigation over the title short while and because they were the terms used in this Court's decree in the United States against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="9468.963" offset="37875775">In other words, we say that there was an intention to refer to the very concept that had been used in the argument of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="9477.498" offset="37909943">Now I'm just outlining these points for the moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="9523.110" offset="38092382">Now, our second part having shown first that the intent was to refer back to the usage previously in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="9532.548" offset="38130103">Our second point is to show that inland waters as used in this Court's decision and in the decree was used to describe those areas which were inland waters for the purposes of external sovereignty of the United States in the sense that the United States would or could exclude all nationals of foreign nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="9559.068" offset="38236264">Now, I point out that if those two propositions are established then it becomes immaterial whether this are some California title is the Pollard and Hagan theory or is the Submerged Lands Act because the two come together and the Congress used the term inland waters in the same sense that, we say, that it was used in the original case of the United States versus California and we go on to discover what that single term meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="9593.066" offset="38372206">Our third point directing ourselves to that term, what will be that the State Department's representations as to the rules to limiting what the United States will regard as inland waters for the purposes of external sovereignty are conclusive but we also say that the representations made in this case by the State Department printed in the back of our brief do in fact conform to what have historically been the rules applied by the United States in determining what are inland waters for the purposes of the external sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="9634.679" offset="38538658">And then my fourth point proceeding on from those will be that as the Special Master for the most part found, the disputed areas are not inland waters under the rules applied by the United States in the conduct of its external relations and that of course will bring me to the specific rules that applicable to the detail of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="9664.278" offset="38657045">It was -- I will show in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="9666.228" offset="38664882">I think I can show, I certainly argue that it was used deliberately to take up the meaning that it had been used in -- previously in the litigation between the United States and California and in the other decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9683.568" offset="38734263">Now, I'm going to try to develop those four points in the ordering by Judge Stevens and our first point as I say is that inland waters is used in Section 2 (c) of the Submerged Land Act in defining one segment of coastline in the same sense that it was used in this Court's prior decision and in the decree in United States against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="9713.346" offset="38853381">First I'd like to say just a word about whether this case involves a question of domestic or international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="9723.543" offset="38894132">In one sense, it most clearly is a problem of domestic law as this Court held in United States against Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="9731.983" offset="38927882">I take it if Congress wants to, it can divide up as Mr. Keatinge said the continental shelf as between the United States and the States in anyway wants to.</text>
            <text syncTime="9742.348" offset="38969365">I can't agree that it has hardly a ripple on our international relations because we have that decision cited against us by Mexico quite often but it certainly is within the power of Congress and I'm not attempting to reargue any part of that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="9758.603" offset="39034358">But it is also possible for Congress in settling a domestic question to refer, the reader as it were, to concepts from other areas of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="9772.733" offset="39090887">I find it helpful here to think of the problem we often have in determining what is the federal rule applicable say to a question of interest on a note owing the United States that the federal rule is the law of whatever State you'll have to be in for many purposes and so here Congress in enacting this Submerged Lands Act could refer the Muslim law or Roman Civil Law or as we think it could do to a concept that had meaning in international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="9803.699" offset="39214707">And if it did refer to that concept, which of course I had to demonstrate, then the case must be decided in terms of the rules that apply in administering that concept and they would be the rules of international law being used for a domestic purpose and as if they were domestic law.</text>
            <text syncTime="9827.088" offset="39308330">Now, we say there are four reasons for concluding that the term inland waters is used in Section 2 (c) of the Submerged Lands Act to describe those waters over which a nation asserts in its international relations the same exclusive sovereignty that it would assert over land areas in contrast with territorial waters where its sovereignty is subject to some limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="9861.026" offset="39444062">In the first place, this was, we think, the only normal natural use of the term inland waters in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="9872.098" offset="39488366">The place where called concept was important, except for a few insurance policies was in external relations and it had almost no importance in terms of internal relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="9887.897" offset="39551582">Furthermore, by 1953, the rules for determining what were inland waters as a matter of external relation what were fairly well known although not crystallized upon all points.</text>
            <text syncTime="9901.397" offset="39605499">Our second reason is, California doesn't offer any determinable alternative meaning for inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="9910.228" offset="39640816">I have not seen in the briefs or heard here anything that I would call a definition of inland waters but she does say that inland waters are those areas which the States always thought were inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="9923.151" offset="39692539">Now, with due regard to the concept of the State's historic boundaries but the States never thought in terms of inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="9930.499" offset="39721900">Remember the state's historic boundaries extend beyond inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="9935.236" offset="39740918">They extend three miles out to the limits of the territorial sea, alright, and the States really had no occasion ever to think in terms of inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="9946.947" offset="39787729">Unless you got to accept as you might get a question, I overstated a little too much, except as you might get a question of why there's something say outside of one of these claimed bays was in three miles of the closing line.</text>
            <text syncTime="9962.714" offset="39850841">Then she would have to think about whether the bay was inland waters but apart from that State hardly ever thought in terms of inland waters.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="9985.816" offset="39943210">She did have to claim and the parts did in the two cases did reason in terms of whether it was -- the bay that was inland waters?</text>
            <text syncTime="9994.649" offset="39978527">Yes, but the things -- the other things the State does normally aren't in those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="10004.611" offset="40018442">Our third point and much the most important reason for giving the term the inland waters, the same international meaning which it has in the prior decree in this case is that that is the sense in which the term was consistently used in all discussions of the ownership of submerged lands about outside and inside Congress up through the enactment of the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="10036.907" offset="40147592">In the original case in the complaint, we said that we were talking about the area outside inland waters and we referred to them in terms that made quite clear that we were referring to international concepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="10051.299" offset="40205166">The brief even explained that we were defining inland, using inland waters as a term that was important in our international relations and if you remember the opinion the Court frequently uses the term inland waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="10069.713" offset="40278831">In the course of an opinion which was reasoning about the importance of the three-mile strip in terms of our external relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="10080.282" offset="40321045">Well, now if the critical thing with our external relations over the three-mile strip obviously where the three-mile strip is, is equally impart in terms of our external relations because you do things to people at places without doing abstraction and the final decree then goes ahead and uses the term inland waters but without any further elaboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="10104.929" offset="40419683">Now, the case went back to the Special Master, the United States, California and the Special Master all agreed that the term without any argument, that the term inland waters was used in the sense that it had in our external relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="10123.916" offset="40495647">The Master said on page 6 of the Report, “The parties agree and recognizing that the determination of the demarcation line which inland waters end in the marginal sea begins also determines the exterior limit of the marginal belt.”</text>
            <text syncTime="10138.378" offset="40553430">And therefore involves a question of the territorial jurisdiction of the United States as against foreign nations i.e., a question of external sovereignty and then he goes on to talking about finding answers appropriate answers to these questions of external sovereignty so that at least in the discussion in the case, that equally in the other cases, the Louisiana and Texas cases comparable to the original United States against California, inland waters was used by everything to mean the concept that was important in our international or external relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="10180.050" offset="40720196">It seems to me, it's just a matter of common sense if we had no other evidence, it would be absurd to suppose that at this point the Congress suddenly used inland waters in a new and wholly different and undefined and indeed unexplained sense because nobody explained what he meant by inland waters or anything different that had been meant in the discussion up to this point and as a matter of fact the Report of the Special Master was before Congress, it was known by Congress I think it was even credited from the record of the some of the hearings so they were entirely familiar about how California as well as the United States Master had used the term inland water.</text>
            <text syncTime="10230.254" offset="40920921">Now, it's not necessary here for us to rely on speculation or common sense as I called it a moment ago on this point, the legislative history shows affirmatively that Congress used the words coastline and the segment of it inland waters for the very purpose of drawing upon the concepts embodied in the Court's previous rulings and I rely on two sorts of things for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="10258.299" offset="41033143">At first there are many specific instances of that usage collected on page 18 of California closing brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="10268.108" offset="41072431">There, she refers the Court to a number of amendments which would have had the effect of restoring to the gulf states so much of their area as went out three miles from the coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="10284.694" offset="41138678">These were amendments offered by Senator Anderson, Senator Lehman and the group of Senators who were fighting the Holland bill and the more extensive grants to the element they went through and of course they were trying to cut back the Gulf States which were claiming out three leagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="10301.923" offset="41207641">Their amendment spoke of three miles from the coastline and they explained that one of the reasons for those amendments was that this would put the outer limit of where the States could go at the outer limit of the United States for international purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="10321.820" offset="41287262">Now, of course those amendments were defeated and the defeat makes it quite clear as this court held in United States against Louisiana that the outer limit of our international boundary is not the outer limit of what Congress might give or might have given or in that case did give the State but the defeat, I submit, was not attributable to the fact that these amendments used inland waters are coastline, coastline in an international sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="10356.812" offset="41427174">The reason they were defeated was because they took away six miles of what the State hope to get and that was certainly reason enough for defeating those amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="10367.262" offset="41468970">I think it's most implausible just it follows that they were defeated simply because they used coastline plainly in the sense that is used in international relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="10380.934" offset="41523722">Now, the intent of Congress is revealed even more clearly in the discussions concerning proposals to define inland waters with greater particularity.</text>
            <text syncTime="10393.698" offset="41574713">One proposal of which was offered by a witness before the Senate Committee and which is referred to in California's brief was to define coastline as the line asserted by the United States as marking the seaward limit of its inland waters in respect to estuaries, parks, harbors, bays, channels, straits, historic bays, sounds or other bodies of water along the coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="10422.603" offset="41690384">There was a lot of objection to that proposal, some of it from the State Department and eventually the proposal was not adopted by the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="10433.885" offset="41735523">California tells us that this was a done as Senator Cordon explained because we might be putting the United States on record with the precedent which we intended to apply domestically but which might be applied internationally but as you take the trouble to check, you will find quotation which California puts an immediate juxtaposition with the proposed amendment that I just read came 20 days and a thousand pages later in the course of the hearings and that the point to which Senator Cordon was talking was something quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="10470.876" offset="41883481">He was talking to a proposal of Senator Long.</text>
            <text syncTime="10476.159" offset="41904588">What had happened was this, the bill had originally included after the words inland waters or coastline in conjunction with them a string of words straits, parks, harbors and so on and so forth and that had been deleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="10494.983" offset="41979925">Senator Long wanted to put most of it back in.</text>
            <text syncTime="10499.358" offset="41997375">Senator Cordon was explaining why it had been deleted by the Committee and why he was opposing Senator Long's desire to get it back in.</text>
            <text syncTime="10510.885" offset="42043455">His desire of course is to increase his claim to bays and help Louisiana push inland waters out and it was at that point that Senator Cordon said, gave this explanation and he also said it was not the Chairman's view that we were attempting to draw a line to limiting inland waters but that we were using a term that is well-known in the law and is defined by the Court in the California case, I assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="10541.232" offset="42164872">So quite clear that he wanted to take the same simple term that the Court had used and put the matter down where the courts have been when you left it so far inland waters was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="10555.588" offset="42222341">This becomes even clearer if you read the Committee Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="10559.725" offset="42238851">The question of what the Committee Report from the senate said the question of what constitutes inland waters where it should be left where Congress finds it which is the only point that I'm seeking to make the moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="10576.749" offset="42306978">The floor discussions then even make that clearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="10582.253" offset="42328921">There was a reference on the floor to California's claims to the area South of Point Conception which is this whole so-called “overall unit area” including some of the bays and I suspect that it was a reference to the whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="10598.002" offset="42391928">Although, it wasn't explicitly so if they knew of claims South of Point Conception they must have known the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="10604.280" offset="42417110">As Senator Douglas then rose and passed “Whether the coastline may be interpreted as being the outer shores of islands far off the shores of the mainland as California has been claiming under a state statute and I believe before the Master and chancery of the Supreme Court in which event boundaries and ownership could go out a long distance from the continental land mass.”</text>
            <text syncTime="10627.538" offset="42510106">Senator Holland then replied, “My understanding is that California has no provable case beyond three miles from its mainland and that as to the islands its provable case would be three miles around each of the islands.”</text>
            <text syncTime="10644.872" offset="42579487">The joint resolution simply continues the outer boundary of inland waters pursuant to decisions of the Supreme Court already made.</text>
