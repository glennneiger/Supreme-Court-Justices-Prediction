            <text syncTime="36.721" offset="146808">The issue in this case is whether the State of Idaho may constitutionally tax the transaction in which gasoline is sold to the Atomic Energy Commission in another state, Utah, for use by the Commission in the taxing state, Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.303" offset="221205">We say that it cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.960" offset="231758">In a nutshell, our position is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.890" offset="243461">If the legal incidence of this tax is upon the seller, as both parties agree that it is, then the tax violates both the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, because every act which the seller performed in connection with this transaction was performed outside the State of Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.675" offset="326635">And the transaction itself was in no way related to any of the seller's activities within Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.480" offset="357878">On the other hand, if this were regarded as a use tax with the legal incidence falling upon the purchaser, then in that case, the tax would be invalid for a different reason, namely because in this case, the purchaser was the United States Government which enjoys a constitutional immunity from such taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.802" offset="1735158">The bids were submitted in Salt Lake City and they were accepted by the government in Seattle.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.842" offset="1763265">As I've indicated, the bids were submitted in alternative form and the bid which the government accepted was the bid f.o.b., the seller's both plans in Salt Lake City.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.010" offset="1807987">The contract was performed according to its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.308" offset="1821153">The goods were delivered by -- the gas was delivered by the seller at its both plans in Salt Lake City to carriers selected by the government and paid by the government or by the government's contracting agent, Phillips Petroleum Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.330" offset="1893251">Both courts below held the title pass to the purchaser in Utah and it's quite clear I think that the purchaser bore the risk of loss and transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.254" offset="1932957">In short, I don't think it will be disputed that Utah Oil Company had fully performed its contract with respect to each shipment while the goods were still in Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.864" offset="1979455">When the gas arrived in Idaho, it was placed in storage tanks owned by the government and eventually it was consumed in government owned vehicles for the purpose of transporting government employees to and from the National Reactor Testing Station.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.232" offset="2044865">This transportation operation was actually handled by Phillips Petroleum Company pursuant to its management contract with the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.004" offset="2076003">But the fares collected from the passengers were paid over to the government and the losses regularly incurred in the operation where was absorbed by the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.036" offset="2152072">Now the Idaho tax is not easily to classify in any of the traditional categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.742" offset="2170880">The statute imposes an excise tax, which was called by the statute an excise tax of $0.6 per gallon on all gasoline which is received by Idaho licensed dealers, that is by dealers who hold the permit to distribute gasoline within Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.353" offset="2237336">The tax is payable as I say on all gasoline which those dealers received.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.508" offset="2253949">But the term received is given a rather peculiar definition by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.970" offset="2271817">The statute provides among other things that whenever gasoline is sold or supplied by any licensed dealer for importation into the State of Idaho from the point of origin outside the state, then it is considered to be received by the licensed dealer immediately after it is unloaded by the purchaser in Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.128" offset="2364500">Now pursuant to that provision, the Idaho tax collector demanded that Utah Oil pay the tax and it paid the tax under protest, and filed a suit for refund in the Idaho courts.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank I. Goodman</label>
            <text syncTime="625.538" offset="2502113">The Idaho trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Utah Oil holding that the tax was invalid under the Commerce and Due Process Clauses because of its extraterritorial character.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.081" offset="2544222">But the Idaho Supreme Court reversed holding that the fact that Utah Oil held a valid dealer's permit in Idaho gave the state the sufficient nexus to justify taxing this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.884" offset="2615484">The point I want to emphasize first is that this is not a use tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.127" offset="2632411">The parties agreed that it's a privilege tax, the incidence of which is upon this seller rather than the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.597" offset="2658325">And unlike the typical use tax statute, it neither requires nor authorizes the dealer to collect the tax from the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.082" offset="2692284">The Attorney General of Idaho has twice issued formal rulings holding that this tax is on the dealer and the trial -- Idaho trial court in this case so ruled specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.790" offset="2735125">The Supreme Court of Idaho did not speak directly to this point but I think as we point out in our brief that there are strong intimations in its opinion that it too regarded the tax as on the dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.449" offset="2785698">So in this oral argument, I'm going to assume that the tax is on the dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.263" offset="2808999">In our brief, we elaborate the reasons why the tax would also be invalid under the principle of McCulloch versus Maryland if it were viewed as a tax upon the purchaser for the use of the gasoline in Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.222" offset="2860826">In that regard, the claim is made that the real purchaser here was Phillips Petroleum Company and not the government and that the government was merely acting as a sort of purchasing agent for Phillips when it brought the gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.300" offset="2913176">We deal with that contention at some length in our reply brief which I see is now have been distributed to the members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.487" offset="2945881">Here, I would only say this that the parties are in agreement or at least it's not disputed that the purchase price of this gasoline was paid by the government not by Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.525" offset="2990080">And that alone, I should think, would be decisive of who the purchaser was.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.308" offset="3005231">Beyond that, as I said, it was consumed in government owned vehicles, stored in government owned tanks, and used in a operation which regularly incurred a loss which the government absorbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.606" offset="3050371">So to say that the government in buying this gas was acting as Phillips' as agent is simply to turn the relationship of the parties upside down.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.657" offset="3082553">The Idaho Supreme Court recognized that, stated that it was -- wasn't necessary to consider the role of Phillips in this transaction because Phillips was merely acting as the government's agent in everything that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.206" offset="3132813">The basic principle which we think governs this case is that a state may not tax transactions or activities which occur outside of its borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.785" offset="3171056">In this case, every activity in which the seller participated, took place outside the borders of Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.822" offset="3207210">The government solicited bids originally in Salt Lake -- in Seattle, Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.305" offset="3225182">The bids were submitted in Salt Lake City, Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.451" offset="3237721">Bids were accepted in Seattle, Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.890" offset="3247543">The gasoline was delivered to carriers selected and paid by the government in Utah and title passed in Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.580" offset="3278263">In other words, every act performed by this seller in the course of soliciting, negotiating, executing, and performing the contract was extraterritorial as far as Idaho was concerned and was in no way dependent upon any privilege conferred by the State of Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.701" offset="3358720">Now, the argument is made by the state that they're entitled to tax this transaction because Idaho did other business or rather because Utah Oil did other business in the State of Idaho, and was licensed to do business there.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.912" offset="3415562">And we think that contention is refuted by the decisions of this Court which have established the principle that when a state taxes a corporation for the privilege of doing business within its borders, it may not include within the measure of that tax any interstate transaction or out of state transaction which does not involve any activities within the state and which is no way related or dependent upon any activities within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.781" offset="3539069">That principle was laid down in Norton versus Illinois and we think was reaffirmed by this Court last term in General Motors versus Washington.</text>
