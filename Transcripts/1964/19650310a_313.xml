            <text syncTime="80.963" offset="323814">In that sense that was an objection to his testimony all the way through.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.480" offset="369894">However, it is a contention of the State of Alabama that that objection was a personal warrant and was not an objection by Douglas by the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.692" offset="462681">And I was talking about the objections made by Mr. Esco, the defense attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.378" offset="525479">Now, Mr. Esco objected for the last time on page 121 of the record and he -- the first statement on that page by Mr. Esco was that he objected to the reading of the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.743" offset="654942">Now, we submit that at that time, those statements had been read and jury had said that he was a hostile witness during those cross-examinations and --</text>

            <text syncTime="192.332" offset="769254">The question was, I will ask you if on January 20, 1962 and then Mr. Esco said, â€œIf Your Honor please, I object to the reading of any document or purported confession and Mr. McCleod for the State said, "this is cross-examination."</text>
            <text syncTime="211.238" offset="844904">And the Court said, "Hostile witness".</text>
            <text syncTime="213.924" offset="855667">And Mr. Esco said, "We accept, if you please."</text>
            <text syncTime="217.458" offset="869773">Then they asked another question and Mr. Esco said, "I object to this being read in the presence of the jury."</text>
            <text syncTime="224.018" offset="896000">And Mr. McCleod for the State said, "You've already gotten objection in there."</text>

            <text syncTime="263.995" offset="1055974">The only thing that had been done at that time by the Solicitor was the beginning of the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.010" offset="1315944">It was not subject to cross-examination and we move to exclude it from the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.632" offset="1334439">And the Court says, "The Court will deny your notion -- I mean your motion."</text>

            <text syncTime="355.785" offset="1423047">Now if that doesn't make any clear to the Court that he has objected too and I don't know what would be.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.354" offset="1445407">Mr. Justice Stewart, I do not want to evade your question at all but I wonder if I may answer it in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.588" offset="1506325">We have in this case that only the question of whether Douglas' rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.326" offset="1585215">We could have -- the Court could have -- the Solicitor could have violated every right that Loyd had under any section of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.442" offset="1665672">But if in doing that, he did not violate a constitutional right of Douglas, then this case, we submit should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.827" offset="1731291">Now as I said, the primary argument of the State is that this could rest on an adequate state ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.454" offset="1805793">It seems to me and we submit that the only prejudicial, allegedly prejudicial thing that was done insofar as Douglas was concerned, was that he was -- was as Loyd was asked by the Solicitor leaving question -- questions which if had been answered would have ejected hearsay evidence into this case and no doubt that Loyd would answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.451" offset="2053747">Therefore, there is no evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.440" offset="2089691">We have questions and the refusal to answer in this case, and not -- not evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="565.182" offset="2260637">We don't know or I don't know but I have heard that if Loyd repudiate his confession at his trial the day before, he could at their will repudiate it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.016" offset="2360007">He could have said, yes I've made that statement but it was a lie.</text>

            <text syncTime="1483.723" offset="5934811">And by analogy to the Kissick case that this can be done under the law of the State of Alabama and should have been done in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1593.219" offset="6372833">I will say that I believe that throughout this proceeding, Mr. Douglas -- Mr. Esco made as main objections as he felt he could possibly make without affirming the dignity of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.783" offset="6415047">It's replete with objections in each one bringing in the same thing in a different forum but the Solicitor started this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.829" offset="6451304">"I will ask you if on the night of January 20, 1962, in Selma, Alabama in the Dallas County jail, if you didn't make the following statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.615" offset="6598426">Now, the contention of the State, that -- thereafter, when the prosecutor was reading these questions that because he didn't get answers, the matter wasn't in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.151" offset="6644506">We contend that it is obvious from reading this that this was a device that the form of the question was a device to impart the contents of this confession to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.424" offset="6689646">And in this confession, Loyd clearly implicates the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.636" offset="6706469">He says in effect, "I was alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.821" offset="6715246">I was driving but Mr. Douglas did the actual shooting."</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.476" offset="6729874">So that that this device of reading this confession that took some seven pages in the transcript was ten pages long in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.735" offset="6766864">The Solicitor read the entire thing through in front of the jury and we submit that that was merely a device to get this information, the contents of this before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.264" offset="6820989">According to the Kissick case that the prosecutor could have just handed it to Mr. Esco and asked him to read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.093" offset="6844291">If only wanted to do was to refresh his memory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.390" offset="6857456">Of course in this particular case, Mr. Loyd was semi-illiterate and probably couldn't have read it intelligently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.365" offset="6889430">So, the Kissick case gave an alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.694" offset="6902700">They said you can excuse the jury and then read aloud to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.242" offset="6916911">So, either of these alternatives were available to the Solicitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.223" offset="6932793">Had all he wanted to do was to refresh this man's recollection?</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.731" offset="6950870">But it is clear from what he actually did do, that his intention and his purpose, was to provide a method or device so that the contents of this confession would get before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.868" offset="6999458">He didn't offer it in evidence, but the fact that he didn't offer it in evidence doesn't alleviate the action that he has done in making the contents available so that the jury heard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.311" offset="7049195">And we submit that it -- it's not actually the form of the question that is important but actually the content of this question.</text>
