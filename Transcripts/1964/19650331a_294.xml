            <text syncTime="41.109" offset="164362">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.838" offset="179304">This case is here on a petition for forfeiture of an automobile which was seized as it crossed the Stateline from New Jersey to Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.047" offset="232176">The car was stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.721" offset="242834">The driver was arrested and the car was seized as was 375 bottles of liquor contained in the trunk and the rear seat of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.372" offset="297482">These bottles of liquor were legitimate brand name bottles of liquor which did not contain Pennsylvania state license tax stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.196" offset="352758">The lower court denied the petition for forfeiture, concluding that there had been an unreasonable search and seizure, that there had been no probable cause for stopping the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.340" offset="409287">The Superior Court of Pennsylvania reversed, concluding that the State does and should have the right to stop travelers to find out if they are transporting any items upon which a tax would be due.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.516" offset="469995">And they concluded without actually making a factual finding that the search and seizure had been reasonable under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.826" offset="503223">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania completely invade -- or avoided this question by concluding that the exclusionary rule is not applicable in a forfeiture proceeding which it concluded was not a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.353" offset="585352">Less than four years ago, this Court in Mapp versus Ohio concluded that it was going to close the only courtroom door, remaining open to evidence secured by official lawlessness in flagrant abuse of the basic right of privacy reserved to all persons as a specific guarantee against that very same lawless conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.767" offset="678975">The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania apparently finding the courtroom doors closed is apparently trying to get into the courtroom windows.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.774" offset="718994">Here, they are arguing that the exclusionary rule does not apply in a forfeiture proceeding, it applies only in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.657" offset="786599">I believe that the Mapp citation -- quotation from Mapp does not so restrict the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.793" offset="819096">The first question here to be decided I believe, is whether there was probable cause or stopping the car, arresting the driver and seizing the liquor and the automobile without a warrant.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="219.688" offset="878655">Well that's a question that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did not get to because they cite a standard wrong, because that court held that even if there was a probable cause, still a disciplinary rule did not apply to a forfeiture proceeding, is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="250.624" offset="1002475">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania concluded that there are no property rights in contraband and that therefore, they never got to the question whether there was an unlawful search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.255" offset="1040927">It's respectfully submitted however that this car is not itself contraband unless and until it has been proved in a court of law that its use was illegal.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.138" offset="1140506">It is respectfully submitted that we are not questioning here, items which are per se contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.269" offset="1173002">We are questioning here the seizure and forfeiture of an automobile which is not itself contraband, but which is contraband only because evidence is submitted in a court of law showing that it was used illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.653" offset="1238518">In other words, it is not per se contraband like narcotics, counterfeit plates and other items which the -- mere possession would be a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.923" offset="1447602">And I'm trying to (Voice Overlap) avoid the question for this reason Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.990" offset="1459931">I don't think that the liquor is here before us today and I would be sorely pressed to determine whether a bottle which does not contain a tax stamp is itself contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.093" offset="1500369">I don't think we have to arrive at that decision -- that question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.690" offset="1518759">If this were moonshine liquor, there might be a different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.850" offset="1535373">The mere fact that the bottle does not contain a tax stamp, under the statute it appears to be sufficient to render it contraband by itself and I would say that it appears to be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.523" offset="1574034">Whether that statute as so applied would be constitutional, is not before this Court really, because in this case, the liquor was forfeit without an answer being filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.857" offset="1611337">In this case though, we submit that this is one step farther removed even if the liquor itself were contraband and could be forfeit on the spot without a judicial determination, we submit here that the car itself does not fall on this category by any stretch of reasoning because the only way the car can become contraband is when its use has been proved in the court of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.303" offset="1721156">And here, the entire evidence relating to the use of the automobile is expressly excluded from proof in the court of law by the Mapp case if we are correct that there was an unreasonable search and seizure of this car and its contents.</text>

            <text syncTime="457.772" offset="1831079">The only way in which this issue came up in Jeffers and Trupiano was that in the pish -- petition to suppress the evidence, apparently, the counsel asked for the return of the items.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.615" offset="1882384">The Court concluded in both cases that since they were contraband, they could not be returned, but Jeffers and Trupiano involved one instance narcotics, which by themselves fall into a different category, are clearly contraband because as in the -- in other case, I believe it was (Inaudible), the Court had said that these narcotics and I think in that case, heroin, are never valid, never -- the possession of narcotics is never valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.750" offset="2014981">And in the other case, it was white -- white whiskey that, it was moonshine liquor and distilled, distill equipment which of course could never be used for a valid purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.708" offset="2058762">In this case, however, we have an automobile which of course is used for a valid purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="574.779" offset="2299089">They could destroy the liquor if -- at least, that's what the facts in this case far, that they did seize and it was not contested and they could destroy the liquor but they cannot introduce it into a courtroom to prove that the car was being improperly used.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.094" offset="2364291">If however, as Justice White has suggested, the officers had observed a violation of law and had observed the automobile being used illegally for transportation of illegal liquor, this would be a different question because there, we would have evidence, proper evidence in a courtroom showing the illegal use and then the car would be forfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.983" offset="2463869">I don't really think that there is too much argument left in this Court that the search and seizure here were valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.337" offset="2505247">I think the Beck case has pretty clearly lay that question to rest as does the Henry case.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.422" offset="2533669">The factual background behind the seizure here is very short.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.928" offset="2559687">It appears on approximately three or four pages of this transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.478" offset="2577868">A -- an enforcement officer of the Liquor Control Board testified that he observed this automobile crossing the bridge from Camden into Philadelphia, that it was riding low in the rear.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.371" offset="2637427">He admitted that there was no other violation of law observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.053" offset="2652160">He admitted that he observed nothing wrong with the car other than it was riding low in the rear.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.393" offset="2677551">They stopped the car, they placed the individual under arrest and searched the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.269" offset="2701061">The lower court, the fact-finding court here, did find as a matter of fact that there was no reasonable search and seizure and that the -- there was no probable cause for stopping the car whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.549" offset="2770129">As this Court has said in the Carroll case and the Beck case, the factual findings of the trial court must be given great difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.227" offset="2804820">Furthermore, there were no appellate findings to the contrary here.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.154" offset="2820598">The only finding in either of the appellate courts, the Superior or the Supreme Court that there was reasonable cause for a stopping of the -- and0 a search of the car was the broad statement by the Superior Court that under the circumstances, they opinioned that search and seizure were reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.343" offset="2897293">They apparently suggested that because this was December the 16th, near a holiday season, they could take judicial notice of the fact that automobiles would be transporting illegal liquor from New Jersey into Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.374" offset="2961450">I think that the dissenting opinions in that court lay that question to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.524" offset="2990080">The Superior Court majority also points out that the -- there was a very skimpy record here made in the trial court and couldn't tell whether the officers could observe the back of the car or whether they are -- had observed a misdemeanor thing committed in their presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.355" offset="3069388">And I believe again, that a search of the record, an independent search of the record by this Court taking only the uncontested facts will show clearly that the trial court was correct in its conclusion that there was absolutely no evidence of any illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.245" offset="3136888">The government did not sustain its burden of proving that the car had been used illegally or that there was any probable cause for stopping the car at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.286" offset="3185058">In the Beck case of course, the facts were even stronger.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.318" offset="3197179">There, they had a police picture of the driver of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.402" offset="3213584">They knew that he had a record and they had some information about his activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.071" offset="3240229">In this case, we have none of that whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.826" offset="3251304">We have no prior observation of this car, although one of the officers testified that he had observed some other late model black Plymouth car traveling.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.880" offset="3307520">It was not this car.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.072" offset="3312222">He admitted that he had never seen this car before.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.470" offset="3321835">He admitted that they did not know the driver of the car, the plaintiffs in this case, and he admitted that he had no reason to stop the car except mere suspicion, and the lower court so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.297" offset="3385156">In fact Your Honor, if we are correct that this an unreasonable search and seizure and if the Mapp decision is taken to exclude from a courtroom, any evidence direct or circumstantial arising from that search and seizure, then we would be forced to strike from the record here, almost all of pages 4, 5 and 6 in which the officer testified to what he observed and then the only thing left in the record would be the bald statement that a car was traveling from New Jersey to Philadelphia and that it was stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.144" offset="3548473">If you strike from the record all observations of the liquor which was seized after the stopping of the car and the arrest of the driver, then that is all that is left and this leaves us a picture of the State of Pennsylvania forfeiting a car on testimony that is traveled from New Jersey to Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.497" offset="3641887">Now the rationale of the Mapp case, the reason for the decision in the Mapp case according to this Court appears to be that it is to deter official governmental lawlessness, to remove the incentive for governmental violations of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.007" offset="3740003">To allow the government to benefit from its lawlessness here in stopping this car by seizing that car and taking the car for its own benefit is to leave the same incentive which this Court in Mapp tried to remove.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.276" offset="3825058">True, they're not using the car in evidence against the driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.876" offset="3843448">They are not using the liquor in evidence against the driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.991" offset="3859958">But they are using the liquor illegally seized against the driver's property, his automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.250" offset="3892976">If it is not usable against him, under the Fourteenth Amendment, it should equally be unusable against him to forfeit his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.831" offset="3935295">Whether we call this a quasi criminal case or whether we analogize a forfeiture proceeding to a penalty, a criminal proceeding, we still come to the same conclusion that to allow the illegally seized evidence to be used in this proceeding in court, would be to take a man's property without the due process -- without the factors which this Court said, fall within the concept of ordered liberty, by permitting the exclusionary rule not to apply here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1135.586" offset="4542276">Sir, I believe that there are two answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.378" offset="4561502">The first answer is that I believe that the Twenty-first Amendment did not repeal the other portions of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.586" offset="4598282">In the Hostetter case before this Court just this last term, the -- this Court said that to conclude that the Twenty-first Amendment repealed the Commerce Clause is in absurd over simplification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.831" offset="4655229">In this case, to conclude that it also repeals the Equal Protection and Fifth Amend -- Fifth and Fourth Amendments, would I think to be even more absurd of a simplification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.990" offset="4711863">I think Your Honor that the Fourth and Fifth Amendments would still apply to protect the driver against the self-incrimination, the -- from the items that were seized and his property from being forfeited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.379" offset="4769437">Now, that is not to say and this is the second answer Justice Stewart, that if they -- if the states do or should have the right to stop cars entering or travelers entering its borders to determine whether a tax has been paid on the items that were brought, the remedy is not necessarily the forfeiture of the items which they claim upon which no tax had been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.307" offset="4865149">The remedy may very well be a civil proceeding to obtain the tax against the individual -- from the individual who was bringing it in or possesses it or controls it but not necessarily a forfeiture of his property which they have found through official governmental lawlessness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1668.377" offset="6673450">The contention of the Commonwealth, however, is that the Twenty-first Amendment, gave to the Commonwealth the right to regulate or to prohibit the transportation of alcoholic beverages in a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.918" offset="6735621">In other words, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by this Amendment was given authority to regulate any transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.455" offset="6773760">Now this Court has declared in the case in 1938, Mitchell v. Helvering that Congress can pass a law, providing for the forfeiture of offending vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.080" offset="6844291">Here, we have an advice that is stated in our brief, this is not a revenue statute per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.563" offset="6874175">This is a statute to regulate alcoholic beverages in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.491" offset="6897894">And this Court in the (Inaudible) case certainly stated that there's no place if the state is given greater primary power to regulate the sale and use of anything as it is given in the sale and use of alcohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.168" offset="6980650">Now under that, and in the exercise of the rights given by the Twenty-first Amendment, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed not in the revenue laws but in the Liquor Code, two things which are before the Court of three two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.606" offset="7054420">Number one, it's illegal in Pennsylvania to either posses or transport liquor without the seal of the Commonwealth on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.670" offset="7090678">Number two, that if you do, you have no right -- no property right in the vehicle used to transport it, that vehicle is contraband and it maybe forfeited in a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.104" offset="7164343">We set that out, those statute are set forth in the Commonwealth's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.080" offset="7188271">Now, what we have here before us today and I'd like to get into the case at the end of my argument is actually the opinion of Judge Wyzanski in the Berkowitz case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.701" offset="7238740">I won't discuss that now, but I will discuss that opinion and how far that goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.045" offset="7272176">But I think that the argument of my worthy counsel while certainly appealing and it -- appealing to me and I know it's appealing to the Court by the reaction I observed, certainly ignores all the principles of forfeiture law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.865" offset="7339363">The first thing -- the purpose of the forfeiture law is not to secure additional revenue, nor is it as my worthy colleague contends to penalize a violator by taking his property away from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.879" offset="7399445">That -- neither one can be said to be the purpose of a forfeiture proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.225" offset="7424836">It's rather to secure a compliance with the law by taking away from a possessor, something which had been shown to be the mean, the method and the instrument of violating the law, that's what we're getting at, the main key instrument and a method of violating the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2116.662" offset="8466599">That man lost the title to that property as soon as he entered Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.876" offset="8495438">He cannot even come in here to complain that somebody has taken that property from me, doesn't have title to it no more than a person can complain if the representatives of Internal Revenue services go to a plant and get a bank safe in showing your deposits and withdrawals, that's not your property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.656" offset="8586553">This man lost any right, title of interest in this property, this automobile when it came into Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.694" offset="8634723">Now we're saying here also that the fact that is an automobile, doesn't change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.631" offset="8666488">The Court here will recall the Ryan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.074" offset="8680281">In Ryan case, you had the back bar, the bar with the stools and the other equipments which go with the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.181" offset="8728660">When you sell liquor, this was during prohibition, and this Court very wisely said, it's not the object, it's the use to which it is put and they permitted the condemnation of forfeiture of all of these equipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.152" offset="8800549">They said that is being used to violate the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.693" offset="8818730">Therefore, it doesn't come within the protection of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.548" offset="8842136">Now we're contending here that of course of an article of contraband comes into the position of the United States or the State of Pennsylvania, either one, the man has lost his right to title and interest in that and has no right to the return of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.724" offset="8902844">Now the automobile is contraband because it has been declared so by the Pennsylvania statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.341" offset="8925309">Now this Court also is -- had two cases, the Jeffers case referred to previously by the Court and the Trupiano case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2436.624" offset="9746495">A very -- right at the end of both of those cases, they come up with that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.809" offset="9771154">Now under 7302 of the Internal Revenue law, the courts have found that money can be contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.371" offset="9805427">It doesn't have to be liquor or narcotics as claimed here, money can be contraband if it's used in an illegal gambling operation, used to violate if it's a method means and the vehicle used to violate the law, it's not -- it's certainly contraband and can be forfeited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.605" offset="9874390">And in interpreting Section 7302, the courts have held this, and this is the thing that I think is important in our case, a forfeiture occurs simultaneously with the use of that vehicle to violate the law, whether it's an automobile or money or whatever it might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.501" offset="9957982">That car was forfeited before it was stopped.</text>

            <text syncTime="2500.925" offset="10003644">The courts have also held and this Court under Helvering v. Mitchell case in 1938 that these proceedings for forfeiture of a vehicle are civil and not criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.824" offset="10059233">There's never been a case and my worthy colleagues has been quoting criminal cases where the Fourth Amendment is applied but not one civil case where the Fourth Amendment, in the Helvering case by this Court has stated, that forfeiture cases are civil in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.356" offset="10133420">Now there are two very good circuit cases, the Ford Tudor case and the Saunders case in 1958, which definitely hold that any legal infirmity in the seizure will not affect the forfeiture proceeding because the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment the just do not apply to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.030" offset="10228088">Because the right to the property has passed, you don't have to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.069" offset="10244180">There's no search necessary in the forfeiture proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.231" offset="10260898">A property right the man has no title or interest in that property and you're only going out in getting your own property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.933" offset="10287647">That property belongs to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania either when a man loaded the liquor in it in Margate, New Jersey or at least when he touched the soil of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.814" offset="10327249">So there's no search necessary and the Fourth Amendment only guarantees against unreasonable search -- and you don't need a search, you just go out and take what belongs to you, you seized it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2855.324" offset="11421257">It is quite a problem and as the Court asked previously, it is a problem throughout the entire year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.372" offset="11453440">As the Court well know, Pennsylvania is a monopoly state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.228" offset="11468904">All the liquor must be sold through the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.697" offset="11482697">Our price is far much higher than in any states, of Ohio and New Jersey principally and Washington D.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.916" offset="11515611">And we have traffic coming in from three areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.185" offset="11524702">The principal traffic though is over the bridges from New Jersey into Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.557" offset="11554168">Now there are a couple of other cases, the Galveston versus Point case which was in 1818, and the Court there talks about in a forfeiture case, there must be rightful possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.649" offset="11606518">But a reading of that case will show what the Court would say you must have the property right in it and not the means or methods by which it was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.314" offset="11649254">I think a good analogy in the answer to the questions you've been posing to me, can be found in the Illinois case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.666" offset="11678616">It's in the $4171 in U.S. currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.912" offset="11703589">There, the Court made a very fine analogy in that case and they said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.119" offset="11732428">“Thus, as I the judge, do not have to inquire how a person is before me in an in-persona action, neither do I have to inquire how the arrest was obtained.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.938" offset="11807660">I think that is an analogy there that is very important -- that's in the United States -- the United States versus $4171 in U.S. currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.528" offset="11866070">Now these cases I believe clearly show that the seizure of property, the title to which has been previously forfeited by the illegal act to the United States, stands on an entirely different ground than the Fourth Amendment prohibition in a criminal case of unlawful search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.625" offset="11966485">In the first case -- in the forfeiture case, the title is already in the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.264" offset="11996996">Therefore, the government is entitled to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.122" offset="12008385">Somebody is holding that wrongly there, they're entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.864" offset="12023432">In the other, it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.893" offset="12031478">In the criminal case, they're not entitled to that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.362" offset="12053420">Now one case that's quoted here and quoted by Judge Wyzanski is the Boyd case in the Supreme Court that some 75 years ago, the Supreme Court decided that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.048" offset="12108173">In that case, you have plate glass that the Commonwealth wished to condemn for non-payment of certain importee and the attorney then tried to subpoena the books, documents and records of the person who had the glass.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.592" offset="12214335">That case is entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.418" offset="12221649">We have quoted in our brief from that case and that shows in that case not what the other side which is to show the petitioner in this case, states that searches and seizures of forfeited goods are not embraced within the prohibition of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.964" offset="12299807">Now I stated -- I have five minutes I think and I just like to make a few references to this Berkowitz case in the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.627" offset="12330423">In that case, you had revenue agents who dealt with Berkowitz who was a gambler and some of his cronies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.750" offset="12362919">They saw money passing and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.166" offset="12372637">They made an affidavit to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.145" offset="12388519">They seized the money and the Fourth said you can't do that because there were not enough facts in the affidavit, it was an unlawful search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.697" offset="12426762">Now what the Court does in the -- Judge Wyzanski in that case, he stated this, that where you have contraband, if that contraband was obtained through unlawful search and seizure, you can't forfeit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.012" offset="12512026">Now the minority or the concurring opinion from the case states differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.570" offset="12530207">The concurring opinion seems to state, that you can providing it is against public policy to have that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.019" offset="12580049">Those cases and there is one other case in the Seventh Circuit which states that search and seizure and the prohibitions of the Fourth Amendment apply in forfeiture cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.337" offset="12637309">There of course, they remanded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.713" offset="12642847">The government got the money in that case, so that's never was appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.576" offset="12662282">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="3169.593" offset="12678269">Mr. Shmukler.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanford Shmukler</label>
            <text syncTime="3170.883" offset="12683494">I don't wish to over state my welcome here by exceeding the recess time but I have just several short points I would like to make, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.000" offset="12723931">Mr. Shannon has told us that the Twenty-first Amendment gave the states the right to prohibit liquor traffic and I'm not disputing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.856" offset="12763324">However, even the statute in Pennsylvania set forth in page 2 of our brief, Section 2209, requires reasonable and probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.179" offset="12808673">And as Justice Goldberg asked Mr. Shannon, you do need probable cause even to exam -- to stop the car without a warrant here, under the state statute as well as under the constitutional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.173" offset="12864679">Second of all, Mr. Shannon told us that there are no property rights in contraband and that the driver lost the title to the car when he entered the State of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.661" offset="12922567">To conclude such is to allow an enforcement official to make the exact determination which the Constitution requires to be made by an impartial objective individual in determining whether probable cause has been shown for stopping the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.145" offset="13004487">I think Judge Wyzanski in the Berkowitz case sets this out very well in his opinion, in which he is talking in reference to Section 7203 of the Federal Act and he points out that the Congress cannot preclude the holder of the interest, the possessor of the interest from bringing it in before the court of confident jurisdiction for evaluation and such vindication as it deserves on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.780" offset="13115037">Somewhere in our constitutional regime, so long as it remains constitutional, the holder of the interest has a right to present for adjudication and appraisal by an independent court his claim that his interest has been cut-off by the allegedly unconstitutional application in this case of an act of Congress, in our case, by in act of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.354" offset="13189329">If Mr. Shannon is correct, then any law enforcement official makes that determination exclusively and solely to the exclusion of all court determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.828" offset="13255262">Third of all, Mr. Shannon accused us of quoting only criminal cases in which this doctrine applies and I think the very case from which this old line arises, the Boyd case was itself not a criminal case but a forfeiture case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.659" offset="13322553">Thank you very much.</text>
