            <text syncTime="53.539" offset="214100">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.048" offset="232176">As one of the counsel of record for the petitioner here, Waterman Steamship Corporation, we feel that we have a case with a very limited yet clear issue and result.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.105" offset="296333">We ought to emphasize the issue because if the issue is kept in proper perspective, we believe then that the result will fall as contended by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.199" offset="348787">This is a tax case and we maintain that it concerns the application of the usual rules on the Internal Revenue Code and the 1939 code is the one that controls this case by determining the cost or the tax basis of property, the original price of which property was adjusted downward in pursuant to a statute passed by Congress, which had a limited purpose and which did not have anything in the statute specifying the tax effect which is the issue before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.881" offset="515448">It is not concerned with a tax statute per se, but rather with a general statute with rather limited applications, but with no specified tax effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.358" offset="573336">However, like any other general statute, it may have tax effects and did have tax effects, but again, it's concerned as we see it, not having specific or specified tax effects in the statute that it is then to be determined and controlled by the usual rules of determining cost under the 1939 code.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.989" offset="663928">We do not think that it is concerned with statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.941" offset="679706">We think the statute is rather clear and explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.504" offset="697992">It does not, we think, involve or need a study of the legislative history or legislative environment again because of the face of the statute the meaning and effect is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.519" offset="758073">There are two statutes involved in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.855" offset="771344">One, the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 which was enacted or came into effect on March 8, 1946, after a study over about a 2-year period in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.028" offset="828082">The statute in general related to the disposition after the war, of the vessels that had been constructed and most of them owned by the government during the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.715" offset="874789">Now a subsidiary question arose and that was, what would be done to those persons or those corporations that had purchased vessels during the war at the war time cost and that these vessels that were going to be sold after the war were going to be sold at less than war time cost, what adjustment would be made to those individuals who had purchased during the war at a higher price?</text>

            <text syncTime="250.440" offset="1001744">To accomplish the purpose Your Honor was to get private shipping or to get shipping back into the private industry in a sense that the conclusion of war most of it would have been owned and in the hands of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.666" offset="1050645">Now the question was, what would be the price at which these vessels would be sold to any prospective purchaser?</text>
            <text syncTime="271.970" offset="1087843">Keeping in mind in our case Your Honor, Waterman had purchased 18 of these vessels from the Government during the war and purchased them at their cost during the war.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.483" offset="1257848">Now, it did not specify that it would be changed, adjusted to the price at which they would be sold after the war, but rather the statute set out in one section on the Section 9 which pertain to prior sales, section 9B set out the formula to be followed in adjusting the price of those purchased previously during war time.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.247" offset="1352934">Now, we say here that the statute is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.220" offset="1364846">I don't think there's any arguing with the Government as to how to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.963" offset="1379788">The issue facing the Court here is the effect of that adjustment provided under the statute on the cost or tax basis of these vessels whose prices were adjusted down.</text>

            <text syncTime="395.051" offset="1580199">Now, that's the normal code rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.472" offset="1589812">Now, there's nothing specific in the statute that says that that normal code rule will not apply here.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.385" offset="1697437">Now, we say that thereafter it's a simple matter of mathematics.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.498" offset="1713946">It was stipulated here and agreed what the basis of the property was prior to the adjustment.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.633" offset="1786462">Now, we say though applying the normal 1939 Internal Revenue Code Rule that you will come up here with a basis of approximately $26 million as contended by petitioner as against the approximately $17 to $18 million contended by the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1120.758" offset="4483030">The applicant's indebtedness under any mortgage of the United States with respect to the vessel shall be adjusted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.397" offset="4505496">And the next sub paragraph says, the adjusted mortgage indebtedness shall be an amount equal to the excess of the statutory sales price of the vessel as of the day of enactment of this act over the sum of the cash payment retained by the United States under paragraph one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.852" offset="4575399">Now paragraph one says, you'll pay 25% statutory sales price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.174" offset="4592640">So if you didn't have any trade in, the mortgage would be 75%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.940" offset="4611657">Now if you -- then we get to $17 million by the fact of looking at what the -- let me just turn to the record here, Justice White if you'll turn to page 68 in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.466" offset="4697861">This is a schedule which was attached to the agreement between the government and the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.946" offset="4743732">Actually if you look at page 67 that's a double page there, if you'll notice at the top, original purchase price, line one last column is total all vessels, it has $49 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.592" offset="4802351">Then the next line, less there is no trade in allowance, then, the next line reads less balance of original mortgages up to 03/08/46, that's the day before that shows that the mortgage balance on that day was $30 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.383" offset="4857522">Now, when you take -- then next, you notice, it says less 25% of adjusted statutory sales price, that's the cash you're supposed to pay, then that next line three leaves the excess cash payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.401" offset="4909558">Now if you turn over on 68, it gives the mortgage adjustment, starting with line 13 at the top.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.674" offset="4938606">Adjusted statutory sales price so forth less 25, then line 16 adjusted mortgages as of 03/08/46.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.465" offset="4977789">Then line 20 says reduction in mortgage indebtedness $20 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.343" offset="5005270">Now that's where we get, if you take the $13 million adjusted mortgage in line 16, subtract it from your mortgage indebtedness over on the third line on the preceding page of $30 million, that's where you get to $17 million and it's in accordance with a statutory point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1344.504" offset="5377985">Now, we're not arguing with the philosophy of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.397" offset="5389584">We just say we take the act as passed by Congress and you apply the act, and we don't' argue about the adjustment between us.</text>

            <text syncTime="1439.480" offset="5757910">Well, we pointed out in one of the footnotes, a case similar to that, although actually as it turned out that they didn't adjust it, they wrote a new contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.536" offset="5790093">Now, we say that then the net effect of that adjustment would be determined under the normal rules and that would be the basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.227" offset="5832829">In other words, if you bought it for $100 and it gave a price adjustment of $20 and the new cost would be $80.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.594" offset="5866371">And it wouldn't matter, and this is what we think is a key to Mr. Justice White, it wouldn't matter, how you arrived with the $20.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.893" offset="5895523">You might say now, you earned income of $10, you paid taxes of $2, you had a -- you paid property taxes or something else, or you say I will give you $1 for every child you have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.383" offset="5949440">That's part of the computation and you end up with $20.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.279" offset="5961038">It doesn't matter what the factor that you use to measure the adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.199" offset="5984758">The key thing is the amount of adjustment you apply that to the price and the result is your basis, regardless of how it was computed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.153" offset="6020598">Now that's our contingent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.614" offset="6026449">We say you take Section 9 (b) which has a point made up of several factors of several computations, but it doesn't' matter what they are measured by.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.404" offset="6073574">You take them and as a result of the adjustment, one single adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.994" offset="6099905">You simply either subtract that from the original purchase price to give you a new price or you can do it in a reverse as we we did on this sheet show how much had been paid before, what was the adjusted mortgage indebtedness, the sum of the two would be the basis of property for depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.331" offset="6169287">Now, we do not think that it has any unwinding involved, that was a statute that was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.004" offset="6200007">An adjustments is not an unwinding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.223" offset="6212859">An adjustment confirms the original purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.193" offset="6228741">In fact in the contract itself, this is recognized and in the regulations issued by maritime that they would have to execute an addendum to the original contracts of purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.524" offset="6282031">This adjustment was an addendum to the original contracts of purchase and as we point out in our brief, the original contracts of purchase said that we would have the benefit of any legislation that might be passed after the purchase that allowed the same vessels to be sold as subsequent purchases at lower prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.951" offset="6363742">Now, that was an original contract, but we say that there is not unwinding and we say particular that the table as contained in the brief of the government on page 7 has no basis whatsoever in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.574" offset="6430198">There's no place to determining a gross price adjustment and as we point out in our reply brief, if they want to use the term gross price adjustment as they've done on line 3 on page 7, then they should call the last line the net price adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.011" offset="6496026">That's exactly the -- that's the price adjustment that we receive as indicated in their own schedule one $20 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.025" offset="6532075">That's exactly the price adjustment that we receive, you subtract that from the original price and that gives you the adjusted purchase price and the basis here for depreciation purposes thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.624" offset="6590485">No new mortgages were executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.869" offset="6599471">No new notes were executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.338" offset="6605322">The same mortgages were simply adjusted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.930" offset="6615667">The same notes were simply adjusted as the payment in the future, so that there is not either a rescission nor is there an unwinding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.084" offset="6656313">Now, we also maintain that Section and I might touch on it here, the Section 9 (c) (1) this goes back to Justice White's question, that 9 (c) (1) explicitly provides that this adjustment will be applied against the original purchase price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.888" offset="6735517">This is in the condition section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.732" offset="6746906">The credits that I was discussing with Mr. Justice White are in the adjustment Section, but the condition Section says that you will for federal tax purposes treat as if certain things had not been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.109" offset="6800405">That carried us back to the original purchase price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.943" offset="6819736">You then apply the adjustment on the 9 (b) and you come up with a net result of approximately $26 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.096" offset="6852336">The government would contend that the statute says you must come down to the statutory sales price, but that is not in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.908" offset="6891624">The statute simply contains a formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.178" offset="6904686">The result of which is one adjustment in price, and the result of that to this taxpayer is work it either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.103" offset="6940317">Original cost $47 million adjustment and mortgage indebtedness or in price $20 million a little more, the result a basis or a cost or an economic investment of $26 million or I will look at the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.351" offset="7013355">This taxpayer had paid $16 million the day before this act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.171" offset="7032581">The statutory sales price was only $17 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.221" offset="7048882">Now, it's still old $10 million more after the adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.094" offset="7068317">Yet the government says you're going to have a basis slightly in excess of the cash already paid without looking at the remaining obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.501" offset="7105933">So that we say that anyway you look at it on dollars and cents as Judge Patton said in the Court of Claims in Sekone case, Government is saying it's not a dollars and cents, real actual economic cost, but a hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.483" offset="7169881">And we say that the statute does not require that and that the normal code rule justified the basis in fact is the only result of the basis as contended by the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.508" offset="7238008">Your Honor, there's nothing in the legislative history at all on tax basis, nothing on tax basis and I don't think the government haven't come up with any, we haven't found any.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.499" offset="7285969">We think too that pulling out a context just one phrase in 9(b) about treating the vessel as if it was sold on the date of the enactment of the act and not before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.903" offset="7335602">The government read that in allowing them to do anything to equalize the price depreciation of what not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.381" offset="7377502">We simply say no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.440" offset="7385757">The formula was Congress' idea of exactly how that was being done by treating the vessel as if it was sold on the date of enactment act and not before and the formula carried that out and it's not for the government now to try to change the formula to come back to what they call the Congressional intent or legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.586" offset="7466318">But to answer your question Mr. Justice Harlan on this age Mr. Justice Harlan, we do not think there's anything in the legislative history on tax basis, but if there's a resort to legislative history and we do not think it's necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.934" offset="7515638">We think that statute is clear and unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.843" offset="7531311">There's no necessity to legislative history, but if it is, it supports petitioner, both legislative history prior to that and the legislative history subsequent to the act supports the position of the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.345" offset="7589303">And I would like to reserve the remaining time if I may unless there's some other questions at this time for rebuttal after the government's argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1929.713" offset="7718766">In the course of my argument, I'm inescapably going to have to refer the figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.201" offset="7736738">All of them I think are set out on the chart on page 7 of the Government's brief except for the depreciation figure which Mr. Justice White mentioned in his question earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.395" offset="7781564">I think it will be easier to follow the argument if you have those figures before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.157" offset="7800581">I'll try to make them as simple as possible and round them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.483" offset="7813851">I may have to give some other examples involving different figures in an attempt to make it simple.</text>

            <text syncTime="1962.690" offset="7850736">Well, let me start this way in the few minutes remaining, I would like to try to demonstrate to you why the petitioner's argument as he stated today is absolutely untenable and I would like to do so this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.274" offset="7913012">Referring again to the chart on page 7, petitioner argues and he said it several times in the brief and he says it in his argument that the statute should be read as having no tax effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.258" offset="7972989">Any mention of taxes in the statute just for the purposes of computing the adjustment, but it has no tax effects and he says that no taxes were returned to him as a consequence of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.730" offset="8022831">Well, we think that's wrong and I shall try to demonstrate in the bulk of my argument tomorrow, why the statute does have tax effects and why the fact that the statute has tax effects leads you to the government's results?</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.173" offset="8084689">Well, I should like to take the case first on the assumption that he's right and that the statute has no tax effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.807" offset="8115200">Listen to what his argument is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.990" offset="8123873">He said he paid and he did pay about $47 million with each ships, that's on line 1 on page 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.612" offset="8158354">He got back in one way or another, either by cash credit or reduction of his mortgage about $20 million, $20,400,000, that's the net payment on line 10 on the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.244" offset="8208927">He paid $47 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.550" offset="8214152">He says he got back $20 million, he says his economic investment, then his $26 million, that's the last line of the sheet that he gives you here, remember your graph sheet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.851" offset="8267337">Let's assume that's true.</text>

            <text syncTime="2547.317" offset="10189218">Coming back to the argument, I was making on the basis of the injunction in the act to treat the taxpayer as though he had bought the vessel after the enactment of the act, if you take that literally and if you apply it and if you apply to tax purposes, obviously the basis you would have is the basis you would have had if he bought the ship under the act and the basis would be essentially the statutory sales price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.731" offset="10282841">Now that's very important, because if his basis is higher than that in the years after the statute and he has a competitive advantage over people who bought the ships under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.473" offset="10325891">They would have bought a ship at the statutory price and they would only get depreciation based on the statutory price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.090" offset="10356297">Petitioner argues that he bought the ship beforehand would be in the same kind of ship would be entitled to depreciation on a much higher basis, in this case about $9 million higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.000" offset="10395899">That would mean that if he earned a certain amount of gross income each year, he would have a lower amount of taxable income because he takes the larger depreciation and that would mean comparing him with his competitors on the same amount of gross income, he would have larger after tax then which would be an unfair competitive advantage and it's quite clear that the general purpose of the statute is inconsistent with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.932" offset="10479700">The legislative history which we cite and which petitioner relies on, it says over and over again that the purpose is to put him in the same boat as other people who bought these ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.711" offset="10526824">Now under the petitioner's argument, you can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.803" offset="10539154">Well, what I would like to argue in a constructive fashion rather than the destructive fashion tomorrow is that petitioner -- the reason why the basis in this case is different from the original purchase price of $47 million minus the net return $20 million, is that it isn't like the case Mr. Justice Goldberg gave during petitioner's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.991" offset="10647928">If you bought something for $100 and got $20 back ordinarily your basis would be $80, but in that situation no tax effects are connected with the return of the $20.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.350" offset="10689306">What I should like to demonstrate to you tomorrow is that there's an entirely different result if tax effect, income tax effects are connected with the return of the $20.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.740" offset="10730893">It's possible if all that $20 for example was taken into income by the buyer that it wouldn't have any effect on this basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.712" offset="10766838">On the other hand, certain income tax deductions are associated whether you would have a different effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.332" offset="10785228">Therefore, our argument our constructive argument rests on the premise if there are taxes effects connected with the statute and that by applying the tax effects, you come out with the statutory sales price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.455" offset="10825770">I think it would be better if I start with that tomorrow fresh from our show, if I may, I will stop now.</text>
