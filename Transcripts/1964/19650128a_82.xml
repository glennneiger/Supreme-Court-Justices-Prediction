            <text syncTime="42.162" offset="168647">The Constitution of the State of Texas contains a provision which prevents all servicemen from acquiring a voting residence in Texas so long as they remain in the service.</text>

            <text syncTime="255.398" offset="1021492">And then in March of 1964, he contacted me and I wrote a letter to the Republican County Chairman, asking the Chairman if Sergeant Carrington would be allowed to vote in the Republican County primary.</text>

            <text syncTime="927.854" offset="3711373">It would seem to me that it would be difficult to complain if you were in effect by legislation extending suffrage rights but there seems to be a very big difference when you're in fact restricting them or denying them as they are in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.429" offset="3797682">In summary, let me point this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.977" offset="3811892">The Court well knows that in this country, voting rights are basic and essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.476" offset="3833835">The Court has recently so stated in the apportionment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.000" offset="3851912">The President of the United States in his State of the Union Message said, “I propose we eliminate all remaining obstacles to the right to vote”.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.210" offset="3884826">I mentioned this simply to show that we're living in a time when voting rights are being expanded and not restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.454" offset="3913770">And because this case involves voting rights, it is our position that the respondents must show that some overwhelming public interest will be served by this restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.293" offset="3965074">We feel that the respondents must show that this particular restriction promotes the public welfare to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.495" offset="3997884">And we submit to the Court that the State of Texas has not and cannot present any valid reason for restricting the serviceman's right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.631" offset="4038426">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hawthorne Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="1028.222" offset="4112823">Petitioner in this case is a member of the armed services and contends that Article VI, Section 2 of the Texas Constitution violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.625" offset="4174472">We don't agree with this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.300" offset="4189100">I wish to discuss three basic questions that have arisen in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.558" offset="4210207">First, can a state pass any laws discriminating against the particular class of individuals which I think is fairly elementary, this Court has decided that issue so many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.565" offset="4270184">Second, if the state can pass discriminatory laws where there are any constitutional innovations that would restrict the states on the term -- on determining the qualifications and rules for voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.518" offset="4330057">And third, there's the Constitution of Texas, Article VI, Section 2 arbitrarily and invidiously discriminate against members of the Armed Forces by providing that they may vote only in the county in which they resided at the time of their entry into the military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.964" offset="4415843">Or if you state it another way, as a prohibition of the members of the military service from acquiring residence for voting in Texas during the period of their service, constitute arbitrary and invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.111" offset="4484389">Now this case on the question of the right of this Court on -- question of the right of a state to discriminate has discussed that many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.288" offset="4525140">I think the last time in the case of McLaughlin versus State of Florida in which you've listed quite a number of cases giving rights of discrimination in particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.783" offset="4583131">And in the second question presented, this Court also on many occasions has held that the United States Constitution makes voter's qualifications rest on state laws even in federal elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.649" offset="4650527">Speaking of course Article I, Section 2 of the election of members of Congress, the Seventeenth Amendment in which the election of Senators, the elector's qualifications are based on the qualifications of the electorates to the most numerous House of the State Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.805" offset="4739135">Now, the right of determination of qualifications is limited according to other decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.522" offset="4778005">And I would say now by the Fifteenth, Nineteenth, and Twenty-Fourth Amendments and by the Equal Protection Clause insofar as they might -- there might be arbitrary and invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.035" offset="4840072">The petitioner did discuss in his brief some of the language used by this Court in the -- both the legislative and congressional redistricting cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.511" offset="4885943">I won't go into detail on those but those cases dealt with discrimination in the weighing or denying of the equal weight of the vote of qualified voters within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.727" offset="4934844">Those who were determined to qualify by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.065" offset="4948219">And this of course, I wish to point out is a different situation and that exist -- that existed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.777" offset="4983014">Now I will agree with the petitioner in this case that generally speaking this Court has held in its past decisions that the interest of the public as distinguished from those of a class requires interference and that the means adopted are reasonably necessary and not unduly oppressive on the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.354" offset="5081339">That was held by this Court in the case of Lawton versus Steele, 152 U.S. 137.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.646" offset="5114567">Now, I also wish to point out to the Court that it has been held in the past that when a provision or a law is attacked, that if there any state of facts that would sustain it, then there is a presumption of the existence of that state of facts, and the person assailing that classification has the burden of showing that the Legislation Act -- legislative action is arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.185" offset="5232640">Again, this Court held that the determination of the legislature will not be questioned if grounds may reasonably be conceived to justify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.377" offset="5281437">That was held in one case, Metropolitan Casualty Company of New York versus Brownell in 295 U.S. 580.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.448" offset="5321770">And we can name a number of them on down until recent times in which this Court has held that it's only invidious and arbitrary discrimination with which we're interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.125" offset="5380493">Alright now, historically, we might go back a little.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.367" offset="5401391">States have classified and prohibited certain classes of people from voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.657" offset="5426573">And as has been mentioned, among these people in these classes, and these are each classes are miners, lunatics, women, Indians, poppers, felons, colored people, people not owning property, and members of the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.888" offset="5503478">Now certainly, we have had some constitutional amendments that have eliminated some of these discriminations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.637" offset="5538482">To go back to the time when the Fourteenth Amendment was passed and shortly thereafter, this Court decided the case of Miner versus Happersett in -- reported in 21 Wall. 178.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.890" offset="5599504">In that case, this Court held that Fourteenth Amendment did not grant citizenship to anyone, that the women already were citizens of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.681" offset="5658645">That if the right of suffrage was a necessary privilege of citizenship then the Constitution of Missouri which denied the women the right to vote would violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.045" offset="5712144">However, this was not the case as it was held that the power of the state was supreme to set out the qualifications even in national elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.828" offset="5747252">It was further stated that Article IV, Section 2 didn't confer the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.614" offset="5774420">And if suffrage was necessary like in the incident of national citizenship, then the citizens of each state would be entitled to vote in every other state where they might happen to be just as if they were citizen of that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.219" offset="5832829">Again, just a few years later in 1876, in U.S. versus Cruikshank, the Court held that it appears that the right of suffrage is not a necessary attribute of national citizenship but that exemption from discrimination and the exercise of that right on account of race is the right to vote in the state comes from the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.644" offset="5930527">But the right of the exemption from the prohibited discrimination comes from the United States, the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.390" offset="5961456">The first has not been granted or secured by the Constitution of the United States but the last one has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.676" offset="5986638">Now we feel that these cases are rather significant because as this Court held in the case of U.S. versus Wong Kim Ark in 169 U.S. 649.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.290" offset="6037107">The interpretations by authorities in the field at the relative time that an Act or Amendment was passed should be given even more weight than the debates in the Congress in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.630" offset="6102518">Another contemporary author of that particular time had commented on the Fourteenth Amendment which the Honorable George W. McCrary, Judge of the U.S. Circuit Court of the Eighth Circuit and formerly he was Chairman of the Committee on Elections of the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.773" offset="6171063">He stated in a work that he had published, “A Treatise on the American Law of Elections” which was published in 1875 and again revised in 1880, that the right of suffrage is not a natural right nor is it an absolute and unqualified right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.965" offset="6239817">It is a right derived in this country from the constitution and statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.152" offset="6264581">It is regulated by the states in their power to fix the qualifications of voters as limited only by the provisions of the Fifteenth Amendment to the constitution which forbids any discrimination on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.831" offset="6339291">And then again, in 1887, property plane of the Washington Bar, compared the treatise on the law of elections to public offices in which he commented that accordingly, the right of suffrage is in fact enjoined in the United States as in England only by a minority of members of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.950" offset="6431765">It is in practice held -- withheld from women and in theory, if not in practice, from miners, idiots, lunatics, and criminals which five classes together constitute a majority of the citizens of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.002" offset="6499997">These authorities all held in effect that state suffrage laws could be discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.070" offset="6532180">And except for the Fifteenth Amendment, there was no constitutional inhibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.396" offset="6553496">That was felt necessary that the constitution be amended to prevent discriminate -- discriminatory classifications because of race, trade or color as set out -- or race or previous condition of servitude as set out in the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.673" offset="6630609">And again in the Nineteenth Amendment, we had the elimination of women from the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.095" offset="6672300">Now -- or the states forbidden to place military personnel in a separate and distinct class when they find a valid reason to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1729.536" offset="6918060">I believe, Mr. Justice Goldberg, mentioned some of those earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.400" offset="6933525">You have laws giving military the right to get a pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.505" offset="6957976">You have the -- of discrimination in civil -- in jobs in civil service regulations, and loan preferences, and for example, I think you might also state that in most instances jury service is another area where military men are not required to serve.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hawthorne Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="1782.868" offset="7131429">Mr. Justice White, I'm not contending if that's a reason, just an example to show discrimination does exist in other fields in favor of the military as they are now claiming there is some discrimination against them in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.724" offset="7194854">I think you'll find that historically and this question was asked if there were other states that prohibited or had equal provisions regarding the voting privileges of the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.850" offset="7243337">And Mrs. Wall will discuss that in more detail but I might point out that historically, an early Pennsylvanian case of Chase versus Miller held that the right of a soldier to vote is confined to the election district where he resided at the time he entered the military service, same situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.943" offset="7323690">Again, it was stated in paragraph 71, page 50 of planes treatise on the law of elections, that enlistment in service on the army of the United States do not disqualify an elector from voting at the place of his legal residence but he cannot by service of a military post acquire the residence prescribed by law as one of the qualifications of an elector.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.614" offset="7422433">Also cited in the cases of contested elections in Congress by Clark and Hall as the case of (Inaudible) Richard versus Wayne at page 512 which states that a requirement that soldiers must remain a year after discharge in an area if they wish to vote, if the voting requirement is a one year residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.548" offset="7518145">And it doesn't make any difference how long they might have been stationed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.814" offset="7535177">That they cannot begin to acquire residence for voting purposes until they have been there a year after discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.773" offset="7567047">Now those are a few examples of cases where military classification has existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.610" offset="7598393">I think this Court will concede that this Government, the people of the United States and of all of the states have most jealously guarded against the military taking over the civilly -- the civil government in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.463" offset="7677806">As I understand it, the Constitution of 49 of our states now has some provision in that regard, that the military will be subordinate to the civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.544" offset="7722109">Then we might say, is this discrimination invidious?</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.744" offset="7750949">We would say that it was and I think it was pointed out a little earlier in one of the questions that Texas, I believe Mr. Justice Black asked if this one, the modification of our constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.125" offset="7804447">It certainly is a modification.</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.772" offset="7891069">And shortly after Texas won their independence, the army tried to take over the Government and they were seeking to imprison President Barnett and later when Sam Houston became president, he was able to disperse the army.</text>

            <text syncTime="2841.662" offset="11366609">I want to discuss first the question which Mr. Justice White raised from the bench a few moments ago when petitioner was presenting his argument as to whether the Texas law accords a different treatment to members of the military who entered service as residence of the State of Texas and those who entered as residence of some other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.175" offset="11456679">Now there has been some other passing mentioned of that in subsequent statements of counsel but I want to be sure that this is clearly understood because it was in petitioner's petition for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.160" offset="11524598">There was some confusion in his presentation I believe of whether that was an issue and also in the District Court's opinion in the case of Mabry versus Davis which I -- all of the members of the Court may now be aware of is a case of very similar nature to this one involving essentially the same matters and it is now pending on a -- in a jurisdictional statement for appeal in that case has been filed by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.550" offset="11678198">The District Court for the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas has held that the provision in the Texas law is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.407" offset="11733577">The District Court in its opinion, clearly assumed both in its opinion and in its judgment assumed that the Texas law operates differently upon people who enter a service as a resident of some other state and those who enter as residents of the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.992" offset="11815915">Now the provision in the Texas constitution is that a person in military service may vote only in the county in which he resided so long had -- as he continues to be a member of the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.171" offset="11872653">Now this operates exactly in the same manner upon a person who entered as a resident of the State of Texas and person who entered service as a resident of some other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.925" offset="11923644">If after entering service, that person changes his legal residence to some place other than the place where he had his legal residence at the time he entered service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.345" offset="11973277">The effect is that so long as that person is a resident of the State of Texas, he cannot vote because he may vote only in the county where he resided at the time he entered service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.477" offset="12025835">If the person entered service as a resident of Travis County and is now stationed in El Paso County and has decided that he is going to claim legal residence in El Paso County, he may not vote in Texas at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.281" offset="12089051">If a per -- if -- that is exactly the same effect that it has on the person who entered as a resident of some other state and is now claiming to be a legal resident of the State of Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="4817.353" offset="19269381">I will try to make my remarks as brief as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.755" offset="19286936">In my opening statement, I did mention that I felt that the State of Texas must show that some public interest would be served by this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.226" offset="19320895">Let me just very briefly examine some of the reasons that respondent Carr says justifies this particular voting restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.610" offset="19358407">I think the main contention is that if the servicemen were allowed to vote, they might constitute a majority in some particular county.</text>
            <text syncTime="4848.370" offset="19393411">And then they would exercise complete dominion and control over the local politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="4854.046" offset="19416085">First of all, let me say that I agree with the three judges in the Mabry case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.858" offset="19439386">I don't believe there is such an area where the balance of power would be altered by abolishing this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.405" offset="19465613">But even if there was an area where the servicemen would be a majority and would exercise a complete control over the local politics, they have a right to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.586" offset="19514305">If the majority happened to be members of labor unions in a particular county, they can control the politics.</text>

            <text syncTime="4892.543" offset="19570103">No sir, it surely is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.604" offset="19586403">Another argument advanced by the respondent Carr is that a commanding officer might control the politics himself through pressure and persuasion on his men.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.587" offset="19634260">Well first of all, the federal law prohibits any military officer from influencing votes of the men under his command.</text>
            <text syncTime="4915.630" offset="19662472">Secondly, we do have secret elections in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4918.557" offset="19674175">We vote by secret ballot and any pressure or persuasion that the commanding officer might put on one of his men, could not be so coercive if that man would be prevented from voting his own convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.010" offset="19724016">But once he entered the voting booth or began marking his secret ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.317" offset="19745228">So we do not believe that here is any threat that a commanding officer himself could control the elections.</text>

            <text syncTime="4944.599" offset="19778351">And what about this -- what about this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.901" offset="19791517">Say that there is a -- say that down at Colorado Springs, Colorado there is a camp of 12,000 military men and they're all -- are stationed there for four years and they all qualified to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.856" offset="19843344">They all say we're going to -- just --</text>

            <text syncTime="4965.069" offset="19860271">(Inaudible) that was one of the things mentioned in there.</text>

            <text syncTime="4969.401" offset="19877512">And -- then four years later -- and they also vote of many improvements on roads and things like that, after the camp things like that and then four years later, the camp is closed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4983.275" offset="19933100">If those men were qualified voters while they were there, they have the right to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4988.718" offset="19954834">If they were not, of course they should not be allowed to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4991.901" offset="19967582">But the same thing can happen of course in a civilian community.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.086" offset="19984300">One of the arguments asserted is that servicemen might like a proper concern for the best interest of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="5003.321" offset="20013244">Well, of course this can be set of any group.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.613" offset="20022439">The problem is what group of people can say that another group lacks the proper concern for the best interest of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.578" offset="20058279">The majority of the qualified voters are the ones that should determine what is in the best interest of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="5023.063" offset="20092238">One argument presented was that the petitioner is not typical, that person is in the military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5030.817" offset="20123167">We say that if given the opportunity, there are other servicemen like petitioner who can prove that they're bona fide residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.346" offset="20157336">Another argument was that the classification is not invalid because it results in some inequities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5047.371" offset="20189414">In this connection, respondent, Carr mentioned that the wife can vote whereas the serviceman cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.788" offset="20223060">And he mentioned that this was possibly an over cite.</text>
            <text syncTime="5060.250" offset="20240927">And I got the distinct idea that if the state so decided they could also restrict her right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.263" offset="20269035">And let me submit this to the Court, which group will be next if this voting provision is allowed to stand for the reasons asserted by the respondent?</text>
            <text syncTime="5078.650" offset="20314593">Which group will the State of Texas or some other state find where the members -- where some of the members aren't bona fide residents?</text>
            <text syncTime="5088.422" offset="20353672">Which group would Texas or some other state find where the members might be influenced by somebody in a position of authority or where there are cohesion among members of the group, or where the group, if allowed to vote, might constitute a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.515" offset="20422008">And of course -- then there are other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5108.497" offset="20433920">We submit to the Court if this particular provision for voting restriction is allowed to stand for the reasons asserted by respondent Carr, then there can be and would probably be other denials of the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.362" offset="20497345">Therefore we request the Court to declare this one unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.121" offset="20512392">Thank you.</text>
