            <text syncTime="13.622" offset="54439">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.439" offset="65724">The outset I'd like to point out an error in the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.606" offset="82338">The Government does not now claim that the Board found the petitioner actually arose on the international legal defense in 1932 or 1933, this -- an organization which had its headquarters in Moscow.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.794" offset="143151">While there was considerable evidence indicating this fact, we have overlooked contrary evidence and we think, as the petitioner thinks, that the Board deliberately did not resolve this conflict in the evidence.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="47.168" stopTime="49.745">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="47.168" offset="188604">Where is that in your brief, Mr. Terris?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bruce_j_terris" startTime="49.745" stopTime="278.759">
            <label>Mr. Bruce J. Terris</label>
            <text syncTime="49.745" offset="198949">Well, it appears in the statement we put -- but it also appears at various points during the discussion of the evidentiary questions in several places.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.675" offset="234684">But it's -- I think it's first on page 4 and the footnote on page 4 is where our reasoning, yes in our brief, it's where our reasoning was.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.083" offset="284317">The Board clearly didn't explicitly find it and we thought that it had implicitly found it and we agree with the petitioner that probably even that is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.341" offset="325277">Now, I'd like you to turn to Mr. Justice Goldberg's question yesterday as to the meaning of the aid component of the statute more explicitly whether it requires directly aimed at forcible overthrow of the Government or advocating forcible overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.826" offset="399256">I think I mentioned yesterday that we started from the proposition that Section 3 (4) on its face strongly looks the Government's way because it says that all the Government need to show, to show that an organization is a Communist-front is that it operates primarily for the purpose of giving aid and support to a Communist-action organization, a Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.764" offset="499043">On its face, all that it requires is aid and support and not aid and support of any particular kind of or for any particular purpose of the Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.725" offset="538854">And this is supported by Section 2 (7) which describes Communist-fronts as organizations which conceal the facts as to their true character and their purpose in order to obtain support from persons who would not otherwise give it.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.184" offset="596637">We think it's quite clear that if it was directly aiding overthrow of the Government or advocating overthrow of the Government, not many non-Communists would be in any doubt as to the control of the organization or to its purpose and therefore it would not fulfill this description.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.592" offset="670302">Now, petitioner points to the beginning, the first phrase of 2 (7) that says, well the reason that the Communist-action organization is doing this, setting up Communist-fronts as to aid its objectives under Section 2 (6) and these are forcible overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.102" offset="744385">Well, that's of course exactly the point that I was making yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.685" offset="758700">But this is exactly why they setup Communist-fronts but it doesn't mean that Communist-fronts themselves advocate overthrow of the Government or directly aid overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.555" offset="798198">They do other more immediate things.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.005" offset="811990">And I think this is if -- the legislative history of this statute is extremely lengthy, but I think out of the reading of the -- the both -- both the testimony of the congressional hearings and the debate on the floor of Congress on the prompt provisions is quite clear that what they were aiming at is organizations which are seemingly harmless that seem like the organizations defending the Bill of Rights or civil liberties or the rights of farmers or labor but in fact are controlled by the Communist Party and are in fact are aiding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.130" offset="944483">There's no indication whatsoever that as to Communist-fronts, they are -- that the -- that Congress believed that they directly advocated overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.210" offset="988787">And I may say that that distinction is also clear in the committee report which petitioner's counsel cited to you yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.746" offset="1022955">All that says is that the Congress was not aiming a mere theoretical problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.302" offset="1045107">It was aiming at a problem that was a serious danger to this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.262" offset="1064960">Of course that -- and that again is exactly what I was trying to say yesterday that if the Communist Party was just interested in abstract Marxism, the statute would not have been passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.759" offset="1115011">Do you think that the part of saying is to involve or to have itself engaged, as part of the record, is that the original Communist-action definition?</text>

            <text syncTime="309.313" offset="1237159">I think, an argue could have been made if the Communist-fronts provisions weren't in the statute at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.638" offset="1262550">That the definition of organization in the statute is so broad that it could have covered Communist-fronts.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.478" offset="1289822">The difficulty is that I think it's quite clear by putting in Communist-fronts that the Congress wanted to deal with this type of organization under the Communist-front provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="970.554" offset="3882214">Let me turn to what the evidence is of -- the purpose of what the petitioner was doing and its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.529" offset="3906038">It was not to defend civil rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.706" offset="3918785">First of all, there's the objective factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.173" offset="3924637">A very large proportion of its -- of its -- the people suit, cases it handled involved Communism or some other type of subversion or some dispute whether it's 10% or 50%, it's a very large proportion far more than the proportion of subversion cases and the deportation cases generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.214" offset="4012826">In addition, the petitioner -- again, this is the objective fact, it advocated repeal of many of these statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1017.780" offset="4071027">Now, the Communist Party used these facts in order to show that it's purportedly non-Communist organization was defending Communist Party members and protesting harassment by the Government of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.938" offset="4135706">Now, why did the petitioner do this?</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.261" offset="4148976">Did he do it -- I suppose everything that I have said, the American Civil Liberties Union also has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.034" offset="4184085">A witness testified who was a party to the choosing of the chief officer of petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.509" offset="4213969">The petitioner -- two leading officers deliberately carried out the policies of the Communist Party and running petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.266" offset="4248973">Another witness testified that the third leading officer of the petitioner was acting for the Communist Party when she was an officer of petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.125" offset="4288470">A local branch of petitioner was setup because of the discussions by the Communist Party that it had to have an organization to defend party members against deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.820" offset="4339252">It was setup by -- this branch was setup by a party member under instructions from the Communist Party to do this and then later on this person became the chief officer of the branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.342" offset="4385332">Two other branches were setup, in order for the purpose of defending party members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.393" offset="4413544">Now, it seems to us this evidence takenas a whole establishes not the petitioner happened to defend Communists because he was interested in Civil Liberties but because he was deliberately interested --</text>

            <text syncTime="2143.878" offset="8575478">But to me, when you talk about real reasons as distinguished from the actual objective fact of what you're doing, that relates an ulterior motive.</text>

            <text syncTime="2187.469" offset="8749871">And I must say that it is simply enough -- it aroused my indignation and I really think that the whole thing is an outrage to put it bluntly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.101" offset="8796369">It consist of doing things like putting on a man like John Lautner who -- a Communist who turned an informer and professional witness in the pay of the Department of Justice who knew nothing about the work of the American Committee for the Protection of Foreign Born and he gives it as his opinion, and the Board seriously relies on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.381" offset="8885499">He gives it as his opinion that the purpose of the American Committee for the Protection of Foreign Born is to defend Communists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.966" offset="8915801">Now, as a matter of fact that doesn't even satisfy his definition because of -- it should be, it should have been -- Mr. Wendell Willkie's purpose when he defended Mr. Schneiderman -- to defend Mr. Schneider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.292" offset="8969091">And I may say also that either standards of the Board used in this case for determining this ulterior motive, I don't think Mr. Willkie would have been so well off, because there's evidence in this record that Mr. Willkie not only defended Mr. Schneider, and in the course of that as a lawyer, it was his obligation within the area of his professional responsibility to accept directions from his client to be was going to represent him at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.139" offset="9076506">But I'll tell you what else Mr. Wendell Willkie didas it appears in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.685" offset="9090717">He wrote a letter to Mr. Abner Green the executive secretary of the committee the -- that war of the Government and he said, “Dear Mr. Green, I want you to know that I think you're doing a great job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.012" offset="9135961">Keep up with this work”.</text>

            <text syncTime="2288.235" offset="9152888">It wasn't essential to his representation of William Schneiderman and that is the kind of evidence that they used to determine this -- but I won't say ulterior, this real motive and this kind of thing that you inevitably get into if you go around determining real motive by something other than the objective nature of their activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2353.287" offset="9413068">And Justice Frankfurter have said, “Look, they agreed what the Soviet Union over a best variety of topics over -- over all the years of their existence in regardless of twist and turns” and that was the big deal in the Communist Party case so the Board here makes a finding in non-deviation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2372.700" offset="9490704">It said the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born is opposed to political deportations and political denaturalization as well as every other kind and the Communist Party of the United States is also and this I suppose is a sinister opposed the statute for the deporting of Communists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.862" offset="9559353">And that's the basis of their finding at non-deviation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.003" offset="9571997">Now, talking about funds, there's no suggestion here and no evidence here that the American Committee made any profits from this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.759" offset="9614942">In fact anybody that -- you could read directly, the idea that made any profits is really fantastic or that they ever gave a single penny to the Communist Party or that they had misappropriated funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.995" offset="9667918">And thought about concealment in getting money from non-Communist, how any person who gave money to the American Committee could have been unconscious of the fact that the American Committee would very likely use that money to defend among others people accused of being Communist including people as to whom the accusation even happen to be right, in anyone could believe that their money was not being used for that purpose is inconceivable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2528.321" offset="10113254">Yes, and may I say -- and may I say about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.286" offset="10129136">In the first place, the Board relied on that for its control findings and if you analyze it carefully you will see that that's all that it has to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.193" offset="10160692">In the second place, this episode which -- which was flatly contradicted by Abner Green although you couldn't tell it from the Boards, a version the Court admitted that it is flatly contradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.587" offset="10206250">Even if you believe that this episode happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.896" offset="10219520">In the first place according to Lautner, it happened at neither 1941 and 1942 which is 10 years or 11 years before the beginning of the critical period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.013" offset="10264033">In the second place, it is still doesn't indicate why he was picked -- or why the Communist Party preferred him over another candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.753" offset="10298932">And that there are other objections, allow me to specify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.038" offset="10308127">So far as the aid component is concerned, they rely on Lautner's opinion testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.445" offset="10333727">Now, Lautner may have been an expert on the Communist Party, he was no expert on the American Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.163" offset="10356611">I'd like to say one other thing which is really prompted by a remark that Mr. Justice Goldberg made earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.567" offset="10386181">The fact that I fairly touched on the control of component doesn't mean that I think that we have a weak case on the control of component.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.485" offset="10421917">It's just that there are an awful lot of points here that could be argued and for purposes of oral argument, I just had to be very selective to the point where I couldn't really say much about the controller component.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.331" offset="10469251">But I would like to give you one example, not because of the evidence itself but it's an example of what you face when you get this kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.126" offset="10512405">One of the big items that the Court of Appeals singled out is evidence singled out is evidence of control is that the American Committee in 1952 referred to three decisions of this Court in the alien field and said that those decisions were terrible, they destroyed democratic rights and this Court has deserted its duty to protect the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.408" offset="10625567">And you know what was the special sinister is that the Daily Worker all said similar things about two of the decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.097" offset="10656287">Now, those decisions were Carlson against Landon which upheld the right of the Attorney General to hold aliens choose to be a Communist and deportation proceedings without bail, Harisiades against Landon which upheld the constitutionality of the retroactive Communist deportation statute and the Spector case which upheld the constitutionality of the self deportation law though very narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.156" offset="10772584">In each of those -- each of those cases was sponsored by the American Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.141" offset="10788467">And as a disappointed litigant, I think it had the judicial right of disappointed litigants to go to the tavern and curse out the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.551" offset="10822113">But what the Court overlooked in its hurry to see what the Daily Worker said was what the dissenters said about those opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.632" offset="10858475">Justice Black in the Carlson case said that the majority showed a shocking disregard of the provisions of the Bill of Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.669" offset="10886583">Justice Douglas in Harisiades case said that the majority was repudiating the traditions of -- which underlay the Bill of Rights and I won't take time to quote -- but Justices Jackson and Frankfurter didn't think very much of the majority opinion in the Spector case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.148" offset="10952516">The point is that you get a situation where -- where the Courts are beguiled by this pseudo-historical discussion about in the abstract, about the menace of Communism, some Communist-front though who raises and gives money to the party, it does things which have nothing to do with this record, and the Court gets so beguiled by this theoretical abstract concept that it just departs from its responsibility to review the record in the light of the evidence in the way the Court is supposed to review the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.986" offset="11075918">And that is what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.721" offset="11082815">Thank you.</text>
