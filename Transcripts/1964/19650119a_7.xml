            <text syncTime="34.098" offset="136359">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.297" offset="157153">This case is here on certiorari to the Tenth Circuit to review the judgment of that Court, Chief Justice -- Judge Murrah dissenting, denying enforcement of the Board's order against respondents who are retail food stores in Carlsbad, New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.783" offset="267076">This case and Number 255 which follows it, involves the application of this Court's decision in the Buffalo Linen case which was decided in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.922" offset="311589">In the Buffalo Linen case, as I will explain in greater detail in a moment, the Board sustained the -- this Court sustained the Board's conclusion that the nonstruck members of a multiemployer bargaining unit were privileged when one of their members was struck during contract negotiations to lockout or temporarily lay off their employees in order to protect the integrity of the multiemployer bargaining unit against the threat of the whipsaw strike that this tactic which said in motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.778" offset="543033">The question presented in this case is whether the Board reasonably concluded that the nonstruck of members exceeded the limits of defense of the multiemployer unit and thereby committed an unfair labor practice when after laying off their regular employees in response to a strike against one of their members, they resumed the operations not with their regular employees who were ready and willing to work but with temporary replacements for their regular employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.632" offset="734459">Number 255 which follows does not involve a multiemployer unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.701" offset="766746">The question there is whether a single employer is privileged even though a strike is not imminent to lockout or temporarily lay-off his employees in order to advance his bargaining position.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.733" offset="834873">That question was left opened by the Court in the Buffalo Linen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.585" offset="866325">Now, to turn to the facts of this case, which is as I said before, a multiemployer of bargaining unit situation, the respondents here are members of a multiemployer unit of retail food stores which has for several years, bargained on a group basis with the retail clerks union.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.731" offset="990877">In March of 1960, the parties reached a new pass on a new contract and the union called a strike against one of the stores, Food Jet.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.736" offset="1074887">The four other employers in the unit who operated six stores, treating the strike against Food Jet as a strike against them responded by sending their employees home when they reported to work telling them that they were laid off because of the strike against Food Jet.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.711" offset="1162762">So far, it's still like Buffalo Linen.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.786" offset="1179063">The difference is this, at this point, Food Jet hired replacements for the strikers which they had a right to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="642.450" offset="2569718">8 (a) (1) as the Court knows, makes an unfair labor practice to interfere with restraint or coerce employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed in Section 7.</text>

            <text syncTime="688.542" offset="2754142">Now, this Court has recognized that that is so and that that test is a delicate one and that it's primarily the Board's task in the first instance and if its accommodation is reasonable even though some other accommodation might also be reasonable, the Board's accommodation is entitled to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.108" offset="2852362">Now, the two most recent cases that illustrate that in this Court are the most recent case, the Erie Resistor case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2134.401" offset="8537548">In this case, during the negotiations when the respondents were confronted with the possibility of whipsaw strike, they advice the union and its members that if such strike occurred that they would consider it to be a strike against all respondent members the multiemployer bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.860" offset="8607347">In this case, it is of course the gravamen of the complaint that some use was made of temporary replacements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.269" offset="8637022">The forged brief states that under these circumstances, the respondents could've done one of two things; number one, they could've pulled up their operations during the period of the strike and lockout.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.067" offset="8692193">We submit that this is a wholly unacceptable course of action as a realistic matter, it couldn't be pursued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.028" offset="8720091">We have a respondents who are sitting on perishable inventories who must necessarily furnish a community of food stuffs and it's simply is not realistic to require them to remain close.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.460" offset="8773799">The Board's other alternative is that the employers could continue to operate with their regular employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.740" offset="8802952">We would like to examine each of these choices and demonstrate why they did not provide the respondents with an acceptable course of defensive conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.190" offset="8832731">And we submit in this case that all the action taken was reasonable, was minimal and it was defensive in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.295" offset="8869094">They were all act designed primarily to protect the integrity of the bargaining unit which this Court said in Buffalo Linen, the respondents have the right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.561" offset="8922175">Point one, as to the choice that they could have remained close.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.720" offset="8938789">Here, it's been pointed out the picketed employer, Food Jet, selected to remain open.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.596" offset="8962299">He would, does enjoy a major competitive advantage resulting in the weakening or this integration of the bargaining unit if the other respondents had had to remain close.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.357" offset="9013394">In effect, conduct of this nature could permit the union to place the employers any favorite position, thus drawing the employers away from the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.396" offset="9057489">This result of course would enable a union to accomplish the very objective of its whipsaw strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.704" offset="9082776">In addition to the loss of business, the employers who remain closed would of course suffer losses as I indicated to their perishable inventories and addition would suffer in all probability, permanent losses of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.693" offset="9134707">As to the Board's choice that the respondents could continue to operate with their regular personnel, this effect would be to cause employers to actually subsidize the strike against themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.848" offset="9195311">In addition, we submit that the Board's rationale completely overlooks to stop and start nature of the whipsaw strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.715" offset="9226762">Of course, the whipsaw strike has its very objective placing the maximum amount of harassment and maximum amount of inconvenience and a maximum amount of economic loss on the respondents with a minimum amount of inconvenience and a minimum amount of economic loss to the members of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.427" offset="9309623">If the respondents in this case were forced to continue or to attempt to continue their operations with their regular employees, then this course of conduct would almost to share success of the whipsaw strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.695" offset="9398753">I ask the Court to consider a minute what the effect would be of the start and go or start and stop picketing package would accompany whipsaw strike in a retail grocery operation where the strike could command some stop two, three, four, five, six times a day at peak periods when the store was full of customers when we have merchandise that needed to be unloaded and then on the normal operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.729" offset="9526857">Respondents submit that on the facts of this case, in view of the defensive action that they engaged in that they should be free from the Board's interference in attempting to pick and choose the nature of their response from the pressures of the whipsaw strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.215" offset="9588820">As this Court held in Insurance Agents, it is outside the scope of the authority delegated to the Board by Congress to dictate to the parties to bargain negotiations, economic weapons they may utilize.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.206" offset="9640751">Furthermore, as this Court held in the Buffalo Linen decision --</text>

            <text syncTime="2422.561" offset="9690175">I don't think it has much merit frankly for these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.776" offset="9707102">In both cases, the parties were engaging in collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.202" offset="9728731">In Insurance Agents, we have one in effect was a partial strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.218" offset="9748793">We had a slowing down of the engagement of harassing activities on behalf of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.087" offset="9772304">In this case, we have a strike against the entire employer bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.260" offset="9796963">The picketing may change from employer to employer but in this case as in Insurance Agents we have at all time a partial strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.420" offset="9837610">I simply don't see the distinction of the two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.374" offset="9853492">Insurance Agents was sufficient to control a partial strike situation; we believe that Insurance Agent is applicable here in controlling that issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.499" offset="9909917">Furthermore, this Court held in Truck Drivers Local 449 which is known as Buffalo Linen, the employee's right to strike is not so absolute as to prevent the employers from engaging unreasonable self-help when the legitimate interest of the employers and their employees collide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.193" offset="9980761">We don't see the restriction of the Buffalo Linen case which would say that we can't engage in the reasonable self-help that we engaged in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.498" offset="10013989">In fact, we could read and construe the Buffalo Linen case to give us that absolute right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.374" offset="10037394">I will now discuss the Board's economic parity theory, which for the first time, the Board's urges us before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.606" offset="10078354">The Board for the first time seems to agree that the employer members of a multiemployer bargaining unit are entitled to engage to some degree in self-help to defend their legitimate business interest against the whipsaw strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.687" offset="10134674">At page 13 of the Board's brief, the suggestion is made that the non-picketed employers may put themselves “in the same boat” as the picketed employer by resuming operations with their regular employees either in full or to the extent being appropriate to maintain a level of operations comparable to that of the picketed employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.227" offset="10224849">It has been pointed out in respondents brief at pages 33 to 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.724" offset="10246896">This is a completely -- completely unworkable solution of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.073" offset="10268212">The first question that would arise is the “who is determined the adequacy of the employers responsible of the whipsaw picket strikes?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.427" offset="10301649">Is it the employer, is it the Board or is it this Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.554" offset="10322129">We urge that the adoption of this approach opens a whole new field of inquiry for the board which the Congress has not delegated to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.038" offset="10356088">The second question which occurred is what is a comparable level of operations?</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.849" offset="10379389">First, can the non-picketed employers work only the same number of employees as the number of replacement utilized by the picketed employer or should the percentage of the replacements to the total number of employees be the test or should perhaps the non-picketed employers strive only for the same percentage of the market that they enjoyed before the strike commenced or can the non-picketed employers remain open their regular business hours if the picketed employer remains open in his regular business hours or the picketed employer does not remain open in his regular business hour?</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.675" offset="10514599">Or should the employer remain open the same number of hours each day during the course of the strike, or should the non-picketed employers use all of their employees on a part-time basis their by engaging in a partial lockout?</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.401" offset="10565590">Or should merely some of their employees work on a full-time basis which was still costs due to partial lockout?</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.645" offset="10590563">Or maybe the non-picketed employer's role take their employees you continue to work or must they make a selection and face additional charges of discrimination?</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.137" offset="10624522">These are just a few of the many problems that are inherent in application of the Board's economic parity rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.059" offset="10656183">It's obvious that multitude problems of the kind we mentioned make it imperative to this Court reaffirm the rule that it laid down an insurance agent, the rule that it laid down in Buffalo Linen that the employers are entitled to engage in reasonable self-help to protect their bargaining unit and their legitimate interest from the severe consequences of whipsaw strike, and that the Board lacks the authority to pick and choose for the employers, the economic weapons available to them as a means to protecting themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.301" offset="10773107">The respondents submit that here, they utilize all the limited and reasonable self-help in their attempt to continue their operation on a makeshift basis for the purpose of protecting their legitimate business interests to the service the community with food stuffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.960" offset="10831830">As I point out, these were the principal food stores in the town of Carlsbad, New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.189" offset="10852728">I would state to the Court that some mentioned was made by counsel for the Board, concerning the right to use replacement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.517" offset="10890031">Some mentioned was made for the Mackay case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.062" offset="10896196">We would submit that here or there was no unconditional offer on the part of any employee to resume his work and to disavow or to disassociate himself from the strike action that he and his union was engaging in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.908" offset="10963592">We would submit to the Court that in this case, that the union and its members were on strike against the entire employer bargaining unit that they were therefore active participants in the strike that the strike constituted their collective action, that they voted for the strike, that they participate in decisions, that they reap the benefits and that they therefore must be accorded status as strikers.</text>
