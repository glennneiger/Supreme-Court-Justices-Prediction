            <text syncTime="36.701" offset="146704">I'm Charles Cleveland of the firm of Gordon and Cleveland in Birmingham, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.042" offset="164153">This is my associate, Bryan Chancey at the counsel table with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.122" offset="180454">We represent Jesse Elliott Douglas, who was convicted of assault with an intent to murder in Selma in Dallas County, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.924" offset="215667">He was sentenced to 20 years in prison and Justice Kate wrote an opinion for the Court of Appeals of Alabama affirming this conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.119" offset="252447">The certiorari to this Court has been limited to a consideration of constitutional issues arising out of two factual situations that occurred during the defendant's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.973" offset="311798">During his trial, the prosecutor called an alleged accomplice, Olen Ray Loyd to the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.724" offset="346802">Mr. Loyd had been tried in a companion case on a previous day and a jury had returned a verdict against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.195" offset="380761">He had not been adjudicated guilty but a -- he had given notice that he intended to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.050" offset="412108">This fact was brought to the Court's attention when Mr. Loyd was called to the stand and an objection was made to him being put on the stand at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.890" offset="451500">And this objection was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.222" offset="468846">While he was on the stand, the prosecutor read to him in the presence of the jury a ten-page confession that he had made while he in the Selma jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.202" offset="516807">Now, this confession was not admissible in evidence and was not offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.218" offset="536869">We contend that each of these two factual situations involved two rules of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.664" offset="566648">One of these rules is the rule enunciated by this Court in Mooney against Holohan.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.094" offset="600294">This rule is that where a prosecutor commits such conduct that is prejudicial to the rights of the defendant so as to deprive him of a fair trial that this is a violation of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.816" offset="675213">This rule has been reaffirmed many times by this Court and I've cited a number of cases in the briefs and we contend that this action or each of these two acts of the prosecutor, both in calling Mr. Loyd to the stand and then reading to him this inadmissible document, both constitute such a misconduct on the part of the prosecutor as to prejudice the jury and to deny the defendant a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.660" offset="806557">This rule is based on a premise that the prosecutor is an official of the State and his acts as a prosecutor are particularly susceptible to prejudice the jury if they're not fair and impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.311" offset="885238">Now, the record clearly reveals that the prosecutor had no legitimate reason for calling Mr. Loyd to the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.511" offset="929959">He had no reason to anticipate that he would testify as to anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.627" offset="954410">Mr. Loyd, the previous day, had repudiated his own confession and had refused to take the stand on his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.617" offset="986384">The prosecutor has not made any claim or the State doesn't claim that there was any evidence that the prosecutor felt that he might testify and when he was called to the stand, the defendant's attorney who was also Mr. Loyd's attorney objected to his being called to the stand and told the Court that he would intend to take his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.503" offset="1073946">In spite of this, the Court allowed him to be put on the stand, primarily for the purpose of invoking his rights against self-incrimination which in turn prejudiced the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1151.438" offset="4605701">Then the defendant's attorney did not continue to make objections throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.141" offset="4632555">And the Court of Appeals has held that the failure to continue to make the same objection after each pause and after each paragraph was waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.580" offset="4702250">The other rule of law that we think is pertinent to both of this factual situations is the right of the defendant to cross-examine the evidence against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.131" offset="4744464">It's well settled that the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation includes the right to cross-examine and we contend that this is such a fundamental right that it has embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.974" offset="4799843">The case of Snyder against Massachusetts, Justice Cardozo assumed that this right was reinforced by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.108" offset="4836415">And Mr. Justice Black in -- in re Oliver described this right as basic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.396" offset="4861492">Mr. Justice Douglas has described this right in Willner against the Committee, both in writing the opinions for the majority of the Court as necessary for procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.689" offset="4910707">The highest courts of Washington, Michigan, Florida, and Oklahoma have all indicated that the right of cross-examination is essential to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.487" offset="4953861">And we don't think that it can be seriously disputed that the defendant was denied the effective right to cross-examination -- of cross-examining both the implications drawn by the jury from the -- from the witness taking the stand and refusing to testify on his constitutional rights and the actual contents of the confession that was read to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.720" offset="5054798">And we feel that this right to cross-examine -- cross-examine is so basic that it should be granted under the Constitution, under the Fourteenth Amendment, and that -- when the State call the witness to testify.</text>

            <text syncTime="1396.092" offset="5584353">The primary contention of the State of Alabama is that, we have a question of procedure of whether or not the constitutional guarantee if that -- if warrant was presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.039" offset="5732101">The -- if the Court please, beginning of the Loyd testimony is on page 118 of the record, the Court will note as what Mr. Cleveland pointed out that, if it please, objection was made to the witness being called to the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.265" offset="5905032">Now, that objection should represent no constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.047" offset="5952157">I hope we are not to appoint to whether State cannot call an accomplice to the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.900" offset="6007536">The State must, in many cases, depend largely upon the testimony of accomplices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.073" offset="6064274">I am the misfortuned when I was a defendant's lawyer to be confronted with the testimony of two accomplices who were in State's evidence, so I know that the State must use in many instances an accomplice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.405" offset="6181616">I think the real question in this case though is what actually did happen?</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.055" offset="6240131">What did the record show happened here after this man is called to the stand?</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.090" offset="6328320">First of all, see this -- your objection to the use of the statements, that's on page 119, the objection was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.719" offset="6418808">But the second objection -- objection to the same effect and as Mr. Cleveland points out the Solicitor said, when you have your objection in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.168" offset="6504594">Now, will any defense attorney -- does any defense attorney have the right to go on where the Solicitor, “Did you have an objection here?”</text>

            <text syncTime="1659.342" offset="6637296">Now, I don't know why Mr. Esco didn't object after the beginning of the questions concerning the contents of the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.111" offset="6720366">But suppose he had objected to the first question and suppose the objection had been overruled, surely no -- no constitutional way it would have been presented because there's nothing in the first question which would be even slightly damaging to this defendant.</text>
