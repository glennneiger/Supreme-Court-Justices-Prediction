            <text syncTime="43.290" offset="173140">The Natural Gas Act gives the Federal Power Commission jurisdiction over all sales of natural gas in interstate commerce for a resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.042" offset="232072">The issue presented in this case is whether the El Paso Natural Gas Company can exempt from jurisdiction of the Commission over such sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.984" offset="287869">Gas purchases, large gas purchases it makes to go to its general gas supply and to be used primarily in interstate commerce for resale whether it can exempt some of those purchases by specifying in its contracts with favored producers contrary to the fact that such gas of the favored producers will be used either only within the state of production or outside the state of production but for El Paso's internal uses and hence not for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.920" offset="463621">Now, if the lower court's decision here, if the decision of the Fifth Circuit holding that by this type of contract, gas can be so exempt is upheld, a very serious gap will be created in the comprehensive scheme of regulation of gas sales which this Court talked in CATCO case.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.435" offset="577724">My colleague Mr. Tuttle is going to go into this matter in somewhat greater length and therefore all I want to do is to briefly here discuss some of the potential magnitude of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.248" offset="632895">Our statistics show that with respect to the 40 largest gas companies in the natural gas pipelines in this country, they have on an average of 4% of their total gas supply amounting to approximately $85 million worth of gas each year which they consume and utilize in their own operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="295.163" offset="1180630">I want to make also clear that that's only one part of the potential involved in this case because the other aspect of this case, if the Court's decision below is valid would be to exempt or they could exempt by contract all purchases from producers in one state which they resell in the same state.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.929" offset="1267670">I can't give you the figures as to how large an amount of gas would be exempted here, except to say it's very large.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.833" offset="1299331">And in the case of El Paso, we're pretty sure it would at least be possible for El Paso to exempt the $10 million worth of sales that they make in New Mexico on the theory that they bought that gas from New Mexico producers whereas in fact a very high percentage of gas used in New Mexico comes from Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.179" offset="1384699">Now, the facts in this case are not in dispute and I think for purposes of the Court, it may be useful to refer to a map in the big record, Volume I of the record and this map appears at page 115 at the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.001" offset="1455961">At the top, it's called Exhibit 6 or in front, this is 485, the transcript page.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.607" offset="1486367">It isn't too good a map but it's the best we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.048" offset="1504131">First, to refresh the Court's recollection, El Paso of course is one of the major natural gas pipelines in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.434" offset="1541642">Its primary business is purchasing gas largely from the West Texas, New Mexico field known as the Permian Basin and transporting that gas west together with other gas that it purchases in New Mexico along the way, transporting that gas west through New Mexico and Arizona to the California border where of course most of the gas is sold for resale in the very large California market.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.740" offset="1670896">In addition, they sell gas for resale in New Mexico and Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.729" offset="1698900">They don't seem to sell very much resale in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.125" offset="1728470">Up to the time of this case, El Paso's operations in Texas were pretty much confined to the west Texas area around the Permian Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.665" offset="1774655">And as you all examined from looking at this map, there was one extension, the green line here which got over as far as Sonora but most of their operations and most of the in-gathering of gas in Texas was in the west Texas area of the Permian Basin.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.280" offset="1845081">Now, this case has its origin in El Paso's attempt to tap the very large east Texas gas markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.979" offset="1895863">This, they proposed to do by building a 227-mile pipeline east, that's the dotted red line in this map from Sonora, their present eastern terminus to the town of Three Rivers in the heart of the east Texas oil and gas field and in order to at least start their operations in east Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.292" offset="2025117">They contracted to buy gas from the other two respondents here.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.477" offset="2041835">They contracted to buy 100,000 mcf of gas a day from the Lo-Vaca Gathering Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.370" offset="2077466">And they contracted to buy 70,000 mcf a day from the Houston Pipeline Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.282" offset="2109127">These are large amounts of gas purchases but not tremendous.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.974" offset="2127830">Now, the physical operation of this system if this deal has been consummated, if this deal is consummated, will be that both Lo-Vaca and Houston will insert their gas into this system at Three Rivers and this gas will flow west through a new plant, the Coquat Station where some of the gas will be utilized through the existing Sonora plant, on west, when it gets to this meeting point here about halfway through, it will split it into two other lines but those two lines will also go west and eventually those lines, both of them will go into first, New Mexico and then Arizona and then seem to join I think eventually and go to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.663" offset="2370560">Starting at Sonora and increasing as you get into the Permian Basin area, you have other gas sources coming in to the El Paso system.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.673" offset="2422596">So that by the time you get into the west Texas areas over here, the gas mix is largely other gas and very small parts of it are Lo-Vaca gas or Houston gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.027" offset="2484036">Apparently, however, El Paso found great difficulties in getting either Lo-Vaca or Houston to contract with them if they are going to subject themselves to the Federal Power Commission's regulation over the rates of their sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.996" offset="2547984">And therefore, what El Paso did was first to contract with Lo-Vaca for a sale of 50,000 mcf of gas, later raised to 80,000, which was allegedly to be used by El Paso not over here in Texas, not even in the Permian Basin but the gas from El -- that they were buying under this alleged restricted used contract is going to be used -- it's going to be used off this map entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.612" offset="2694374">It's going to be used to the west of this map, allegedly, in El Paso's compressor stations and other equipment in Arizona and New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.495" offset="2745887">And similarly with respect to Houston, the contractual provisions --</text>

            <text syncTime="763.044" offset="3052147">Both as I said Justice Harlan, both Lo-Vaca and Houston as well as El Paso have admitted on this record that in fact this gas becomes just part of the general El Paso scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="784.821" offset="3139187">And in fact, in decreasing -- increasing amounts, these restricted uses actually will not be fired by Lo-Vaca gas or by Houston gas but will be fired by the generality of the gas which El Paso takes into a system, a very small percentage of it which comes from these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.716" offset="3238766">And this is not, I submit, merely a matter of physical fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.815" offset="3259246">It's also a matter of economic fact because it's perfectly clear that El Paso was not going to bill the costly 227-mile gas line halfway across the State of Texas in order to buy gas in -- what in east Texas, at prices substantially higher than it was paying in West Texas in order to get fuel for its plants in West Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.021" offset="3380036">What El Paso was doing and what this case is about is breaking into a new market and finding that for its own reasons which I'm sure the El Paso people thought were good, that it had to pay more money than probably the Commission would allow and therefore trying to, by contract, take these packages of gas out of the jurisdiction of the Commission.</text>
