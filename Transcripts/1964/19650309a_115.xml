            <label>Mr. Edward Jacobson</label>
            <text syncTime="29.377" offset="117447">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.735" offset="130926">This case comes on appeal from the Arizona Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.995" offset="147958">It presents one question only of law, a question of first impression to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.465" offset="173767">The question is whether a state may impose a license prohibition and a privilege tax upon a federally licensed Indian trader for the privilege of his engaging and making retail sales from his trading post on the reservation to reservation Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.027" offset="248059">By stipulation, there is excluded from this case any question of off reservation sales to Indians or others.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.738" offset="282854">Equally excluded by stipulation is any question of on reservation sales to non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.608" offset="314410">The case comes to you with undisputed facts yet the history surrounding these facts, I shall briefly give, because I think it's important to put the action of the Arizona State Tax Commission into context.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.517" offset="390060">Since 1876, the Congress of the United States has given to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs the sole power and authority to appoint traders to the Indian tribes and to make such rules and regulations as he may deem just and proper specifying the kind and quantity of goods and the prices at which such goods shall be sold to the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.233" offset="480862">The appellant in this case, the Warren Trading Post is such a federally licensed Indian trader.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.298" offset="505104">Its trading post is at Kayenta, Arizona that is on the Navajo Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.887" offset="531540">It is on the south border of Monument Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.000" offset="543974">It is in Navajo County, Arizona and it rents its premises from the Navajo Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.484" offset="569887">Pursuant to this congressional action, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs has issued a number of rules governing many and we think most phases of Indian commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.816" offset="615236">In the spring of 1935, the Arizona legislature passed a Privilege Tax Act not unlike that of Illinois and several other states levying a gross privilege tax measured by gross proceeds of sales on a variety of occupations including for our purposes the occupation of retailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.479" offset="693812">In 1940, the Assistant Solicitor wrote an official opinion for Mr. Oscar Chapman, the then Assistant Secretary of Interior with specific reference to the Arizona Privilege Tax stating that it should not apply to federally licensed Indian traders making sales to Indians on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.395" offset="781479">That opinion was honored until the assessment made in this case in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.181" offset="808647">In 1958, the Arizona State Tax Commission under the privilege tax section which levies a tax on retailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.959" offset="843755">And pursuant to a rule which it had adopted two years earlier which said that this section shall apply also to Indian traders levied an assessment of $2800 odd dollars on the Warren Trading Post.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.795" offset="895164">This was the first time in the 23 years since 1935 when the Arizona Privilege Tax went into effect that anybody had tried to tax a licensed Indian trader on these kinds of sales not alone in Arizona but in the other 24 states which happen to have Indian reservations lying in whole or in part within their boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.159" offset="988578">Since that time, however, both the State of New Mexico and the State of California had taken similar positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.476" offset="1013864">The State of New Mexico's case is now pending before their Supreme Court by stipulation to be determined in accordance with the opinion of Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.728" offset="1046883">The California position is reflected only in a recent opinion in 1958 of the California Attorney General, reversing a previous opinion to the contrary, his action also having been taken after the move made by Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.839" offset="1107278">In October of 19 -- in August of 1958, my esteemed and deceased partner Perry Ling brought an action for declaratory judgment in the Superior Court of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.305" offset="1153149">The Superior Court held against Warren and for the State Tax Commission, basing their opinion on Thomas versus Gay finding no difference between a tax on an Indian trader's stock in trade and a tax on his right to engage in commerce the one came under Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the constitution and the other did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.649" offset="1238518">The Arizona Supreme Court in December of 1963 sustained the superior court but on a slightly different ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.728" offset="1266834">It found that so long as a law was neither in consistent with or burdensome to federal purposes, it could operate coexistent with federal law and found as a fact this tax to be neither inconsistent with or burdensome to federal purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.354" offset="1333394">There was a long dissent filed by now Chief Justice Warren (Inaudible) one of our court adopting the view of the appellant Warren Trading Post and on October 12 of 1964, this Court noted probable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.366" offset="1385430">Our case rests on three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.414" offset="1397656">We believe anyone of which independent of the other should sustain the position that the Arizona Supreme Court should be reversed and that these kinds of sale should go tax free.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.322" offset="1453244">Very briefly, the three points of these, first, we believe that the national character of Indian commerce like the National Character of Interstate in Foreign Commerce is such that were there no federal regulations whatever the field should be left clear for federal regulation at such time as it should choose to occupy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.617" offset="1550420">Second, that as a matter a fact, the field of Indian commerce has been heavily occupied with both congressional action and rules adopted by the Commission of Indian -- Commissioner of Indian Affairs pursuant thereto so that there is no room left for state action that would not be contradictory thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.248" offset="1632967">Finally, that there resides in the Indian tribes a degree of sovereignty as this Court announced in Williams versus Lee, a degree of internal sovereignty which can be impinged upon by the states only upon specific authorization of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.801" offset="1719171">We believe any of the three points sufficient to justify our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.802" offset="1739128">Going back to the first one every briefly, we believe that the National Character of Indian Commerce is equal to the National Character or greater than that involved in interstate and even perhaps foreign.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.257" offset="1792940">In the decision of Dick versus The United States written by Mr. Justice Harlan, this Court took much the same position although not related to a privilege tax but related to Indian commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.319" offset="1837244">We believe the reason for the National Character of Indian Commerce relates to its purposes and goals highly related to the purposes and goals of the other two fields namely the economic development of the Indians as set forth by this Court in Williams versus Lee, the congressional legislation points to making the tribes both self reliant and economically self-sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.376" offset="1937450">We think this is the sort of thing that can best be done and perhaps only be done by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.340" offset="1961273">We believe the geography of the situation alone is an argument in this favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.239" offset="1984888">For example, the Navajo Reservation with which we happen to be concerned today stretches across three states, Arizona, New Mexico and the Southern part of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.592" offset="2022296">Not given to the independent regulation we would think of the 25 separate states which contain all or part of an Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.336" offset="2065241">The occupation of the field we believe to be so great that even if the first premise were denied and we present these arguments both alternately but at the same time believing in all three as an independent basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.644" offset="2130547">We believe the occupation of the field so substantial that there is no room for state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.903" offset="2159595">In this Court's decision, the Pennsylvania versus Nelson, you've set down several rules for determining whether a field had been federally occupied in its totality.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.339" offset="2205257">The last of these rules I think is interesting in view of a recent advent on the Papago Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.553" offset="2230126">The last of the rules is with the enforcement of state laws present a serious danger of conflict with the administration of federal justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1011.856" offset="4047412">The Buck Act by its terms refers to a federal area and is operative only in a federal area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.375" offset="4081476">I'm looking at page 84 of Appendix A of my brief at the subparagraph E at the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.185" offset="4108643">The Buck Act defines federal area as to mean any lands or premises held by or acquired for the use of the United States, held by or acquired for the use of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.994" offset="4159948">Now in the one decision on this specific point, a decision of the New Mexico Supreme Court a case entitled Your Food Stores versus Espanola.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.676" offset="4198609">They held the Buck Act not to apply to Indian reservations for the reservation was not a federal area as here defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.309" offset="4233195">For example, in the Espanola case and in Mr. Felix Combs book, they discussed the fact that many reservations are really held by the United States in trust for Indians, others are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.092" offset="4280320">Oddly enough the Santa Clara Reservation in the Your Food Stores case in New Mexico is held by a patent in fee granted by the Congress of the United States confirming a direct grant from the King of Spain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.903" offset="4327549">Then you get to the other half of the sentence for the use of the United States and there the law is absolutely solid that Indian Reservations including those held by the United States in trust are not held for the use of the United States but rather for the use of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.529" offset="4398080">The state also raised the question in its brief as to whether or not the legislative history of the Buck Act did not oppositely suggest from that which I have answered you and we did go to the legislative history and set forth the fact that the three amendments submitted first by Mr. Burlew, then acting Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.037" offset="4488046">The second find Mr. Dixwell Pierce, I believe the Executive Secretary of the California Board of Equalization and the third by Senator La Follette who at the time was one of the three men in the subcommittee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.489" offset="4533917">Each of those amendments was designed and the discussion indicates it and our reply brief sets this out in full, designed to keep the status quo of taxation on the Indian Reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.486" offset="4581878">Well, in 1940, the status quo was privilege taxes would not be levied on sales by Indian traders to Indians providing on the reservation and providing they were reservation Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.621" offset="4634436">Finally, just after the Buck Act is passed Mr. Justice White, three years later in 1943, the Department of Interior gave another formal ruling.</text>

            <text syncTime="1381.607" offset="5526361">I think Mr. Justice Black that to the extent the Supremacy Clause is deeply related to the internal sovereignty of the Indians which still remains it would raise the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.210" offset="5588741">My attempt to avoid the question directly was only because I had not given that kind of consideration I would like to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.735" offset="5630851">In conclusion, let me state that I think that there may come a time when a privilege sales tax by the states should be imposed upon Indian traders on the Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.572" offset="5698247">I think the time will come separately for different Indian tribes and separately for the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.746" offset="5726981">It will probably come more rapidly for wealthy tribes which we do not happen to have in Arizona in which we are told it exists in some other states like Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.918" offset="5767628">We think it will come more rapidly for states that have undertaken to do more for the Indians and give a quid pro quo, such as was pointed out in Williams versus Lee when this Court suggested that Arizona had refused to do even those things which would permit its state courts to have civil and criminal jurisdiction perhaps because it could not afford to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.438" offset="5857698">So we're not saying that there should never be a privilege tax on Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.272" offset="5873058">What we are saying instead is that this is a federal question which should be federally determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.354" offset="5901375">It is a clock and a time table which should be read by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.407" offset="5921541">We would suggest that if this Court were to decide that 25 separate states which now have Indian reservations could now engage in 25 separate kinds of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.615" offset="5970442">The Court would be faced with the problem that either deciding the states could do the same thing with respect to foreign commerce and interstate commerce or else they would have to find that somehow the Indians and their problems and their destinies and their futures were less national in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.220" offset="6048810">We submit that is not the fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1520.688" offset="6082664">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.477" offset="6093845">If we were talking about Indians I think much about Mr. Jacobson has said would be most pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.339" offset="6121326">But I don't think we're wrong we're talking about as Mr. Goldberg pointed out in Arizona Corporation, doing business in the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.610" offset="6154344">I think the briefs point out there are approximately 169 traders involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.045" offset="6176078">There are 30,000 to 40,000 businesses in the State of Arizona subject to the transaction privilege tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.542" offset="6206067">If we were talking about he history and the background of the Indian tribes themselves, that would be important because as I say we're not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.259" offset="6233025">We're talking about a business selling across the country like any other business in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.810" offset="6259148">Mr. Justice White inquired that we issue a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.902" offset="6271582">Yes, we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.767" offset="6279001">We issue it on demand there are no qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.126" offset="6288405">It costs $1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.191" offset="6292689">It is a perpetual license.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.087" offset="6300317">One is required for each individual physical establishment but that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.590" offset="6318289">We do not regulate by the privilege license tax anymore than other states regulate because everyone in business must have one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.535" offset="6358100">The principal reason for it is administration so that the State Tax Commission knows who is in business to whom the forms are to be sent each month and to collect the taxes if they are not promptly returned in accordance with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.570" offset="6414211">But it is not a regulatory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.553" offset="6426122">I think this Court in the Richfield Oil case made a very important distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.979" offset="6451827">In that case, I believe the State of California attempted to post a tax on what was a export out of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.952" offset="6483801">An exemption was claimed under the Commerce Clause and under the Export-Import Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.337" offset="6513267">And Mr. Justice Douglas carefully pointed out the distinction between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.767" offset="6531030">The Export Clause just flatly in the constitution prohibits the state from laying a duty or imposed on exports or imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.811" offset="6563213">And as the decision points out, one speaks of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.226" offset="6584842">The other speaks of regulation, the other being the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.895" offset="6599576">One is a prohibition to the states against this taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.025" offset="6616085">The other is a grant of power to Congress in the area of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.284" offset="6641058">At various times under the Commerce Clause, state taxes had been held to violate the Commerce Clause because they had interfered with interstate commerce itself but the norms of this Court is laid down have come to basically two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.287" offset="6713051">Is it an undue burden or is it discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.261" offset="6733009">Discrimination is obviously not an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.724" offset="6750877">The issue of whether or not this is an undue burden on the Indian traders has not been raised by the traders, certainly it is attacked.</text>

            <text syncTime="2972.592" offset="11890312">The trading post is at Kayenta, Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.092" offset="11904313">Kayenta, Arizona was a remote area until about a year and a half ago when one of the most beautiful roads in America running from Northern Arizona across to Colorado called Navajo One was opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.639" offset="11970456">Kayenta is on Navajo One.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.900" offset="11979546">It is at the edge of Monument Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.388" offset="11989473">The trading post itself by doing a little fast mathematics and looking at the fact that a 2% tax for approximately a year netted a $2886 assessment grosses at about $140,000 a year from a 20x30 room in which they sell the necessities of life to the Indians range all the way from food to harnesses and seed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3030.088" offset="12120294">What do you -- you say that his statement is that Congress has not forbidden this, it has to be assumed they have permit it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward Jacobson</label>
            <text syncTime="3037.659" offset="12150596">Mr. Justice Black, I think that is the heart of the disagreement between the State of Arizona and myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.367" offset="12185391">It is the position of the Warren Trading Post that Indian Commerce is closed to state regulation without Congress having forbidden it by the constitution just as interstate commerce is closed to state regulation by privilege taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.033" offset="12268042">I must confine my remarks to that because that is our arena.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.859" offset="12283402">It is my understanding different from Mr. Haggerty that there has never been permitted by this Court a privilege tax of a state to be laid directly on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.657" offset="12334602">I do appreciate that this Court has gone beyond the Specter case both in the Norton and in General Motors versus Washington in finding more and more local incidents at either end of the interstate commerce upon which a privilege tax maybe laid but the way I read the cases, never has this Court permitted one directly on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.784" offset="12427076">I believe Mr. Haggerty mentioned the International Harvester case which if I remember the facts correctly was a sale completed entirely in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.759" offset="12470962">It is true that the purchaser intended and probably did transport the goods elsewhere after he had completed the purchase but that then was a totally local Indiana activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.734" offset="12526864">And so again, in answer to your question, it is the position of the Warren Trading Post that the arena of interstate commerce -- of Indian commerce is an arena that is free and clear from state regulation by privilege taxation whether or not there were conflicting statutes of the United States Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.871" offset="12627383">Additionally, we believe this arena has been occupied by the conflicting statutes of the Congress and the rules adopted by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs pursuant therewith to a degree way beyond the occupation of the arena of -- for illustration, interstate or foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.776" offset="12711079">And finally, we believe that Indians and Indian tribes retain a measure of sovereignty spelled out in Williams versus Lee that can be described about as follows starting before and with Worcester versus Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.974" offset="12779833">They had the sovereignty of an independent nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.772" offset="12794984">Thereafter by conquest their external sovereignty was eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.889" offset="12819540">Their internal sovereignty to my understanding of the law remains but for those inroads into it which the United States Government may take.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.632" offset="12866456">The only action as I read the law that a state may take without the specific permission of the Congress relating to Indian Reservations are actions which do not whatever affect what remains of the Indian sovereignty those need no congressional assent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3288.337" offset="13153280">Now then the counterpart is that the Congress of the United States did for illustration authorized all of the states containing Indian Reservation to have civil and criminal jurisdiction provided they would do a variety of things.</text>

            <text syncTime="3485.714" offset="13942805">Number two, it has been heavily occupied beyond the other two areas of commerce discussed in the constitution.</text>
