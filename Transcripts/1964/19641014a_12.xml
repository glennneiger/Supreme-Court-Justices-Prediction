            <text syncTime="40.818" offset="163213">Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justice of the Court, this case involves an interpretation of an act of Congress which relates to examinations and investigations of taxpayers by the Commissioner and his agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.936" offset="343667">The particular part of the act of Congress with which we are concerned states restrictions on examination of taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.348" offset="429349">No taxpayer shall be subjected to unnecessary examination or investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.485" offset="461845">And only one inspection of the taxpayer's books or accounts shall be made for each taxable year, unless the Secretary or his delegate after investigation notifies the taxpayer in writing that an additional inspection is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.077" offset="560274">The precise question concerned here is whether this act of Congress, this section of the statute, requires that an internal revenue agent should establish to the satisfaction of the District Court that a reasonable basis suggest for a suspicion of fraud or probable cause exist to believe the taxpayer was guilty of fraud in order to justify the enforcement of a summons issued by the agent to the taxpayer to produce his books and records and testify for years which are barred by all statutes of limitations and open only in the event of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.320" offset="789211">The facts in this case are that the taxpayer, Bayard Edward Ryan of Maysville, Kentucky filed timely his federal income tax returns for the years 1942 to 1953 inclusive, and reported a sizable amount of income for those years.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.729" offset="894851">An examination began by a revenue agent of the Commissioner sometime in 1960 of the returns for 1954 to 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.403" offset="953574">At the time I believe of the hearing in the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati, the case for the years 1954 to 1958 had been settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.044" offset="1016163">The agent thereupon began investigation of the years 1942 to 1953 and issued a summons requiring the taxpayer to produce the records for those years and to appear and testify.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.584" offset="1118250">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, when we stopped I had stated that the taxpayer had received the summons from the revenue agent and he appeared -- but did not produce his books on the advice of counsel on the basis that the assessment of the taxes had been barred by all statutes of limitations except by fraud and he requested on the advice of counsel that some indication be made of the existence of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.680" offset="1254713">Thereupon a complaint was filed in the District Court, in the Eastern District of Kentucky, and the agent alleged that the taxpayer had the books and records for the years 1942 to 1953 in his possession and that the agent had made an estimate of the network assets of the taxpayer and therefore there was a strong suspicion of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.574" offset="1350217">The basis apparently of the complaint was that the examination was relevant and material through his examinations for the years involved, 1942 to 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.902" offset="1399536">The taxpayer filed an answer alleging that the books and records for all the years involved were not in existence and that neither were the filed income tax returns in view of the fact that the Congress itself ever so often orders the destruction of individual income tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.202" offset="1504758">The trial was held in the District Court and the District Court took the position and made the ruling that there was an automatic and arbitrary right of the agent to have the books and records of the taxpayer for the years 1942 to 1953 irrespective of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.170" offset="1612591">He held that fraud was not a matter of concern because the statute 7602, gave the agent the automatic right to any books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.474" offset="1669851">At the trial of the case however, it was showed that -- it was proved that the books and records for the years 1942 to 1946 were not in existence and part of the books for 1947 and 1948 were not in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.259" offset="1736934">And that -- it was further revealed that the income tax returns themselves for the years 1942 through 1950 were no longer in existence and that the only returns in existence were those for 1951, 1952, and 1953.</text>

            <text syncTime="495.314" offset="1981231">It was the order as rendered by the Court, and the ruling during the trial was that irrespective of the fact the returns were not in existence and irrespective of the books the order should be that it would cover all books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.961" offset="2047791">The Court apparently did not give any consideration at all to Section 7605 (a) or (b), (b) being the requirement that the examination be necessary or putting it the other way that an examination, an unnecessary examination should not be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.206" offset="2148728">They gave no consideration whatsoever to that part of the statute, but followed strictly Section 7602 which said that an examination could be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.904" offset="2195540">The books could be had if the examination were relevant to the books and records.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.589" offset="2366276">The only question involved is whether the agent has the right to these books and records for the years involved where the statute of limitations have expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.914" offset="2419566">Now you have two statutes of limitations, a three-year statute of limitations which is ordinary expiration.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.947" offset="2471706">You also have the six-year statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.518" offset="2482051">During the six-year period after return is filed, the Government may set up additional income if the taxpayer has omitted 25% of his income shown in his return.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.127" offset="2552477">The -- there's also the six-year statute for criminal prosecution and we don't have that here involved, but it appears that the Government has argued in its brief that by not allowing the agent to have these books and records for these years that we are restricting him unnecessarily because that's when he needs the greatest ability to get to the facts about the taxpayer's income.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.757" offset="2723004">However, they threw together the fact that they said in their brief that criminal and civil while the constitution itself or the Fifth Amendment gives the taxpayer the privilege if he feels a prosecution is eminent and he has committed a fraud, he has the privilege to keep his books and records and refuse to give them to the Government agent.</text>

            <text syncTime="777.071" offset="3108258">We objected to the order on the grounds that it should not have covered the years during which there were no books.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.169" offset="3140650">But the Court said that -- at a later time when the agent made the request for the books then it -- there was a chance -- the opportunity to say, “Well, I don't have those books and therefore I can't comply.”</text>

            <text syncTime="817.314" offset="3269172">Section 7602 is the one which gives the agent the power to secure the books and it was incorporated in the law prior to 7605.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.041" offset="3316088">7602 apparently created -- a bit of a trouble because of the fact that at that time there were some agents who were apparently taking advantage of this great power which the agent had of bringing in the taxpayer and ordering him to bring in his books.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.818" offset="3403233">Thereupon Congress receiving a great many letter complaints from taxpayers throughout the country and must be realized that this is in the early stages of the income tax law and that 1921, the Court -- the Congress passed this statute which said that the examinations should not be made of the taxpayers' books unless there were some necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.864" offset="3539383">The words of the Congress were that no taxpayer should be subjected to an unnecessary examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.396" offset="3561535">Now this Section was passed because of the complaints of taxpayers to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.307" offset="3585149">And obviously the Congress had probably discussed the matter of protecting taxpayers with the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.697" offset="3618691">And normally under the 7602, the restriction of an agent would be by administrative treatment that is if the taxpayer had a complaint he would take it up or perhaps pay now to the district director or with the Commissioner himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.954" offset="3687758">But that's a rather slow process and the Congress realized that the taxpayer wanted real protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.961" offset="3707820">He had to be protected right at the time that the agent knocked at the taxpayer's front door.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.998" offset="3731958">So the Congress passed this, Section 7605 to give the taxpayer the protection that he needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.372" offset="3769469">Now if it doesn't mean that, it's absolutely superfluous, it's unnecessary because the government agent already had the authority to demand the books through 7602.</text>

            <text syncTime="1121.972" offset="4487837">Now after the open years it's a different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.076" offset="4508212">You have the statute of limitations which bars the collection of the tax, and unless there is fraud, unless there is suspicion of fraud that is, there could be no reason to make an examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.812" offset="4555233">During the open years they have the reason that under this self-assessment system, not only the taxpayer should welcome an examination because they often get an overpayment, get a refund.</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.904" offset="5283527">Now, if they had anticipated that they wanted a spot check as a routine thing, years would be barred except open by fraud and that -- and one must not forget that we have the six-year statute put as open, but there's a 25% omission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.645" offset="5350504">This is beyond that where the years are barred except by fraud that the Congress itself has destroyed the returns, I believe up through 5th -- 1955, well that's eight years from this particular period now, not from this case involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.673" offset="5430648">Therefore, they themselves revealed an intent that there should not be spot checks because it's a waste of the Government's money to go out and make spot checks unless they have some in hand to show fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.992" offset="5491879">Because there again, the Congress has placed upon the Government a burden, they have the burden of proof in the case of fraud penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3844.819" offset="15379226">What they do show is that this basic power given in Section 7602 to issue summonses that that power does not require any showing of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.323" offset="15429277">That all we have to show is as the statute says that the records sought are relevant and material, but that -- that that's the basic scheme for administrative agencies in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="3892.755" offset="15570965">And I may say what -- there is significant in Martin Salt Company, the administrative power is analogized to the power of the grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="3929.210" offset="15716833">Then we get to the two sections of the code which are argued by the taxpayer to limit this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.262" offset="15745045">And it seems to me here that theses decisions of this Court established that the taxpayer then has the burden of showing that in this field, Congress has done something different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.546" offset="15794155">It is more narrowly limited the Commissioner than it has limited other administrative agencies.</text>

            <text syncTime="3957.005" offset="15828010">I think that he has to show therefore that these statutes on which he relies were clearly intended to limit the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.940" offset="15859670">So let's go first to Section 7605 (b) and that's on -- set forth on page 27 of the Government's brief in Powell and it's also in the last page of petitioner's brief here on the Ryan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.170" offset="15920588">And I think it's important enough and short enough to be worth reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.064" offset="15940232">It says no (Inaudible) -- it starts out, “Restrictions on examination of taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.291" offset="15957159">No taxpayer shall be subjected to unnecessary examination or investigations and only one inspection of the taxpayer's books of account shall be made for each taxable year, unless the taxpayer request otherwise or unless the secretary or his delegate parenthetically the Regional Commissioner after investigation notifies the taxpayer in writing that an additional inspection is necessary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.466" offset="16057783">Now the taxpayer reads this section as having two separate provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.871" offset="16083383">One is that an examination can't be unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.904" offset="16103549">The second there can't be a second investigation except for under certain conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.711" offset="16130821">Now the second part of the statute merely doesn't apply to him at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.921" offset="16155585">There hasn't been a second inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.779" offset="16163109">Therefore what he is arguing is that the provision about investigations not being unnecessary incorporates the standard of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.970" offset="16199784">Now our first argument is that there are -- there is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.455" offset="16213786">This section can not be divided into two pieces.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.011" offset="16227997">Now looking just in its language I think you could reasonably argue either way.</text>

            <text syncTime="4383.681" offset="17534642">I may say that the cases that -- I may say the cases that do deal with the earlier statutes are cited in the Powell -- in our reply brief in Powell and in the respondent's brief in Powell, In re Keagan, Brooklyn Pawn Brokers, the Andrews case, and I -- and they discussed the statue of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="4890.050" offset="19560176">Yes, during the trial we were Your Honor, because the Court believed that all the agent need to do is to show that he was making an examination for these years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.138" offset="19608451">And therefore, everything was relevant and material to that examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.858" offset="19631334">And he said fraud or no fraud irrespective of that that we must show.</text>
            <text syncTime="4912.898" offset="19651500">He said that we must show that the agent was wrongful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.982" offset="19667905">However, we didn't have the opportunity to present evidence because he felt that the agent, as he in his words said, an agent has the right to stop the first person that he sees on the street and demand and get his books and records.</text>

            <text syncTime="4932.668" offset="19730599">Well, now the Court of Appeals didn't agree with that though.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.628" offset="19738436">The Court of Appeals said, “This is not to say that the Court is without power to determine whether the investigation is being made in good faith.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4945.094" offset="19780336">And are you -- I want to know if you're suggesting here that you are making a claim that this investigation was not being made in good faith and that you were prevented from pursuing that claim in the District Court?</text>

            <text syncTime="4957.151" offset="19828506">That is one of our positions, it's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.209" offset="19840836">Although we haven't developed that as much as we could've if we'd had more evidence to show further bad faith, and then pointing it out here the fact that the agent had said in his complaint that all of the books and records existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.865" offset="19903425">And during the trial, a very meager colleague we had he said that he did not -- he had not asked the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.570" offset="19934250">I -- perhaps I'm missing the -- we do not feel that we had a reasonable hearing on the basis that the Court believed that all the agent had to do is ask for the books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="5000.285" offset="20001123">Thank Your Honor.</text>
