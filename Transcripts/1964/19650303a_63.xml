            <text syncTime="29.234" offset="116924">This case is an income tax case and it is I think one of very special importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.459" offset="141793">It involves a form of transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.085" offset="152242">It has become standardized, has been widely exploited and widely publicized.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.057" offset="176170">Under which the stockholders are closely held corporation, transfer the stock to a tax exempt charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.158" offset="212532">On the charity's promise to remit to them all the earnings of the business until they have received a -- some prescribed amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.625" offset="250462">The question is whether the earnings remitted to the stockholders are taxable then as ordinary income or as capital gain that is as gain from sale or exchange of the capital assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.368" offset="313469">The respondent's contend that such transaction is a sale and that the earnings remitted to them -- to the stockholders are simply payments of a purchased price and thus, amounts realized from a sale taxable as capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.110" offset="372402">We contend that what the stockholders have is simply a right to the future income which when received must be taxed to them as income.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.255" offset="417019">Basically in our view, the transaction is simply a gift of a remainder in busi -- in a business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.403" offset="4153574">Now, I've leased the building for the four remaining term of the ground lease and an annual net rent in excess to the ground rent of $21,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.160" offset="4188578">When the lease has 20 years to go, I purport to sell my leasehold interest to be my son or a stranger for $400,000, he gives me a note, it's called a promissory note.</text>

            <text syncTime="1071.127" offset="4284500">However we add, his liability is limited to remitting that out of the rents received from the property and if I don't get it, all I can do is give back the leasehold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.160" offset="4340611">Now, let me just point out what happens if you say that transaction is a sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.648" offset="4438518">In principle, he would have income of $21,000 a year from the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.750" offset="4458998">But he has a $20,000 offsetting amortization deduction and in fact, his taxed only under $1000, I let him keep as his fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.543" offset="4506122">This case doesn't have a thing to do with abuse of charitable exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.232" offset="4524826">You can work this transaction out with -- sometimes as equal benefits, if you have fully depreciable property, with lesser benefits if it's an interfamily shift of income to different brackets.</text>

            <text syncTime="1196.988" offset="4787931">After the transaction, the business did go on and the amounts paid by Fortuna as rent for the Institute were remitted to respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.815" offset="4819174">During the years 1953 to 1956, they received amounts totaling $651,000 and the question here is the treatment of those amounts, if the amounts received in the later years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.635" offset="4882495">Now in economic term, but first I like to analyze the transaction in economic terms without any -- necessarily implying any tax consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.419" offset="4925649">The crucial thing about the transaction is that the Institutes neither pay nor risk a single dollar of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.063" offset="4968176">It made no down payment out of its own funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1251.165" offset="5004643">All it agreed to do and this is all it agreed to do was to remit to the respondent 90% of the income earned by the lease of the assets to Fortuna.</text>

            <text syncTime="1818.608" offset="7274371">Let me turn to tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.382" offset="7285447">The statute is very simple, the relevant provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.880" offset="7299448">They're very general.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.147" offset="7304568">Gain is gain from -- capital gain is gained from the sale or exchange of a capital asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.131" offset="7336438">Gain is measured by the amount realized from the sale or exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.132" offset="7356500">The amount realized is this amount of money received plus the fair market value of property other than money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.130" offset="7396519">Now to illustrate the application of those provisions in very simple terms, I'd like several -- a few simple examples of -- let's take -- the gift of -- the transfer of -- A transfers stock to B on B's agreement to remit income for his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.989" offset="7463915">Now what -- I told you, everyone who agrees that isn't, that's still income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.368" offset="7477394">Why isn't it capital gain?</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.617" offset="7490456">My transactions -- a transfer of stock on the transferee's agreement to remit the dividends either for life, for a term or up to stated amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.365" offset="7525460">And I think it is agreed that is not -- the dividends remitted will be taxable as ordinary inome and not as capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.234" offset="7552836">Now, there are basically two reasons why that isn't capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.510" offset="7569972">The first is that since my right to income is a right in the very same property I transferred, it's only a retained right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.471" offset="7601842">I may have disposed the remainder but what I have is just a carved out interest on the very thing I had before and it's not even a taxable exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.706" offset="7630785">I didn't receive it in exchange for something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.043" offset="7640085">I just kept it and so there's no sale or exchange in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.287" offset="7657117">But the second reason is much more fundamental and that is what I have is a right to income.</text>

            <text syncTime="1934.930" offset="7739664">Suppose that I own some General Motors stock permit which I bought for $20,000 and it's now worth $30,000 and I want to dispose it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1975.679" offset="7902668">However, during my life, Ford does very well and I receive total distributions of a $100,000 or $200,000 from that trust (Inaudible) -- interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.188" offset="7944673">Now, the fact -- there is a taxable exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.101" offset="7960346">The exchange of my General Motor stock for a life and estate in Ford stock is a taxable exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.360" offset="7985424">But the amount realized is the value of the interest I received, the value of the life estate and that value is $30,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="2695.422" offset="10781675">Back in 1953 in behalf of our firm, I wrote an opinion that told Mr. Brown that he was entitled to capital gain if he went into this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.988" offset="10835905">Today, I would not write an opinion saying that the tax consequences flowed in the manner that Mr. Barnett has stated in some of the illustrations he used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.897" offset="10879582">But I won't show the flaws in them because I'm not sure that the -- particularly pertinent, I'd rather proceed with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.085" offset="10956278">It is true that a transaction of this type is subject to abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.021" offset="10992013">It is also true that the standard of the plan for a corporate buyout that I outlined in my brief, where a person forms a thinly capitalized corporation and buys the stock of another corporation liquidates it in that that too is subject to abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.006" offset="11087935">In either case, the purchaser could assume the role of a complete patsy and say, "Since I'm risking nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.170" offset="11124611">Since there's no skin off my nose, I don't care what the purchase price is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.365" offset="11149375">The agreements I have here have the price left blank, you fill it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.500" offset="11169959">You just see that I get something as we go along such as 10% or a little salary and I won't care".</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.518" offset="11202038">Such a situation, such a sale would be bad and it would not be entitled to capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.333" offset="11233280">Now, the factors that make it subject to abuse are the lack of down payment, the lack of personal liability or the lack a commitment of independent assets but whatever the fact that it may be subject to abuse does not mean that every case where you have these lacks is abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.273" offset="11328993">Also, this transaction does not fit in with may be which we would call the traditional or standard mold of commercial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.595" offset="11370371">However, the capital gain provision does not say sale or exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.224" offset="11392836">In ordinary commercial transactions, it says, “Sales or exchanges”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.020" offset="11412062">In the definition of a capital asset, it excludes from the definition property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3270.223" offset="13080869">But if it survives that scrutiny, then the mere fact that it might have been abused but wasn't abused doesn't disvalue -- disqualify it for capital gain.</text>

            <text syncTime="3289.673" offset="13158609">I'd like to say a few words about the Tax Court trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.624" offset="13178462">This wasn't a case that got through the local office in Portland without the Government being aware of its significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.259" offset="13208973">They were aware that this was the first case, the forerunner case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.890" offset="13227468">We purposely wanted to be the first case because I didn't know when I wrote the opinion back in 1953 that this was a widely publicized tax avoidance scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.744" offset="13270936">So, law review articles hadn't been written in, that revenue ruling hadn't been issued at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.783" offset="13303118">So, we had taken a couple of features out that were present in it, one being, the Institute's invitation that Mr. Brown own 49% of the lessee company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.211" offset="13364767">We couldn't see how that had any relationship to just a security device.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.904" offset="13387546">Also, that you -- they said you can have a management contract, an employment contract until you're ready to retire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.356" offset="13417326">We couldn't see how that had anything to do with the security device.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.133" offset="13436447">So Mr. Brown did not own anything in the lessee corporation and his management contract is extended only until the purchase price was paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.583" offset="13490260">Now, I'm not sure that those two will make it bad if it's otherwise good.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.475" offset="13509799">It's just, we didn't want to come through (Inaudible) -- mudded waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.852" offset="13527353">And also, our price was right and we got the inference, maybe it was the wrong inference because all of the cases decided since then have been favorable to the taxpayers that perhaps there is a backlog of cases where they have unrealistic purchase prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.945" offset="13603736">Well, ours wasn't and we were willing to subject it to the scrutiny of the Tax Court and we did and as I say, our tom tom there was the price is right and no strings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.718" offset="13650860">So maybe it is a little bit of an offbeat transaction but still we're entitled to capital gain because there's nothing that says that the purchaser has to contribute something to a deal for capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.889" offset="13707494">It's what the seller gives up.</text>

            <text syncTime="3817.979" offset="15271915">I was relating something about the Tax Court trial with the thought in the mind that this would be of interest to negate some of the inferences that may have been raised by Mr. Barnett's brief in his oral argument that our approach there is the same here that if the price is right and there are no strings, we're entitled to capital gain treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.550" offset="15390198">The Commissioner's main contention at -- in the Tax Court was that there was a secret understanding, a tacit agreement that the Institute was never really to end up with the assets but that Clay Brown could get them back anytime he wanted so he could generate this capital gain and also not have to give up the assets and the Institute would get its 10% so it would be happy with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.869" offset="15519451">Of course, we recognize that they were correct in that statement, that we were entitled to capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.636" offset="15550485">That was quite a potent accusation they made which meant that we put everything on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.533" offset="15582041">That's why the record was so complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.226" offset="15592803">Now on appeal, I get a little bit of the inference that because the record is so voluminous, therefore, it must have been kind of an offbeat transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.614" offset="15630420">And the reason the record was so voluminous is because of that contention made by the Commissioner at the Tax Court trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.291" offset="15661140">The Tax Court held against that contention and the Commissioner abandoned it on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.633" offset="15686531">The Commissioner also contended that Clay Brown retained too much control over the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.789" offset="15723102">There wasn't much contention that the purchase was too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.787" offset="15739089">That was an attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.812" offset="15743164">There wasn't any statement saying, “Well, no one on the right mind would make this sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.369" offset="15761450">You must have had an unusually high purchase price because the witnesses were there".</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.468" offset="15773780">They could have asked them that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.971" offset="15787781">We put on Clay Brown and we put on Bill Booth who was his treasurer who took care of that compiling the figures and showing the earning at the record and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="3961.329" offset="15845251">We tendered them all on cross-examination so they could have the omplete leeway of cross-examination to ask any questions they wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.807" offset="15879210">Also, the Institute, I mean the Commissioner subpoenaed and brought up for Los Angeles the President of the Institute, Mr. (Inaudible) and Mr. Seagrave who negotiated the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.741" offset="15934903">However, the Commissioner did not call them and would not have called them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.393" offset="15949531">I had to call them as our witness so they had them on cross-examination to ask whatever questions they want.</text>

            <text syncTime="4560.580" offset="18242247">I think they had a fiduciary duty to run the business so that there'd be a payoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="4566.328" offset="18265234">But the main way I answered that which I recognized as being the most difficult point in the whole thing was to analogize it to other situations where capital gain is realized, particularly in a Section 1239 situation, where a person owns depreciable property and he sells it to a corporation in which he owns 80% of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.968" offset="18363768">There, capital gain is expressly condoned by the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="4939.681" offset="19758707">And I'm sure that the Secretary of the Treasury here wasn't just giving to Congress an example of an idiotic situation no in their right mind would enter into.</text>
            <text syncTime="4952.600" offset="19810325">I think he was giving a very real situation and you'll notice that the Secretary of the Treasury said that under present law, capital gain treatment would be accorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4966.624" offset="19866436">He didn't say capital gain treatment might be accorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.494" offset="19877930">He said it would be accorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.774" offset="19883050">His only qualification was whether you get your basis recovery right of or whether you have to take your basis recovery pro rata.</text>
            <text syncTime="4978.671" offset="19914606">And that is an important part they made in the brief that I won't to elaborate on too much in argument that that plus, Section 4 of the Interest Imputation Section, Section 483 that the Commissioner went out to Capitol Hill and try to get Congress to adopt this view point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5000.439" offset="20001750">Congress knowingly said, “No, we don't want it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.152" offset="20016588">But they didn't leave at all tax as ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.334" offset="20029336">They said we're going to impute interest because we didn't have interest in our -- the $1,300,000 was payable without interest and one of the alternative contentions made by the Commissioner was that you have an interest factor in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.250" offset="20088999">The Tax Court held against them on that and the commissioner abandoned that upon appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5028.192" offset="20112718">And as we have stated in our brief, if it takes an act of Congress to reverse an alternative contention of the Commissioner, why should they take an act of Congress to do as main contention, particularly when its main contention is set forth in a question in an example presented to Congress where he says unequivocally, you get capital gain in a situation like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5050.924" offset="20203624">Also, I cite that example for the proposition that situations like this are normal that people do enter into them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5061.961" offset="20247824">Otherwise, the Secretary of the Treasurer wouldn't have given this example and I'm certainly sure that you don't presuppose in this example that the purchase price was adjust purchased price from $350,000 was an exorbitant price.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.903" offset="20307592">I think it's a reasonable price.</text>
            <text syncTime="5078.916" offset="20315638">But I think we can see from this example why a purchaser adds something and contribute something to the deal even though there's no injection on new capital, no down payment or no personal liability and that's because of the increased cash flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.896" offset="20375510">Because all we have to do in this example is superimpose a few facts and I think it comes out fairly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5100.554" offset="20402155">It says that M -- that S had a basis of 75,000 for a stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="5106.690" offset="20426710">That means, they only paid 75,000 into the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.796" offset="20443115">So, the corporation made profits and bought machinery but let's say that it's also depreciated its machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.810" offset="20471223">Let's say its machinery has depreciated down to $50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.327" offset="20493270">Now, the purchaser who comes along and pays $350,000 for that business gets added depreciation of $300,000, added depreciation of $300,000 at a 50% rate is a $150,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="5138.898" offset="20555546">A $150,000 of additional cash flow, of additional available dollars that a purchasing company gets irrespective and independent from any initial injection of capital or any personal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.511" offset="20629943">Actually, a person who is selling a small corporation has to sell on the deferred payment basis because there aren't too many people around with that much cash and if they have that much cash, they don't want to put it on one deal so selling on the deferred payment basis is the norm.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.163" offset="20696607">So the question is, how much beefing up can you get.</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.280" offset="20713117">In every purchaser likes to get away with this little as possible, he likes to commit as little of its assets as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.121" offset="20740389">And usually the reason that you want some beefing up is not so much that that is going to give you a cushion because how much -- cause if things go bad even if $50,000 cushion isn't really going to be adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5199.914" offset="20799634">The main reason for the cushion is to make the purchaser hurdle a little so that he's sure that he gives it a college try.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.791" offset="20827115">But here, we didn't have to have that because Clay Brown was managing it and he knew it would be given a college try because he was the one expending the effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="5216.815" offset="20867239">But that's what makes these things go under the standard plan that you get this additional cash flow by virtue of this depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5226.522" offset="20906005">But may be that's a bygone era and that's another thing and I think the Commissioner is already won the day but not in this Court but by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5235.101" offset="20940382">Because under Section 1245 that adds back your depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.978" offset="20963892">Any depreciation taken since January 1, 1962 is taxed as ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="5245.895" offset="20983536">So, if you got to step up to $300,000 from depreciation I mention and all that depreciation were taken since January 1, 1962 it would be taxed as ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.854" offset="21031393">All the beauty is gone from the transaction and you probably wouldn't do it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.694" offset="21058769">So, this maybe is a passing era, this of the standard plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.440" offset="21077682">But it wasn't a bygone era at the time this transaction was entered into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.853" offset="21099311">And all that this formula with the Institute was simply a different means of generating cash flow.</text>

            <text syncTime="5464.735" offset="21858847">Its tax to the distributing corporation like when Clay Brown was liquidated into the Institute, Clay Brown is the distributing corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.476" offset="21889881">Its not tax exempt, you see.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.674" offset="21898658">So the Institute's exemption does not immunize the 1245 pick up.</text>

            <text syncTime="5503.591" offset="22014328">If the standard plan approach is dead, the Institute -- formula approach is just as dead because this hit just as hard as is this standard plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5517.849" offset="22071380">So, whenever they do that Section 1245 in the impute interest and not only that but Commissioner goes to Capitol Hill and gives a hypothetical like this which adopts -- practically what Mr. Barnett was saying and Congress says, "No".</text>
            <text syncTime="5537.169" offset="22148598">I think you have a pretty good expression of congressional intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="5577.069" offset="22308258">When you're dealing with taxation, I like to start with the Code provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5583.412" offset="22333544">And there is one spot in Mr. Barnett's brief where he mentions the Code provisions, both in the same paragraph which is the only place that he mentions on both on the same paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="5601.938" offset="22407732">And that's on page 15 and 16 at his brief where he says, “If in a realizing event, a transferor receives a right to income in exchange for a couple assets the only amount realized from the exchange itself and hence the amount taxed as well as capital gain is the value of the right to the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.580" offset="22486309">The income may after produced by that right remains fully taxable.</text>

            <text syncTime="5676.989" offset="22707931">We're not ascribing any other attributes to the capital gain provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5681.535" offset="22726113">When what is received may exchange for a capital asset is its self right to income.</text>
            <text syncTime="5686.527" offset="22746070">The only possible way in which the gain can be separated from the future income is by valuing the right to the future payment and treating its value as the amount realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.951" offset="22783791">Well, applying that to the facts of our situation, the realizing event was the transfer of the Clay Brown and company stock to the Institute in return for the right to receive a million three.</text>
            <text syncTime="5708.488" offset="22833946">Now that million three was represented by a note, but the note was non-negotiable and incorporated the agreement by reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5714.578" offset="22858292">So I don't have ascribe any particular significance, the factors, I know it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5717.560" offset="22870204">I'm willing to say, it was just a contractual right to receive a million three.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.319" offset="22889221">So, alright, we'll let our capital gain be determined by the value of that right on February 4, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="5729.820" offset="22919210">What was the value of that right?</text>
            <text syncTime="5732.068" offset="22928196">We think it was a million three or it was the same as the value of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="5736.130" offset="22944496">And all he has done is taking the reverse side or back door approach to point one of our initial thesis that your only entitled to capital gain in the extent that the stock was worth a million three on February 4, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="5752.755" offset="23010952">It's the same criteria go into determining what's the value of the right to receive the million three as go into the determining what's the value of the stock.</text>

            <text syncTime="5801.676" offset="23206661">But I think actually you can find a value easier in the right to receive the million three than you can in valuing the stock because here, there is a finding that the Commissioner agreed to because its I meant to mention in discussing what the Tax Court said that the Commissioner excepts in the Circuit Court all of the basic findings of the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5825.641" offset="23302478">One of those findings was that the Institute expect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5828.936" offset="23315644">And I think the Institute would include Clay Brown because he furnished the figures expected that the purchase price would be paid in five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5837.605" offset="23350335">The note wasn't due till -- for 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5840.121" offset="23360470">So, he had a 100% leeway there reduced between 5 years and 10 years to expect to be in -- paid in 5 years be pretty hard to say that a note secured by this underlying assets and so forth was worth anything less than a million three.</text>
            <text syncTime="5853.884" offset="23415536">So, let our capital gain be determined by the million three.</text>
            <text syncTime="5857.565" offset="23430165">But then where we part company is -- I'm not sure we part the company, it's how then he gets the receipts on a tax as ordinary income because under the installment method, you're entitled to report on the installment method.</text>
            <text syncTime="5872.639" offset="23490456">And the installment provision does not apply just to sales even if these weren't a sale it applies to sales in any other dispositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5880.516" offset="23522011">The installment method does not require any indebtedness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5885.221" offset="23540820">All it requires is the right to receive income.</text>
            <text syncTime="5889.446" offset="23557747">The only mention of indebtedness is it says, “You can't receive more than 30% of the purchase price during the year sale and in determining the 30% you exclude evidences of indebtedness of the purchaser.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5902.369" offset="23609469">But evidence of indebtedness of the purchaser are only something you exclude to keep from getting knocked out of the coverage of the provision, it's not that we requisite for coming under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5913.587" offset="23654296">So if we have a -- the right to receive the million three, is worth a million three in February 4, 1953 we don't have to take it into income and figure out some way to get it back through amortization or depreciation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5927.934" offset="23711660">We rely on the installment provision or even if you didn't have to get it back, you could amortize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5934.032" offset="23736111">Because if I paid a million three for a non-negotiable promissory note for a million three, I certainly would get to set off my purchase price for it as I received it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5947.457" offset="23789819">Now, he tries to relate it back got, you got to get it related to the underlying assets some weight but that isn't necessary at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5956.897" offset="23827540">In other words, you can go right down with them on the approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="5959.745" offset="23838929">I think our approach is better.</text>
            <text syncTime="5961.213" offset="23844780">I think in the front door, a conversion of capital investment, what was the stock worth at the time is a little more better approach than taking the other end of it that the --what was the right to income that you receive, what was that worth?</text>
            <text syncTime="5977.858" offset="23911340">But either way, you end up on the same spot and the only place he goes astray -- and I think what he says is, “You not only got to take the million three in as capital gain but also you should receive payments on the million three.</text>
            <text syncTime="5991.466" offset="23965780">You got to take that in as ordinary income where there's just no foundation for that in the tax flow whatsoever".</text>
            <text syncTime="5997.991" offset="23991902">Then say, "Even if it wasn't for the installment sale provision, you have the equivalent of cash doctrine for a cash basis taxpayer which these were and while the right to receive the million three maybe worth a million three for determining capital gain purposes it's not for the purpose of reporting income because it's been established that if you have the obligation to General Motors to receive a million three, a cash basis taxpayer doesn't have to take all of that in.</text>
            <text syncTime="6025.576" offset="24102243">He just takes it as he receives it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6027.907" offset="24111543">He only has to take it all in if he receives the equivalent of cash such as a promissory note.</text>
            <text syncTime="6033.447" offset="24133695">But as I say we don't have to rely on that doctrine because we did elect the installment method.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.091" offset="24152294">The Tax Court found we elected the installment method and that was one of the basic findings that the Commissioner accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6044.637" offset="24178521">So we can even go right down with them in the law.</text>
