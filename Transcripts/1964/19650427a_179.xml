            <label>Mr. Robert R. Eidsmoe</label>
            <text syncTime="53.138" offset="212532">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.156" offset="224549">This is an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of the State of Iowa pursuant to 28 U.S.C., Section 1257(2).</text>
            <text syncTime="65.896" offset="263523">The question presented here is rather narrowly defined and is whether or not the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the United States and Greece nullifies the requirement of Section 567.8 of the Court of Iowa that the appellant here, a non-resident Greek alien, proved the existence of a reciprocal right to succession before he can acquire interest in Iowa property by succession from his adopting father.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.928" offset="387657">Briefly, the facts in this case are that back in 1950 or 1946, the appellee here, then a young lady of approximately 18 years married one Nicholas Stergios, then approximately 54 years of age and in 1954, Nicholas Stergios executed a will wherein he left the bulk of his property to his wife and some other property to what is indicated to be a niece ward.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.467" offset="517851">No mention was made in that will of any provision for children or any mention made with regard to children at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.289" offset="553064">No children were born of this marriage between the appellee and Nicholas Stergios and then in 1956 and 1957, discussion was had between the married couple about the desirability of adopting a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.483" offset="613878">Proceedings were commenced in a Court in Greece to adopt the young child there, which culminated in a decree in a Greek Court in February 1958 whereby the appellant's ward here was adopted by Nicholas Stergios.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.196" offset="684722">Nick Stergios became ill shortly after the adoption decree and died in August 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.115" offset="712411">The minor child was never brought over to this country, Mr. Stergios’ estate was probated and closed in March 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.462" offset="749819">Early in 1961, this guardianship wherein Stanley Corbett became the guardian of Constantine Neonakis was established and a suit was commenced in the District Court of Iowa in Woodbury County to reopen the estate, set aside the probate proceedings, have a new administrator appointed, and to have -- to allow the child to recover two-thirds of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.009" offset="843964">Under Iowa law an after-born child who is not mentioned in a will is entitled to recover a child’s intestate share, which in Iowa is two-thirds of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.803" offset="891193">The trial was had in July of 1962 wherein the appellant contended that the child had been legally and validly adopted in the Greek Courts and that by virtue of Section 633.13 of the Court of Iowa the child was entitled to a child's intestate share.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.772" offset="979069">In the proceedings in the Iowa Court, there came at a question then whether or not the child was entitled to inherit, because of the provisions of Iowa Code Section 567.8, which states that a non-resident alien cannot take title to real estate in Iowa, unless he can prove the existence of reciprocal rights to succession granted to American citizens in his country.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.210" offset="1076767">Or in other words here, the Greek alien could not inherit Iowa property unless he could prove that American citizens in Greece were granted a reciprocal right to inherit property in Greece from Greeks.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.028" offset="1140088">The Iowa Code Section applies to both real property and personal property Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.862" offset="1167360">It was contended by the appellant at the time of the trial and the Court took judicial notice of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between United States and Greece and as I say, it was contended by the appellant that the provisions of this treaty nullified the requirements of the Iowa Code Section requiring proof of reciprocal inheritance rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.922" offset="1251683">The Trial Court found that there had been a valid adoption in the Greek Courts by Nick Stergios and that the adoption was conclusive on the Iowa Court and that there had been no fraud in the procurement of the adoption.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="326.113" stopTime="326.727">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="326.113" offset="1304451">There had been what?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_r_eidsmoe" startTime="326.727" stopTime="579.667">
            <label>Mr. Robert R. Eidsmoe</label>
            <text syncTime="326.727" offset="1306854">No fraud in the procurement of the adoption, that had been one ground raised by the defendant there.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.198" offset="1336738">The Iowa Court did find however that there was no conflict between the provisions of the Iowa reciprocal succession statute and the treaty and thereupon dismissed the petition of the appellant herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.822" offset="1395252">Appeal was taken to the Iowa Supreme Court and there the sole question raised on appeal was the claimed error of the trial court in holding that there was no conflict between the treaty and the statute and again, this time by a five to four decision, the Iowa Supreme Court held that again there was no conflict between the treaty and the statute and held that the Trial Court was correct in dismissing the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.813" offset="1511236">So hence, we're in this Court, appealing a decision of the Iowa Supreme Court and we get down to the basic issue in the case whether the treaty suspends or nullifies, whichever term you prefer, the requirements of Section 567.8 of the Iowa Code that the appellant must prove the existence of reciprocal succession rights in order to enable him to take property by succession.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.943" offset="1607680">We get down to a few basic principles of interpretation of treaty, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.875" offset="1631399">The first, of course that the treaties -- treaty power is supreme, treaties are to be liberally construed, and that there is no need to restrictively interpret treaties in order to avoid any conflicts with state statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.109" offset="1696392">Now without regard to the treaty for a moment, there is no question but that Section 567.8 of Iowa code would require the appellant here to prove the existence of reciprocal succession rights, in other words, that American citizens could inherit in Greece to the same extent that we're claiming rights in the Iowa Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.077" offset="1792209">This is without regard of the treaty, and the burden is placed upon the appellant and/or the plaintiff, the claimant, to make such proof as a matter of fact of the Greek law.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.899" offset="1843513">This, we did not do, but chose to rely upon the provisions of the treaty, which we felt to be completely in conflict with the Iowa statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.335" offset="1885309">Now, the treaty and the pertinent part of the treaty is Article IX and first of all, Section 1 of Article IX provides that nationals of the United States and Greece are given national treatment within the territory of the other to acquire land and other immovable property subject to certain limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.281" offset="1969110">Now, the first limitation applies to Greek Nationals claiming property in the United States and Section 8 says, in case of Greek Nationals, the acquisition of property rights is dependent upon state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.365" offset="2029401">In regard to U.S. Nationals claiming rights in Greece, the right to acquire is subject to restrictions, which Greece may place upon aliens in certain frontier and coastal areas, which I suppose is for the purposes of National Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.347" offset="2093349">Now so far, I don't believe that the appellant and appellee have any disagreement as to the meanings of the treaty down to this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.434" offset="2129711">And I don't believe there's any doubt that if this is all the treaty said, we would have to prove the existence of the reciprocal succession rights and we did not do so and the Trial Court would have been correct in dismissing the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.172" offset="2188643">However, all important we feel is the provision set out in the next article of the treaty, which is Article II.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.883" offset="2223438">And Article II provides in essence where the alienage of a national of either party prevents him from receiving national treatment in acquiring property in the territory of the other by succession, he shall be allowed to freely dispose of the property within a period of 5 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.577" offset="2286237">Now, I haven't quoted it exactly, because it is stated a little bit differently in that, but in essence this is what the section provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.163" offset="2316643">And so --</text>

            <text syncTime="649.145" offset="2596571">Of course, we claim the right to dispose comes by virtue of the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.510" offset="2621962">We think that appellant contends that Section 1 and Section 2 of Article IX of the treaty, setup a definite pattern that is to be followed and a definite intent on the part of the drafters of the treaty that it was recognized that States have placed certain restrictions upon the rights of aliens to acquire property within their borders and that this is partly due to the fact that States have always zealously guarded their right to determine who ultimately holds title to real estate within their borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.876" offset="2759471">On the other hand, you have the conflicting legal principle that the treaty right is supreme and the Federal Government must protect its treaty power.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.143" offset="2784549">And so, we feel that the plain meaning of the Article IX of the treaty is that states -- while states may restrict the right of Greek Nationals to acquire real property rights and personal property rights in their state that the right of Greek aliens should not be completely cut off and they should be allowed a period of time in which to sell the property, receive the market value of it, and withdraw the proceeds, thus, striking a balance between the right estates to ultimately determine who is to hold title in their property and prevent a forfeiture of an inheritance on the part of the aliens.</text>

            <text syncTime="784.726" offset="3138873">In other words, these words have to do with the right to dispose of property.</text>

            <text syncTime="794.994" offset="3179938">This of course is correct and this is the reasoning for Trial Court applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.466" offset="3201776">It felt that the Section 2 here of Article IX only dealt with the disposal of property and didn't' deal with the acquisition of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.436" offset="3233646">However, I think that the plain meaning of Section 2 here says that, it specifically states nationals and companies of either parities shall be permitted free to dispose of property for their alienage has prevented them from receiving national treatment in the acquisition of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.862" offset="3299370">Now I believe there isn't anything to dispose, if you don't acquire something in the first place, and I believe this point has been very clearly covered by this Court in the case of Clark versus Allen, interpreting a very similar treaty between United States and Germany as applied to a California statute, which I'm sure Iowa has frankly copied verbatim from, and it held and the Iowa Courts that have held with reference to previous treaties as well, other treaties that where you have this power of sale granted in a treaty this in itself constitutes the grant of a property right and that unless there is some right granted there is nothing to sell at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.663" offset="3470629">And the Iowa Courts and I believe this Court has described this right as either a determinable fee or a limited fee of some type, they say it doesn't make much difference what you actually call it, but the actual grant of the right to sell covers with it property rights so that it can be disposed of within the period of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="920.906" offset="3683579">However, I think that if this meaning was given to this provision, it would very narrowly limit the number of persons who would ever be entitled to ever acquire any rights under it and I don't believe that that would be the intent of the whole meaning of the Article as read as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.477" offset="3749825">We think that – I think that it plainly means that states do have the right to grant certain or to give certain limits to the right to acquire, but where they do so, where they discriminate against aliens and aliens because of their alienage are not given national treatment, they shall be given the right to dispose.</text>

            <text syncTime="994.936" offset="3979703">This is our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.241" offset="3984927">We can see that if we must -- if we intend to take a fee simple or absolute to this property that we must have proven the existence of reciprocal successions rights, but not having done this, we're entitled to at least the limited fee and the right to sell the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.081" offset="4072281">As I have previously stated, we think that this case clearly comes within the scope of the case of Clark versus Allen and, which was decided by this Court back in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.109" offset="4120346">The California statute is absolutely undistinguishable from the Iowa statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.193" offset="4144692">The provision of the treaty between the United States and Germany with regard to real property, it cannot be distinguished and this Court held at that time, that the California law or requirement, requiring a German alien to prove the existence of reciprocal succession rights under the California statute was in conflict with the treaty and there was no need to prove the existence of reciprocal succession rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.856" offset="4259422">Now, we find that it's quite difficult to understand the reasoning of the Iowa Court in the way it got at the fact that there is still the necessity of proving the existence of reciprocal succession rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.468" offset="4313861">One way they did get at, was that, they claimed that Article XXIV and specifically Section 1 to some extent nullified and suspended the provisions of Section 2 of Article IX upon which we rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.911" offset="4379585">And of course, Article XXIV, Section 1 simply defines the meaning of the term “National Treatment”, and the Iowa Court quoted the last sentence of Section 1 of Article XXIV and it stated, “the term does not imply immunity from the laws and regulations of a party, which apply in a nondiscriminatory manner to Nationals Company's products, vessels of both parties,” but it left out the portion of this sentence, which says, which apply in a nondiscriminatory manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.135" offset="4504451">And the Iowa Court said that, well if National Treatment doesn't mean that the parties in particular here in this case Greeks are freed from State Laws or that the Section 567.8 must apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.486" offset="4573936">However, what the Court overlooked and left out of its quotation of this sentence was the term, which apply in a nondiscriminatory manner and of course, it's our contention that Section 567.8 of the Iowa Code is clearly discriminatory against the aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.595" offset="4630361">It's only aliens who have to prove the existence of reciprocal succession rights and it's because of their alienage that in this case an added burden was placed upon us, which we could or could not have met, but which has prevented us from acquiring title to the property and two-thirds of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.805" offset="4699220">So while regulations and laws maybe passed by a state in the manner in which persons acquire property within their borders and national treatment contemplates this, where you have a state statute that applies in a discriminatory manner and prevents an alien, because of his alienage from acquiring property rights in the state Section 2 of Article IX comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.588" offset="4798276">We contend that in this case we have not been allowed to acquire and receive that -- we have not been allowed to receive property, because of our alienage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.363" offset="4837355">By reason of our alienage, we have not been able to receive National Treatment and so, under the provisions of Section 2, we should be allowed a provision or a period of 5 years to dispose of the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1234.645" offset="4938501">It says property and I would assume that property could include both the term of real property and personal property, although, I will concede that Section 1 describes only interests in real estate and immovable property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.614" offset="5002449">This is largely a moot point in this case, because the personal property involved is of infinitesimal amount involving I believe a 1948 Pontiac automobile, but I think that the treaty could include real estate and personal property as well and this is the view of the Acting Deputy Attorney for the State Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.265" offset="5100983">We believe here that on familiar principles to this Court, the interpretations placed upon treaties by the departments of the Government that are charged with their administration are highly important and are given great weight by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.676" offset="5154691">And I would call the Court's attention to the brief submitted by the Solicitor General at the request of this Court concerning this case and his views on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.797" offset="5195128">And particularly, at page 3 where Archibald Cox, the Solicitor General states, the Iowa Courts have held that state laws of inheritance maybe applied, so as to defeat the right of a nonresident Greek national to take by succession real and personal property located within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.822" offset="5267226">This holding depends upon a construction of the treaty between United States and Greece.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.278" offset="5285094">That construction in view of both the Department of State and the Greek Government is in error and after reviewing two or three opinions from other attorneys in the State Department, all conclude that by virtue of the treaty between United States and Greece, there is no burden on this appellant and by virtue of the Greek treaty to prove the existence of reciprocal succession rights to acquire property interests under Section 2 of Article IX of the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.107" offset="5400346">We believe that this view should be given great weight by the Court since the Court has recognized in a number of cases that the view of the State Department should be given great weight.</text>

            <text syncTime="1515.490" offset="6061871">Attorney for the appellant in this matter has very briefly and fairly succinctly given you the facts in this particular case, up to a point, he has stated that there was no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.020" offset="6120072">There is one though that I would like to call your attention to and this pertains to Article IX, Section 1, subsection B and this concerns the restrictions, which Greece itself may place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.737" offset="6186945">Now, there is a statement in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Iowa on this matter and there is also a statement that Counsel here made, which are similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.232" offset="6224875">He states that Greece may place restrictions on the use of certain property in coastal areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.866" offset="6251416">I think if you read it a little bit closer, the words will show that Greece may place restrictions on the acquisition of the property as well as on the use, lease, and occupancy in the coastal area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.480" offset="6353920">Now, it is the contention of the appellant in this matter that a reading of the treaty herein will support the position taken by the Supreme Court of Iowa and the District Court of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.608" offset="6426331">We realize that there are certain statements in the opinions of both courts, which may not support the position taken by the appellee herein, but we feel that reading the words of the friendship treaty that we are fully supported in our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.840" offset="6507311">Now, what did the friendship treaty with Greece provide?</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.372" offset="6521417">The important provision is Article IX.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.878" offset="6535419">Article IX provides for the acquisition of certain property by purchase or otherwise, otherwise we take that here is liberally construed by the State Department as well as by Counsel for the appellant to include inheritance rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.002" offset="6627997">Subsection A of Section 1 of Article IX provides that certain state laws will be applied or are applicable as far as national treatment is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.076" offset="6696229">It is our contention herein that the Iowa Code, Section 567.8 is applicable by the terms of this statute -- by the terms of this treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.845" offset="6755370">The appellant apparently agrees with this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.242" offset="6768953">However, I should call your attention to the position taken by the State Department in their letter in Appendix A, wherein they state that Article IX, Section 1 is subject to local laws, which may limit the rights of aliens to hold property and they underline the word hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.361" offset="6873443">However, we feel that this interpretation taken by the State Department, which would limit it simply to holding statutes is not in agreement with the plain meaning of the words, which state that local laws do apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.416" offset="6941571">I should further call your attention to this same letter by Abraham Chase in which he states under Article IX, subsection 2 that a limitation is placed upon this exception for the state laws prohibiting alien ownership of realty by requiring that an alien be allowed 5 years in which to dispose of real property he has acquired through inheritance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.685" offset="7054733">In other words, the position taken by the State Department in this matter would seem to conflict to us with the position taken by appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.799" offset="7095171">In other words, they are going on the position that Article IX, subsection 1 applies local laws as far as the holding of real property is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.841" offset="7147311">However, we feel that when you read Subsection B and read the restrictions that Greece is allowed to impose, restrictions on the acquisition and restrictions on the lease, use and occupancy in particular coastal areas that it goes much beyond just a holding statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.857" offset="7239367">Now, we've also taken the position that Section 2 when read with Section 1 is simply an application or an extension of the period of time which property maybe held that the state law, holds that it will be held for a period of less than three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.033" offset="7340095">Now, we go back to the Preamble of this treaty, which states that it is a Treaty of Friendship and that it's going to be founded on principles of most favored nation treatment unconditionally accorded and national treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.090" offset="7408327">Now, we state that if national treatment is to mean anything, then the important section is Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.390" offset="7449496">If we read Section 2 as is contended by the appellants in this matter, then Section 1 becomes almost meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.822" offset="7483246">In other words, you can do almost anything you want to under Section 2 and Section 1, it really doesn't matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.176" offset="7512607">Now, they've said specifically that it applies to -- Section 1 applies to fee simple interest, we think that it applies to all interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.100" offset="7552313">In other words, as long as reciprocity is shown, any interest that the individual might have or might acquire is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.390" offset="7597558">Under subsection 2 however, if the interest under the law is for a period of less than 3 years and the state law provides for a disposition within that period, then the person claiming is given a longer period of time in order to dispose of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.275" offset="7693061">We think that, that is all that particular section means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.095" offset="7764323">The appellants have made much of the fact that under their interpretation of the law it isn't necessary to prove reciprocity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.765" offset="7818971">In other words, the only thing that they have to do is go in with the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.425" offset="7837675">They go even a bit further in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.133" offset="7848438">They state that even though it is shown as a matter of fact that reciprocity does not in fact exist, they can still take the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.848" offset="7895353">Now feel that if that is the interpretation to be placed upon this section of the treaty then it defeats the purpose of the reciprocity as set out in the preamble to the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.884" offset="7947494">It really defeats the purpose of the treaty itself, in other words, to grant reciprocal rights in certain instances to citizens of Greece and citizens of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.094" offset="8004336">They've also referred to the case of Clark versus Allen, which was decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1947 and I will admit, that particular case gives the appellee some difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.586" offset="8062328">The distinguishing feature, however, we believe is that the statute or the treaty provision under which it was decided is stated in different terms than this particular treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.341" offset="8129306">This particular treaty sets out in Section 1, the rights that are to be acquired and in Section 2 as to how the property is to be disposed of and we feel that this is the distinguishing features as far as Clark versus Allen is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.364" offset="8229407">Now, the question was asked as to whether or not the burden could have been met in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.583" offset="8258247">I call attention to the Court to the fact that in this case, a Greek law expert was called to testify, that this expert who would been a member of both the United States Bar and the Athens Bar was not at any time asked the simple question as to whether or not the rights in Greece were reciprocal as far as the citizen of the United States was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.273" offset="8373081">We see that there is no great burden as far as proving the reciprocity is concerned should the appellants in this particular case have cared to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.486" offset="8421878">But, they chose to sit on their interpretation of the treaty, which we feel goes beyond the plain meaning of the words of the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.678" offset="8466704">Now, the question was also asked by this Court as to whether or not this applies to personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.025" offset="8500036">There is in Appendix C in the memorandum submitted by the Solicitor General of the United States, an opinion of the Deputy Legal Advisor wherein it is stated that although the terminology of paragraph 2 is vague, that personal property does apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.412" offset="8601600">Well if that is the case, and it is to include all property, personal property or real property, because the word just property is used and that brings in everything, well then the words of Section 1 in themselves are meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.657" offset="8670563">Attention is also directed in the letter where it says the term succession in paragraph 2 in the light of customary references to inheritance of real property and succession of personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.871" offset="8719464">Now, paragraph 2 apparently refers to succession of property, but I think the distinction made there, if that distinction is to be made would almost read out Section 2 as far as real property is concerned, I don't understand how under their interpretation, for paragraph 2 they are going to bring in personal property, because if succession refers to personal property and the terms of the treaty under Section 2 or paragraph 2 referred to succession, then this would seem under their own definition to read out the application of real property, and I don't think that was what is intended by the treaty itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.844" offset="8943282">Now, there's also been some reference made in this case as to reciprocity concerning adoption laws and I think the truth of the matter is that the Trial Court here and the Supreme Court of the United States was -- not the United States, excuse me, State of Iowa was confused what they really in fact were trying to get at is the that they really don't want to recognize an adoption process where the relationship between the adoptive parent and the adoptive child is different than the relationship between the adoptive parent and the adoptive child in Iowa law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.645" offset="9142544">Now, this is completely different from what is intended under the reciprocal rights statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.682" offset="9174727">There isn't any question about that, but what the Iowa law says is and what the Court is trying to say although it doesn't use very good terminology, we're not going to recognize the relationship and if the Iowa Court should in that instance refuse to recognize this relationship as a matter of their own law, then the question as far as reciprocity under the reciprocal rights statute becomes immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.560" offset="9306175">In other words, they don't' acquire anything under Iowa law, therefore, whatever interpretation we might have of the reciprocal right statutes and the application of the treaty in it just isn't material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.649" offset="9370540">It's the whole point of it, but unfortunately and I will agree that the language used by both the Trial Court and the Supreme Court of Iowa doesn't spell it out as explicitly as it should, but I think the facts in the case and I think implicit in any analysis of the case would be that under Iowa law, the process of adoption herein isn't really being recognized, at least recognized as far as granting rights under the Iowa law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.138" offset="9496451">Now, this is different than recognizing the adoption as having been made in Greece.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.163" offset="9520588">This is to say that the adoption under Iowa law isn't going to be given effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.075" offset="9544202">For instance, the adoption relationship is a matter of local law and I don't think there's any question that Iowa can make the determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.356" offset="9589342">Now, whether or not the foreign country or wherever it happens to be, it could be another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.942" offset="9619749">It might have differing adoption laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.486" offset="9629884">I think they can make that distinction and the Court is bound by it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2609.684" offset="10438635">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.175" offset="10456607">The question has come up as to whether Clark versus Allen is really applicable to this case and again, all I can reiterate is what was said in spite of the appellee's Counsel's comments that Clark versus Allen, we believe stands on all fours of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.617" offset="10514390">The California reciprocal succession statute is identical to the Iowa statute with the one exception that the California statute combines the words real and personal property all in one sentence and the Iowa Court goes through the whole procedure twice, once with reference to real property and the other time with reference to personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.652" offset="10586593">The Treaty Provision, which would be comparable to Section 2 of the Greek Treaty, which was contained in the German treaty, which was construed in the Clark versus Allen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.289" offset="10641136">While the language is slightly different, you can go through it ten times then you can come up with the same conclusion that the language of the pertinent Treaty Provision dealing with real property in the German Treaty is the same as the language in the Greek Treaty and so, we believe that this case should be determined on the basis of the principles enunciated in Clark versus Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.082" offset="10728281">That there is no need by virtue of this Treaty Provision to prove the existence of reciprocal succession rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.590" offset="10754299">The question has come up is, why wasn't reciprocal succession rights proved in the Trial Court and I suppose there's no case that you try that if you could do it over again, you wouldn't do something a little bit different and this would certainly be one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.267" offset="10816993">However, at that time, it was simply felt that the treaty was so clear on the point that there was no need to prove the existence of reciprocals succession rights and no attempt was made to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.762" offset="10858998">Had we had an opportunity again to redo the record, this would undoubtedly be done and this problem would be avoided, but we believe the treaty completely covers the situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2740.540" offset="10962129">Yes, we think that the Section 2 of Article IX clearly provides that where we aren't given National Treatment in the acquisition of property, we are given the right to dispose of it and we're given the limited right of inheritance or a limited right of property pursuant to Section 2 of Article IX.</text>

            <text syncTime="2806.667" offset="11226593">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.882" offset="11231504">There was miscellaneous bar supplies and fixtures, I believe, but in essence, the value in the estate does constitute real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.055" offset="11284167">Now, counsel for the appellant or appellee here has indicated that it is implicit in the decision of the Trial Court and in the Supreme Court of Iowa that the Court is saying that it should not -- it is not recognizing the status of adoption for public policy reasons or whatever reasons it might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.415" offset="11369639">The appellant claims that this is flatly not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.716" offset="11382805">In fact, the Trial Court definitely stated that the status of adoption was conclusive on the Iowa Court and that there had been no -- that the only reason that would not recognize the adoption would be if there was fraud shown and it said that after examining the evidence there was no fraud in the obtaining of the decree of adoption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.899" offset="11471517">And so, it concluded with the statement that the status of adoption was conclusive on the Iowa Court and then and only then did it go into the question of whether Section 567.8 conflicted with the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.508" offset="11521985">We think again this case is controlled by the case of Clark versus Allen, that the intent of the parties who negotiated the treaty should be given great weight and I would again call the attention to the Court to the opinion of Andreas F. Lowenfeld acting Legal Advisor for the Secretary of State, which is contained in the Appendix B to the brief submitted by the Solicitor General wherein he states, the Department of State is of the opinion that the treaty eliminates any necessity of approving reciprocity of treatment where the property in question is realty and thus subject to Article IX. Another Legal Advisor for the Department of State as I indicated says that he believes that this also applies to personality, but at least where there is realty involved, there is no need for proving reciprocity of treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.675" offset="11730651">And so therefore, we feel that the decision of the Iowa Supreme Court should be reversed in this case remanded to lower for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.696" offset="11758759">Thank you.</text>
