            <label>Mr. Allen B.Pierson, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="43.140" offset="172513">Mr. Chief Justice Warren, and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.903" offset="191530">The facts surrounding this case are painfully clear and simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.866" offset="211383">It involves a felony murder case from the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.337" offset="233326">The murder occurred during the commission of an armed robbery on October 7, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.683" offset="254642">The facts are that the accused below, Wayne Turner, arrived at Hammond, Louisiana, hungry and broke.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.035" offset="284108">During the armed robbery of a Phillips 66 Service Station, the attendant at the station drew a 38 caliber revolver from his pocket and began shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.887" offset="331546">Turner shot back and of course the attendant was killed almost instantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.164" offset="356624">Turner and his wife both confessed to the murder the following day.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.809" offset="375223">Both were indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.478" offset="381910">The wife was allowed to plead guilty to manslaughter and is now out on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.493" offset="405943">The trial of Wayne Turner lasted three days in the 21st Judicial District Court of the Parish of Tangipahoa, State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.895" offset="435513">This is the district or trial court in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.572" offset="450247">During these three days, the petty jury consisting of 12 men was in the custody of among other deputies or bailiffs, Deputies Rispone and Chief Criminal Deputy Hulon Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.284" offset="505104">Now, Deputy Rispone and Deputy Simmons were both witnesses for the prosecution in the trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.784" offset="531122">Deputy Rispone testified that he was the first to arrive at the scene of the crime, that he made the official investigation and report.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.277" offset="565081">He further testified that he heard Wayne Turner admit to having committed the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.634" offset="590472">He further testified that Wayne Turner had led him to the site of certain incriminating evidence consisting of a murder weapon and certain identification cards belonging to Turner.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.033" offset="632059">Rispone also testified in connection with establishing the chain of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.888" offset="651494">Deputy Hulon Simmons testified that he had received the confession which was allegedly free and voluntarily given.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.922" offset="679602">This is a written confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.483" offset="689842">In addition, Deputy Simmons testified as to the chain of evidence and as to certain admissions made by Turner of his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.172" offset="720666">A motion for mistrial and the motion for a new trial were both overruled and this Court after an adverse decision from the State Supreme Court of Louisiana granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.116" offset="772389">Both the motion for mistrial and the motion for a new trial were based basically on the fact that these bailiffs are deputies or chief prosecution witnesses but not only that that during the course of this trial, these witnesses had mingled with, had fraternized with, had become a part of and identified with the petty jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.660" offset="862563">In other words that they had conducted themselves in such a way not to shield the jury from outside communication but had actually communicated unnecessarily and visited with the jury unnecessarily themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.950" offset="919719">The basic issue before this Court is we believe one of constitutional importance and that is does the accused in a capital case especially in a capital case have a right to a trial by jury which is untainted with the suspicion of misconduct or must the accused go further and actually proved prejudice or misconduct that these things did happen that the fraternization did take place is on question.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.651" offset="1058586">I might point out that the same type of conduct also occurred in another Louisiana case arising out of the same trial court which was tried only months before the Turner case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.093" offset="1104353">That was the case of State versus McAlister which is cited in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.431" offset="1129639">These things did happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.709" offset="1138834">I believe that the Louisiana courts have failed to clearly distinguish between separation and seclusion and that this imparts the counts for the error that they've fallen into.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.045" offset="1188153">Separation is defined on page 8 of respondent's brief is the physical separation of one juror from another.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.922" offset="1223680">Seclusion, however, means simply to be cut off from outside communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.259" offset="1244996">Now, the Louisiana statute in point is revised statutes 15:394 which is set forth in full in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.832" offset="1279269">This statute used the words “keep together.”</text>
            <text syncTime="323.911" offset="1295569">What could these words mean except that the jury is to be kept together not to be physically separated.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.639" offset="1322527">The statute also uses the words “secluded from outside communication.”</text>
            <text syncTime="336.852" offset="1347396">What could this possibly mean except that the jury is not to communicate unnecessarily with members or with anyone except its on members.</text>

            <text syncTime="345.779" offset="1383027">What was the extent of the fraternization that you've mentioned?</text>

            <text syncTime="349.768" offset="1399014">Your Honor, the extent of the fraternization is set forth in the printed record the -- it consists of really three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.091" offset="1436317">First of all, there was a separation of the jury on approximately nine occasions and three separate automobiles when they were taken to and returned from a restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.754" offset="1478949">In addition, on of these occasions, one juror Mr. Paul Casanova was separated alone from the other jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.083" offset="1512281">In other words, it was an 11 to one separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.199" offset="1524715">Mr. Casanova was in a company of deputies Simmons and Rispone on this occasion and in the company possibly of another unidentified deputy.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.873" offset="1559406">At page 37 of the printed record, you will note that Deputy Simmons testified that while he was paying the check at the restaurant, Paul Casanova, the juror was alone with Deputy Rispone and/or some unidentified third person.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.623" offset="1630459">We intend to show and I will develop it just a little later that under Louisiana law itself this creates a presumption of prejudice and it's certainly under the federal constitution in presumption if prejudice arises.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.142" offset="1704542">Your Honor, the defense was not able to prove by the very nature of things any actual misconduct or prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.649" offset="1738501">However, the very fact that Mr. Casanova was separated and was alone with this deputy witness who was a chief witness for the prosecution under the federal decisions in the case a presumption of prejudice sufficient to set the verdict aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.757" offset="1814988">In addition under the Louisiana decisions, a mere physical separation of the jury raises a presumption or prejudice sufficient to set the verdict aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.459" offset="1857829">In each of these cases, of course, the State has the opportunity to come in and to prove that there was no prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="614.691" offset="2458749">Not before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.567" offset="2462198">No sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.117" offset="2472438">In the state case of State versus Hornsby, the Court was dealing with a physical separation and said, “In Tampa, cases upon a separation, misconduct and abuse will always be presumed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="630.979" offset="2523847">Certainly in the instant case, there was a separation on at least nine occasions traveling to and from the restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.823" offset="2551223">On one of these occasions there was an 11 to one separation and Mr. Casanova was in the company of Deputy Respone later joined by Deputy Simmons both bailiffs, both witnesses for the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.940" offset="2611722">It is not every separation of course which will be sufficient to set aside the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.127" offset="2640457">What I'm really saying is that the State in some cases is successful in proving that there was no prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.716" offset="2666789">For example, in State versus Smith, a case involving 12 jurors filing through a door, the door blew shut just before the 12 juror made it through.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.303" offset="2701166">He opened the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.067" offset="2704196">This was an accidental and momentary separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.818" offset="2715272">Obviously there was no prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.631" offset="2722482">Obviously, the verdict was not set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.440" offset="2733662">It's precisely into this niche in the law that three of the four cases cited by respondents fit and that is the State versus Sharbino.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.380" offset="2769502">One juror remained in the jury room as the other 11 filed into the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.676" offset="2790609">The Court immediately sent the 11 back.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.252" offset="2800953">They got the missing juror and immediately filed back into the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.182" offset="2816627">This also was a momentary and accidental separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.831" offset="2831256">There was no possibility that any of the jurors could have been contacted during the separation, therefore, the verdict was not set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.917" offset="2863647">In State versus Fuller, two jurors ate at the same table with an outsider in a restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.815" offset="2887158">It later developed that the outsider had been a member of the grand jury which had indicted the man being tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.451" offset="2913802">The verdict was not set aside because the Court found positively that there was no prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.290" offset="2937104">But even here, the presumption arose because there had been a separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.638" offset="2958524">In State versus Davis and other Louisiana case, also cited by respondents, the jury was accorded in five rooms n a hotel suite.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.692" offset="2994678">The rooms were accessible only through the room in which the deputy sheriff slept.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.847" offset="3011291">The deputy in this case was not a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.109" offset="3024353">Therefore, even though there was a separation, because obviously, they were separated into five different rooms, the Court did not overturn the verdict because there had been no breach of the seclusion of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.204" offset="3076807">The jury could not possibly have been contacted by an outside, a person or persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.718" offset="3098854">It is interesting to note also in the Davis case that the deputy slept in a separate room.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.933" offset="3119647">The deputy did not mingle with and fraternized with the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.631" offset="3142426">The instant case is not analogous to those cases because the separation was not momentary.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.546" offset="3166145">It was not accidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.149" offset="3172519">Certainly after the McAllister case, only a few months before this case, in the same court, involving the same sheriff's office and involving the same chief criminal deputy Hulon Simmons who had been questioned at length on this question in the McAllister case.</text>

            <text syncTime="932.491" offset="3729868">As to the matter of seclusion of the jury members from outside communication, the respondent has cited the case of State versus Migis.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.781" offset="3775112">In this case, the doctor entered the jury room at night in order to treat a sick juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.366" offset="3801443">Now, the Court said that there was no separation and there was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.241" offset="3832895">However, what the report really should have said was that there was no violation of the law requiring the jury to be secluded because the doctor simply entered the room, treated the juror and left.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.059" offset="3880229">He did not converse with the other members of the jury, swapping stories or telling jokes, planning fishing trips or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.966" offset="3915860">He simply treated the man and left.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.932" offset="3923696">There was no fraternization, no mingling and therefore the seclusion of the jury was not violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.177" offset="3956611">In State versus Oteri practically the same circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.187" offset="3972702">Only in this case, instead of being a doctor, he was a barber.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.266" offset="3985032">But there again, there was no mingling, no fraternization, no separation and therefore no violation of the seclusion requirement of the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.493" offset="4029962">Now I realized that the law generally over the United States is that a bailiff simply because he is a prosecution witness is not per se precluded from acting his bailiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.616" offset="4078446">However, it is the contention of the petitioners that it is one thing to be a bailiff and it is quite another to mingle with the jury and to fraternize with them unnecessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.696" offset="4122749">Certainly, if counsel for the defense or the defendant himself in that trial or any of the defendant's witnesses had so mingled with the jury, this would have been grounds for a mistrial on the part of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.611" offset="4610403">Now, mere persons of the bailiff and especially of a bailiff witness in a jury room during the actual deliberations is always to my knowledge been held as grounds for reversible error and rightly so because this prevents the free exchange of ideas among the jury members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.539" offset="4710087">However, in the instant case, we do not know, I don't suppose there was any that Rispone and Simmons were actually in the jury room during the deliberations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1213.924" offset="4855641">In that case, after the final charge was given by the judge and the case was in the jury's hands, the jury was taken out to supper before they actually began the deliberations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1241.583" offset="4966296">The Court in the Shermer case set the verdict aside and I'd like to quote briefly from its opinion where the opinion in criminal trials, the officers of the state who were actively engaged in the prosecution in furtherance of their official duties as were Simmons and Rispone in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.356" offset="5045394">And who by their activity and attitude indicate a part of an interest in the outcome of the case, must be held to represent the state in the trial and that their conduct so far as it relates to the jury must be regarded as a conduct of the opposite party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.254" offset="5104953">And so it should have been in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.247" offset="5112895">Simmons and Rispone were very actively identified in the prosecution of the state's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.538" offset="5134106">Both were witnesses for the state, important witnesses and both testified before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.512" offset="5162005">That they were prejudiced possibly not intentionally so to the extent of intentionally falsifying their testimony but that they did have certain feelings as it was brought out by the testimony of Deputy Simmons on page 35 of the record where he was challenged by defense counsel on his use of the term hitting the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.099" offset="5272346">In fact the evidence was not hidden at all, it had simply had been thrown on the ground over a wide area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.991" offset="5295961">It is such thing as this that color a witness' testimony that the jury must past on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1334.630" offset="5338488">The federal view has long been that prejudice will be presumed in cases where there has been a violation of the requirement that the jury be secluded from outside communication, thus, in United States versus Morin, the case that I already alluded to in the prosecution of a railroad baggage man for possession of stolen property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.304" offset="5425215">The conviction was set aside because the juror had communicated on a friendly basis with the government witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.110" offset="5460428">It was not proven that the case had been discussed though the Court did suspicion that it had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.556" offset="5482162">But the Court went on to say that even so, this raises great access to the -- whether or not the defendant has had a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.829" offset="5515285">The same is true in the case of Wheaton versus the United States where the bailiff actually helped the jury in the mechanics of the voting procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.677" offset="5550707">Here again the verdict was set aside or no -- excuse me, I believe in this case it was remanded for a hearing as to whether or not the accused had actually been prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.158" offset="5588532">In the case of Little versus the United States, the stenographer read to the jury from her shorthand notes the charge or part of the charge of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.778" offset="5627089">Certainly, the scenario for which reading only what the judge had already told the jury, it's a little difficult to see prejudice but the conviction was struck down on the grounds that the Court did not know what have actually transpired in the jury room and that perhaps the stenographer put emphasis on the wrong words or made a shorthand character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.725" offset="5710890">For this reason, the defendant's rights to a fair and impartial trial have been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.664" offset="5730638">The respondent in his brief approves the matters overlying the Little decisions which says that the facts here are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.345" offset="5757283">Certainly they are different as to the basic facts in the case, and yet as to the rationale of the decisions, I see a very little difference of it any at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.871" offset="5795422">They are all based on unauthorized and unnecessary communication between petty jurors and third persons and in some cases third persons who are witnesses which is our case here today.</text>

            <text syncTime="1929.750" offset="7718975">I'd like to point out for the Court's special attention the case of State versus Woods which is cited in the briefs and I quoted from it at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.424" offset="7753665">That case is one from the State of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.566" offset="7770175">It's a leading case in Indiana and it's practically on all force with the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.504" offset="7793998">In that case, the deputy sheriffs, both witnesses and non-witnesses were allowed to mingle with the jury during the progress of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.159" offset="7840601">There was no question that this had happens just as there's no question that it happened in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.378" offset="7865469">There was no attempt to say that this happened only during the deliberations of the jury that happened only during the course of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.201" offset="7900787">Interestingly enough, it was not a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.454" offset="7917714">The highest court in Indiana struck down the conviction and I've quoted from that case at length in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.313" offset="7953241">I don't think that it's necessary to reread that but the court simply said that regardless of whether or not the defendant can prove any actual misconduct, in the actual prejudice to his cause, the mere fact that this thing happened unnecessarily is presumption enough and calls for a new trial on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.804" offset="8051148">I don't think they used the word constitutional but certainly this was in the back of their minds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.330" offset="8069224">In the Shermer case which is actually one of those cases dealing with the presence of the bailiff during the deliberations of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.680" offset="8122619">The court also struck down the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.092" offset="8132336">However, I should point out to you that in the Shermer case, the bailiff was not in the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.433" offset="8149682">He did not actually hear the deliberations of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.370" offset="8161384">This was simply the case where after the case was submitted to the jury, the bailiff witness accompanied the jury to the restaurant and sat with them as they ate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.353" offset="8201404">Now, I see no real distinction between that kind of a case and the case which we have at bar where the bailiff again accompanies the jury to the restaurant and sits with him as deputy Simmons admittedly did on at least two occasions because there the jury is not deliberating, he is not discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.097" offset="8272353">They're simply being created a bond of rapport of friendship between the witness and the juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.281" offset="8321045">It is the intention of petitioners that the accused constitutional right to a trial by an impartial jury has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.268" offset="8365035">First under state law because a presumption arises when there is a physical separation of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.907" offset="8395546">A presumption likewise arises under federal law when there is an unnecessary and unauthorized communication between the juror and another witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.576" offset="8438282">Under the Little case, on the Maddox case, on the Morin case which I have already mentioned, it would appear that this presumption ought to arise under state law because these cases tend to place it on a constitutional basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.172" offset="8504633">The Woods case I've just quoted -- cited to you indicates that the presumption of prejudice arising out on such a situation cannot be overcome by the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2150.673" offset="8602645">I am going to pass along on the facts although they may not be completely at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.810" offset="8631171">There is an attempt by the defense counsel to suggest the possibility of self defense by a felon in the perpetration of a crime by stating that the attendant at the billing station fired first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.680" offset="8710687">There is no evidence in the record even the transcript to the original case or in the transcript to the record before this honorable court along that point but be that as it may if it was so, there is no self defense available to a person in the perpetration of the felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.548" offset="8798145">Now before we can fully understand the mechanics of a small country parish, it would probably be best to describe it to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.619" offset="8834403">Tangipahoa Parish is approximately 50 miles long and approximately 12 to 14 miles wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.130" offset="8872438">There are approximately 12 deputies to handle that parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.086" offset="8896261">These deputies have such various duties as serving summons, making arrests, keeping the peace, transferring prisoners to Angola from the parish prison, attending funerals as escorts, summonsing jurors, attending to juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.820" offset="8987272">In other words, their duties are manifest and widely vary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.214" offset="9020813">If you would have a crime which involved six or eight deputies as witnesses, it would become an -- almost another impossibility to exclude all of those deputies who participated in an investigation of the case from -- in some manner coming into contact with the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.404" offset="9117571">Now, just as it is a country parish in that respect, so it is with the eating facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.326" offset="9149231">Our parish has no facilities in the courthouse for feeding the jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.547" offset="9174100">It is necessary when the time comes to eat for them to repair to a small restaurant about two miles west of Amite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.689" offset="9210671">This is usually done in school buses or if a school bus is not available, several deputies' cars to escort them from the courthouse to the eating facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.642" offset="9266469">Here again we're confronted with a condition of circumstance, either they eat that way or they don't eat and if you're going to have a three-day trial hungry juries is not a very -- a very good jury to have listening to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.223" offset="9352882">It was on one of these excursions to the restaurant that the so-called separation of the juror Casanova took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.857" offset="9407425">It is fully explained in the transcript of the record upon Mr. Simmons how it occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.233" offset="9436891">He had left to go pay the check and while he went to pay the check, he left the juror Casanova in the company of Deputy Rispone and another deputy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.859" offset="9483389">Now, of course, defense counsel seeks to unknowingly unwittingly possibly to have a double explanation of the separation of this juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.649" offset="9530514">In one instance, he says, he was with Rispone alone and in another he said he was with Rispone and another party which would attempt to suggest that there was some outsider who was present with the deputy and the juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.412" offset="9605642">Now, while there may be some difference between the separation and the seclusion which I agreed to, it is quoted in Article 394 of the Louisiana Criminal Cod, from the moment of acceptance until the rendition of the verdict to the entry of the mistrial that juror should be kept under the charge of an officer in such a way as to be secluded from all outside communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.682" offset="9734687">Now, I think it's readily apparent what the purpose of this article is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.754" offset="9763004">Somewhere along the line, we have to appoint someone who is responsible for this jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.695" offset="9782753">If it's not the deputy sheriff it's going to be someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.663" offset="9802606">The duty of this officer whoever he maybe is to see first that that jury is kept as intact as humanly and practically possible and to also see that no one from the outside gets to that jury to attempt to taint them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.477" offset="9889855">And if those two items are taken cared of other deputies, we feel that no violation of rights has taken place.</text>
