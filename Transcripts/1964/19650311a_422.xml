            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="10.074" offset="40229">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.547" offset="54126">I think, first, I should create a correct an inadvertent the statement that I made yesterday, although it's not a point, it's not very essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.849" offset="99370">There is testimony in the record at page is 1664 and 1665, to the effect that in 1950 the wholesale grocery business was declining, and that Consolidated, then began to move into the retail field.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.845" offset="175334">It bought some chains which are identified in briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.200" offset="192784">It also attempted to organize some retailers, and the Cardinal Stores on a somewhat loser basis without buying into them, but making them a chain that it would help to manage.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.083" offset="240327">As far as I can ascertain, the record does not show, how far Consolidated had become engaged in purchasing for resale at retail, and how far it was still purchasing for resale at wholesale, by the time this record was closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.880" offset="311484">But, I don't think the point is of the essence, because in any event it was a large buyer, and I suppose also we don't lay any stress on it, that it's power as a buyer for immediate sale at retail was perhaps more important than it's power as a buyer, as a wholesaler where it would have to buy what it could sell instead of choosing what went on shelves itself, but I don't make anything at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.234" offset="412839">I just want to correct any misapprehension I might have left with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.501" offset="433946">Now, yesterday, I was directing myself throughout the argument to the question whether the commission was warranted, leaving the evidence of post-acquisition market behavior aside for the moment, was warranted in finding that this merger created a probable injury to competition, within the meaning of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.858" offset="543347">In a nutshell, the case, I think comes down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.354" offset="561319">The record shows, that Consolidated was a customer of concerns buying from 25% to 50% of the onion and garlic.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.263" offset="608967">Indeed, that it was a customer of firms buying 25% from the Gentry division, that became part of Consolidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.541" offset="654106">It was also a very large purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.129" offset="668421">In addition, the record shows that the merger gave Consolidated at the absolute dominant position in the onion and garlic market and as I said before, 25% of all sales were made to its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.516" offset="746057">We also know as a matter of fact, that Consolidated was ready, able and willing, and it was ready and willing and at least in some cases able to use its purchasing power to acquire sales, to break into the new markets of garlic and onion.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.087" offset="832261">I think, we know as a matter of commonsense and of commercial experience, that buying power in other markets can be used and has been used in a number of instances with devastating affect in foreclosing the market you are concerned with, two independent competitors who lack that leverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.694" offset="922749">Now, we would say taking this together, and still for the moment, leaving aside the post-acquisition evidence, that it's indeed a necessary inference, that the combination of the two powers creates or may substantially lessen competition within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.442" offset="1013760">That it creates sufficient probability of injury to independent competitor to cause Section 7 to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.168" offset="1044584">That was the conclusion that the District Court and the Third Circuit reached in a comparable situation, in the Ingersoll Rand case cited in our briefs, but we don't need to go quite that far here.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.205" offset="1092754">All we need to argue is that the Federal Trade Commission could draw this conclusion, because after all, the very purpose of creating the Federal Trade Commission, as this court pointed out in the Cement Institute case, I wish I'd quoted it in my brief, the whole purpose of setting up the commission was to have a body that was capable of appraising the affects.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.046" offset="1200170">In that case, various competitive practices with Basing Point System, under Section 7 of the Clayton Act as amended of appraising the effects of various structural changes in the market, and what they were likely to do to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.560" offset="1262237">The commission, remember, was according to legislative history made the principal instrument for enforcing Section 7, so that it's expertise could be brought to bare.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.794" offset="1307167">I think in the sense, the answer to the argument that the respondents make here, about there being no evidence concerning the degree of probability is that, the answer that was made in the Republic Aviation case in dealing with the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.597" offset="1370384">There, the proof showed only that there was a company rule, barring the solicitation of union members of the plant and wearing of union buttons.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.714" offset="1422838">And the company argued well there was no testimony concerning the extent to which this will interfere with union organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.973" offset="1451886">And the company replies that, that's something -- the court replied that is something for an expert body like the Labor Board to infer from the facts, one of the purposes it said which lead to the creation of such boards is to have decisions based upon evidential facts under the particular statue, made by experienced officials with an adequate appreciation of the subject interested their administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.243" offset="1556898">To move to still another area in the Market Street Railway case, it was held at a Public Utilities Commission could infer that a lowering of the rates, and being a fares on a Street Railway could infer without direct testimony that that would resolved in an increase of passenger traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.745" offset="1642893">And the same thing has been applied during the Cement Institute case, and in the Morton Salt case to the Federal Trade Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.610" offset="1718439">And I will deal with that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.079" offset="1728261">The answer in a sentence Justice Harlan that I will elaborate is that we think that the evidence was relevant, but not such as to compel the conclusion that the threat to competition was not sufficiently substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.407" offset="1797538">The post-acquisition evidence falls essentially into two parts, one is the statistical part, showing that during the subsequent years, it's about seven years, seven-and-a-half years that in the garlic market, Consolidated lost shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.020" offset="1900042">It didn't have as large a percentage as before.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.095" offset="1912372">Indeed, the share fell from 51% to 39%.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.082" offset="1936300">In the onion market, its share went up 25%.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.082" offset="1952287">25% of what it had been before, it had been 28% and it became 35%.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="525.481" offset="2101917">Technological change with respect to the onions was there in which they eliminated the woods splinters.</text>

          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="529.782" stopTime="1049.845">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="529.782" offset="2119053">Yes and there was also with respect to the garlic, a failure to keep pace with the technological competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.283" offset="2153117">We say essentially two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.916" offset="2163566">First, we rely on the point the commission made that the failure to gain in both markets, a larger share maybe explainable only by the fact that Consolidated wasn't using all its power during this period, and we are concerned with power not actual consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.312" offset="2257189">Second, we suggest that the proof of the movement in the sales does not show that the reciprocal purchasing power was not operable as a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.414" offset="2325629">True, it is only one factor that comes into play, but we don't suggest that quality, price and things like that were not elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.165" offset="2368575">Indeed in this respect, it seems to be and again I wish the case within our brief, that this case is very similar to the DuPont Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.133" offset="2400444">There are other differences, but you'll recall it in the DuPont case the argument was made that DuPont did not enjoy a constant share of General Motor's business that after the acquisition at times it share declined and there was testimony and a finding by the District Court, that General Motors was concerned with price and quality, in purchasing its paints, the leather that it acquired from DuPont and others, but, the court said that all those facts didn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.480" offset="2541819">That the evidence did show that DuPont by acquiring the General Motors Stock had acquired an ability to get sales on a basis other than price, quality, and the normal competitive thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.547" offset="2598139">So, here we say that Consolidated had acquired that capacity, and it may well have been, that it used it in some instances and not in others.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.131" offset="2652473">Now, as a matter of fact I think the evidence very strongly suggests that it may well have been holding some sales in acquiring others on the basis of its purchasing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.644" offset="2698553">So, far as the garlic went, there was testimony by Dr. Prater to the affect that for many years they've been the leader in garlic, had the best quality and the largest share, but that they lost that because they had not spend the time, money and effort, and had not built a separate plant to handle garlic, had not carried on research.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.838" offset="2787265">So, it's not surprising that they lost sales, even though this was a factor in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.899" offset="2811507">On the other hand, if you turn and look at the onions, they were gaining sales 7% of the whole, an additional 25% over what they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.340" offset="2869290">It's suggested in the brief of the company, well, the figures don't show that purchasing power had -- and it came into play because we sold on 33% of the whole market in 1936, and we sold only 31% and lower percentages of the sales, of the groups of companies who were our suppliers in the processed foods market.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.272" offset="2985064">Now, of course, all that shows is that there were some people who bought Consolidated's onions, who bought more than 33% of their onions from the Consolidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.027" offset="3028010">I think, the really important test would be how did Consolidated fair among its suppliers, where its purchasing power might come into play as compared to the part of the market which apparently was not its suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.130" offset="3092480">Now, we do know who its suppliers were in this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.780" offset="3111079">We don't know what they bought in particular years, but it's a constant universe, and the figures are quite interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.294" offset="3141172">In 1951, the sales to those who were Consolidated suppliers, were one million eight roughly and the sales to others who were not among its suppliers, where one million seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.647" offset="3198537">By 1955, the sales to its suppliers were 2 billion 5, that's a 35% increase and the sales to others were down to one million three, a 30% decrease.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.206" offset="3264784">By 1958, the sales to suppliers were up to four million six that would be a 146% increase over 1951, and the sales to others were down to one million six, still not what they were in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.900" offset="3347540">Now, 1951 may not be an entirely reliable base year.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.886" offset="3367497">So I ran a similar check taking 1950 as a base.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.552" offset="3386201">You find that Consolidated Gentry sales rose from two million one to six million – looks as if I must made a mistake, to six million two -- oh!</text>
            <text syncTime="860.763" offset="3443043">That's the total, from two million one to six million two and that 80% of that was attributable to set sales to Consolidated suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.682" offset="3486720">So, it was doing much better in the market where it did have this -- in the part of the market where it did have this leverage, so far as onion went, then it was in the other part.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.321" offset="3525277">And of course any technological change would be operable in both parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.476" offset="3541891">Now, I don't contend, I want to make it very clear, that this shows the reciprocal purchasing power at work, because the commission didn't find that.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.643" offset="3586508">All I argue is that this shows that the post-acquisition evidence isn't very compelling, that you could draw various inferences from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.339" offset="3633319">That it says sort of [Inaudible] you can look at it one way or look at it another way, and that consequently commission were simply entitled to take into account along with the risk, that they concluded that ultimate question was whether an improper power carrying sufficient probability of injury had been interjected into this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.995" offset="3731958">Now the other part of the testimony concerning the post-acquisition period was direct evidence from various suppliers to Consolidated and purchasers of onions and garlic from Consolidated, saying well, we weren't influenced by the threats of purchasing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.650" offset="3818580">To that very briefly, we give much the same answer that we gave in the case of the statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.988" offset="3847941">First, we say, that there were instances where admittedly its purchasing power did pry open the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.844" offset="3887334">Second, we say, that if you look at all the evidence with respect to the firms that testified, that they were influenced by Consolidated's purchasing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.060" offset="3940206">You find a number of instances where they was controversy, where they was other testimony that threw doubt on that direct evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.835" offset="3971239">That's particularly true in the case Gerber's Foods and the Morgan Packing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.165" offset="3992660">So that again we think, first of the instances in which it countered the purchasing power are more important than the instances in which it didn't, because those were the proofs that there was some power and second, it adds to the other, again to inquire into the particular facts in the post-acquisition period, which isn't too long when one thinks of being probable life of this industry in the long run development, that the commission was certainly entitled to hold fast to those facts that where known about market structure, and it based conclusion upon them, instead of being compelled to disregard to compelled by the debatable post-acquisition evidence to reach a contrary conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.921" offset="4183667">I would like Mr. Chief Justice to save what time I've left for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1682.058" offset="6728202">Now what does reciprocity opportunity mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.040" offset="6740114">All it means is that there are some companies that could or do sell to Consolidated and could or do buy from Gentry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.824" offset="6779193">This sheds absolutely no light on whether reciprocal buying will actually result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1707.822" offset="6831229">I suggest to the Court that relying on opportunity for reciprocal buying to prove effect is precisely the vice of the Federal Trade Commission's decision and this was the reason why it was overturned by the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.580" offset="6894237">I want to say right now that of course the Federal Trade Commission as the Solicitor General has said, recited the proper Section 7 test, but mere recitation of the proper test by the commission does not foreclose this Court from examining the decision on the record to see whether they properly applied that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.400" offset="6969574">The question is still whether on the record as a whole, there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.821" offset="7003220">Now the Solicitor General for the first time in this case, for the first time relies on the role of the commission as an expert body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.946" offset="7039687">Nobody has suggested that argument until we were before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.208" offset="7060793">The Solicitor General said yesterday and I quote “that the commission is entitled to draw on its experience in concluding that creating an opportunity for reciprocity carries a potential or demonstrating effect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.920" offset="7119621">And he went on to say and I quote again “that the commission has no obligation to introduce direct evidence on this point.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.451" offset="7157760">The case is that the Solicitor General has cited to you this morning are cases where it is clear even from the brief statement that he gave to you where the administrative agency had clear and actual experience with the problem where this role of expertise was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.254" offset="7236963">So, far as I know outside of three transportation industry cases in the 1930s, the Federal Trade Commission has never had any experience with reciprocity and those three cases I submit are very unusual cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.805" offset="7299135">In each of them, there was coercive reciprocity proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.046" offset="7316167">In each of them, there was a market where the conditions were particularly conducive to reciprocal dealing and I will demonstrate to you shortly that those kind of conditions aren't here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.947" offset="7359739">Third, in each one of those cases there was paucity than overwhelming proof of the effectiveness of the reciprocity of actually reciprocal dealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.162" offset="7404565">I do not believe that the commission would itself espouse the test that has now been suggested by the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.017" offset="7439987">I invite the Court's attention to the fact that the Federal Trade Commission has had much more experience with horizontal mergers than it has had with conglomerate mergers or with reciprocity creating mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.949" offset="7487739">And yet, the Federal Trade Commission has never suggested that it can rely on its role as an expert in solving even a horizontal merger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.341" offset="7521280">I should like to read to you if I may a very brief quotation from the Commission's decision in the second Proctor &amp; Gamble case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.193" offset="7552731">This opinion was written by Commissioner Elman and I believe that he there repudiates in so many words the theory now suggested by the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.627" offset="7594423">In every Section 7 proceeding, the burden is on the complainant to prove that the merger will create a reasonable probability of a substantial lessening of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.503" offset="7641966">This burden is not met in any case by invocation of a talismanic per se rule by which to dispense with the need or adducing evidence of probable anti competitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.603" offset="7698390">In every case, the determination of illegality, if made, must rest on specific facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.860" offset="7727438">And I suggest that this completely repudiates the Solicitor General's suggestion that on the point of actual probability of reciprocal buying the commission need not introduce any direct evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.727" offset="7778847">I should like to also mention to the Court that adoption of a rule that would give affect to the Commission's role as an expert in Section 7 cases would create a tremendous problem because of the dual enforcement of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.558" offset="7838198">You have Federal District court deciding Section 7 cases and you have the Federal Trade Commission deciding them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.201" offset="7864738">The report of the Attorney General's committee on the Antitrust Law said, that establishing different standards for application by these two agencies, one agency in a court, would create chaotic consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.559" offset="7922207">I believe that just thinking about it will show you that if you give the commission one role in Section 7 and the district court another role, then the Courts of Appeals and this Court are going to have a very difficult problem of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.871" offset="7983438">Finally, I suggest that at the most any reliance on the Commission's role as an expert can only create a rebuttable presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.779" offset="8023040">Surely, this cannot foreclose the respondent from coming in and proving that the presumption does not apply and that the assumption cannot be accepted and that is what we've proved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.402" offset="8085525">The Solicitor General has emphasized in his argument, this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.131" offset="8108513">Since at the time of the merger, in 1951, Consolidated suppliers were already purchasing from Gentry approximately 25% of the total domestic dehydrated onion and garlic supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.584" offset="8166296">The merger had an immediate impact on that share of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.395" offset="8193567">I suggest you that this is just a [Inaudible] reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.377" offset="8209450">It assumes that the company that was buying from Gentry on the day before the merger on April 1, 1951 for reasons of price, service and quality is somehow on the day after the merger buying from Gentry simply because Consolidated is a customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.245" offset="8284891">But, whether this kind of reciprocal buying will result is precisely the whole problem of this case and I do not see how it can be solved by assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.097" offset="8328359">There is a major point in this case to which the Solicitor General has not addressed himself and I should like to make it by quoting from his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.014" offset="8367961">The Commission's conclusion regarding the anti competitive effective merger was also supported by it's analysis of the market structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.451" offset="8401711">This showed that none of Gentry's competitor was in a in a position to exert similar reciprocity pressures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.446" offset="8433685">Now this spotlights are very key defect in the whole government's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.817" offset="8451239">In every reciprocal buying situation there are two markets, not just one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.749" offset="8474958">The first market is the market where Consolidated buys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.541" offset="8490109">That market is the thousands of food processors all over the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.538" offset="8510067">The second market is the market where if reciprocal buying exists in the first market, you can have an effect on competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.037" offset="8544131">That second market here is the market consisting of producers of dehydrated onion and garlic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.723" offset="8570880">The Solicitor General like the commission prefers to talk entirely about that second market but as I have said there can be an effect in the second market only if reciprocal buying operates in the first and neither the Federal Trade Commission, nor the Solicitor General anywhere has undertaken an analysis of the key market, the food processing market to see if it is conducive to reciprocal buying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.322" offset="8681221">We did and that's the kind of evidence that goes to the heart to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.406" offset="8705567">I should like now to address myself to this problem of post acquisition evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.167" offset="8724584">The Solicitor General says that the commission properly relegated this evidence to a secondary role because it is ordinarily a questionable reliability and because heavy reliance on it is inconsistent with the prophylactic test of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.442" offset="8789682">But here the threshold issue, the first issue is whether any market power was created by the merger and I suggest to the Court that post-merger evidence is surely relevant on that issue to see whether that power does or does not exist, really a different question than merger effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.844" offset="8871288">I know of no better way in the case of a completely untried and unknown power in an industry such as this to find out whether it exists and how effective it is then to look at the record of what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.828" offset="8927295">The government admits in its brief that evidence showing the impossibility of reciprocal buying would be relevant in a Section 7 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.286" offset="8965120">Surely, surely it must be true that where probability is the test, evidence showing the improbability of the market power existing must also be relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.052" offset="9016111">Now it's is no objection whatsoever I believe to say that post-acquisition evidence will not be available to the private treble damage litigants or that frequently the government whne it attacks the merger at the time of consummation will not have this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.523" offset="9078073">The point is I believe that the Court should use what they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.611" offset="9094374">If the evidence is available, why put on blinders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.065" offset="9108167">Where it's not available, then surely a judgment must be made on the basis of the facts that are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.455" offset="9141812">It's very fundamental mistake to call all of the evidence that Consolidated introduced in this case as being post-acquisition in the sense that it was somehow affected by the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.917" offset="9195624">There are two types of evidence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.192" offset="9204715">The first type shows the lack of actual reciprocal buying and it's the only kind of post-acquisition evidence that the Solicitor General has addressed himself to and I want to note here that he says that on this, he will rely on the DuPont case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.858" offset="9263334">I shall be happy to join issue with the Solicitor General on the application of the DuPont case. If you would had applied in DuPont, the theory that the Solicitor General argues here, you would have had to pay no attention to seventeen years or whatever it was of post-acquisition evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.754" offset="9330939">You could have simply said because DuPont owns ex-percent, that it was a very large percent of the General Motor stock, we will assume that a buy-sell relationship will flow from the stock ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.796" offset="9387154">Is when stock ownership a more binding tie than this reciprocal power that we are talking about, but the Court didn't do this?</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.152" offset="9416516">You looked at the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.794" offset="9423099">You saw what happened in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.719" offset="9434802">Did DuPont sell most of the requirements of General Motor's automotive finishes and fabrics and you found that DuPont swept into a commanding position as you said, simply because of this stock relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.373" offset="9497391">And all I ask for in this case is the kind of evidence that the Supreme Court relied on in the DuPont case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.731" offset="9530828">But now I should like to talk about the second type of evidence here, the type that the Solicitor General ignores.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.295" offset="9557159">This evidence deals with the conditions that exist in the food processing market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.291" offset="9581087">We put it into the record through the testimony by a large number of purchasing agents and other executives of food processing companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.170" offset="9616614">Now this evidence may it please the Court is entirely unrelated to the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.779" offset="9635109">It could have been testified to, in 1951 just as well as in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.979" offset="9667814">This kind of evidence I think is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.756" offset="9686936">I should like to take a moment if I may to put this case in a little context with the other Section 7 cases that have been decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.970" offset="9727791">In a progression of decisions ranging from Brown Shoe to Philadelphia National Bank, this Court has reached the conclusion that a significant, horizontal elimination of competition may create a rebuttable presumption of merger illegality, and you have shown what I believe to be an understandable impatience, with the details of market behavior evidence in that kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.342" offset="9833326">You've been looking obviously for clear cut test, guidelines that can help the businessmen, the bar and the enforcement agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.805" offset="9871151">Now you have before you the first so called conglomerate merger case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.818" offset="9891213">I do not wish to waste your time trying to define a conglomerate merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.557" offset="9910126">For convenience, I use it to mean only that it is not in the traditional, horizontal or vertical pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.863" offset="9939383">The only significance of this being a conglomerate merger in my opinion is that the test you have fashioned for automatic effect cases simply cannot be applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.134" offset="9984522">There is no automatic foreclosure effect from this kind of a merger as there is for a horizontal merger or a vertical merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.071" offset="10016183">Now the commentators and I too, find it very strange that the Federal Trade Commission is seeking to fashion a much more severe rule for these conglomerate mergers than you and it had done for horizontal and vertical mergers where the effects are much, much clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.455" offset="10093819">Two very well known economists, well known to this Court, Kaysen and Turner, writing in 1959 have proved to be remarkably prophetic about the test that should be fashioned for Section 7 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.600" offset="10154318">They advocated these severe tests, would have been called severe, that you have largely adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.507" offset="10177933">When Kaysen and Turner reached conglomerate mergers, they threw up their hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.123" offset="10196428">They said the standards of illegality seemed to be wholly illusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.212" offset="10216803">Indeed, Kaysen and Turner writing in 1959 said that they would go so far as to permit conglomerate acquisitions by everyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.818" offset="10263197">Now the government in its brief, but not the Solicitor General in his oral argument does come to grips with the problem in this case, and suggests a test for determining whether reciprocal buying will probably exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.617" offset="10318367">At page 28 of the Solicitor General's brief, it is said that there must be an examination into the extent of the acquiring company's buying power, and that this determines the effectiveness of the alleged leverage, which can be used to induce reciprocal buying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.112" offset="10392346">Now with this I agree, but the Court will look in vain in the Solicitor General's brief, will listen in vain to his argument, and will look in vain in the Commission's decision for any analysis whatsoever of the extent of Consolidated's buying power among the nation's thousands of food processors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.798" offset="10467161">That buying power can be tested in this record and it requires the examination of those conditions that I talked about a moment ago, what are they?</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.783" offset="10507076">To what extent do price, service and quality control purchasing decisions?</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.930" offset="10527660">To the extent that price, service and quality control obviously reciprocity affect is going to be diluted and I note that yesterday the Solicitor General made another significant omission, not contained in this brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.514" offset="10581995">He admitted that he is not arguing that Consolidated's buying power is so strong that it enables sales to be made without regard to price, service and quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.183" offset="10628702">There should be a inquiry as to whether there are other controlling factors, here they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.186" offset="10648660">Purchasing agents in this industry aren't free to just decide what they want to buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.245" offset="10668931">They have laboratories, quality control departments, production departments, all looking over their shoulders at every single decision, and you will see in the record that many of these purchasing agents said that their decisions were dictated by factors such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.595" offset="10730371">A third condition; do the food processors need Consolidated more than Consolidated needs the food processors?</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.037" offset="10764121">To the extent that, that food processors knows the Consolidated has to carry his product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.312" offset="10785228">For example, nationally advertised product like, Campbell Soup, he is not going to be responsive to any threat to withhold buying, because he knows it's an empty threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.467" offset="10829845">Now I am not going to say to the Court that any one of these conditions will make reciprocal buying impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.482" offset="10861923">I am going to say to you that all of them taken together inhibit, dilute and hold on any existence of reciprocal buying, where the issue is one probability all of these conditions are relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.034" offset="10928065">The Solicitor General yesterday said, what I thought was a very amazing thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.689" offset="10946664">He said that this buying power advantage maybe big or small.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.864" offset="10971429">He conceded that it's a fact, its existence may vary from industry to industry, and then he said and I quote, “Whether it's big or small is irrelevant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.806" offset="11015210">I seriously disagree with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.949" offset="11027749">If the buying power is small, how in the world can you reach the conclusion that there will probably be a substantial effect from the buying power?</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.219" offset="11068813">There must be an inquiry to see and the government says, so it is brief, although the Solicitor General did not in oral argument that the extent of the buying power is all important.</text>

            <text syncTime="2938.554" offset="11754162">Neither of these kinds of reciprocity can be said to be untried among food processors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.537" offset="11778090">I have pointed out that Silent has been there since 1951, if it exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.805" offset="11799197">The Solicitor General accurately points out that Consolidated executives did believe in reciprocity in the year shortly after the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.932" offset="11835664">I am sure they did, but they learned the hard way just like we have proved in this record that it simply won't work, and they were convinced also by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.475" offset="11881848">The belief of these executives in 1952-1953 stands on no better ground than the present day speculation or belief of the Federal Trade Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3129.878" offset="12519445">During the same period as the Solicitor General has mentioned and which we surely concede that is from 51-58, Consolidated's retail and wholesale business has expanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.830" offset="12563226">It has during this period, bought more food products from more food processors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.140" offset="12584542">You could choose almost any food processor of consequence in the United States and you would find that during this period of years, it sold more to Consolidated and bought more dehydrated onion and garlic.</text>

            <text syncTime="3172.602" offset="12690390">All it proves again is opportunity that is that there are food processors who, if they are going to engage in reciprocal buying can buy from Gentry because Consolidated is a customer, but whether they will or not, you can't get out of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.954" offset="12759771">Now Consolidated met the Commission's case here head-on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.438" offset="12777744">The government introduced evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.640" offset="12786521">They took up the cudgel on 70 companies in an effort to show that reciprocity worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.385" offset="12813479">Consolidated and they introduced this evidence by the way just by throwing in documents, showing hearsay and circumstantial evidence with respect to reciprocity context and reciprocity working.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.606" offset="12866351">We called witnesses from 50 companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.542" offset="12882129">The commission had not called one witness to testify that reciprocal buying existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.366" offset="12901460">We called witnesses from 51 companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.751" offset="12914939">This included all of the important customers among the government 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.466" offset="12933851">These companies that we had witnesses from bought more than 1/3rd of Gentry's dehydrated onion and garlic in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.680" offset="12966661">These are the witnesses who denied that they engaged in reciprocal buying and more importantly went on and testified in detail to the conditions controlling their purchasing decisions that would prevent reciprocal buying in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.717" offset="13030818">I won't distress to the Court lest somebody suggest it, that this evidence is not at all lied.</text>

            <text syncTime="3309.832" offset="13239275">I want to remind you though something that the Solicitor General didn't mention, when he referred to the examples of reciprocity effectiveness in these records.</text>

            <text syncTime="3328.101" offset="13312313">And each of those three examples was brought out on direct evidence by Counsel for Consolidated Foods Corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3347.052" offset="13388173">Three admitted it when I examined them and brought it out on direct examination, 48 denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.213" offset="13412833">Now what in the world can be the logical basis for accepting this evidence as to three companies, and rejecting it as to 48?</text>

            <text syncTime="3663.784" offset="14655112">I think it is very effective in demonstrating that after seven years or six full years Mr. Justine White, it shows that Gentry didn't do any better with the companies subjected to reciprocity than it did with companies with all of its customers and I think it is some evidence, I quickly agree with you even if it is not conclusive evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.507" offset="14737972">Now, I should like to spend a moment on the market share evidence, and first I want to make it abundantly clear to the Court, that I do not argue that post-merger decline in market shares proves that the merger did not affect competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.959" offset="14799830">That's not my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.520" offset="14805995">What I do say to you is that this evidence corroborates the other evidence we just looked at and all of the other evidence in this record showing that reciprocity is not affective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.370" offset="14849463">As Mr. Justice White so properly pointed out, you cannot pick up one bit of evidence in this case and say it's conclusive, but if you put all of it together, I think you have a very persuasive case at least overcoming whatever you want to choose to call the Commission's presumption or assumption or conjuncture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.650" offset="14926576">Now, with the market share data, if the Court wishes to look at it, the chart appears on page 29 of our brief, and you will see from this chart that Basic was the dominant onion producer in 1951 and it's still the dominant onion producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.223" offset="14996793">I should like to mention in this connection that the Solicitor General overstated the case when he said that Gentry was the dominant producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.562" offset="15030230">It has never been the dominant producer in this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.956" offset="15043814">Basic has always been the dominant producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.443" offset="15057711">Gentry's increased market share came as the Court will see, in onion, only after 1955, and that coincided with the time when it installed its new metal dehydration equipment that solved the wood splinter problem and gave it a quality edge over its competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.329" offset="15137228">Now, this is not speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.027" offset="15148095">The evidence would show that with just three companies, Lipton, Beech-Nut and Snow, Gentry sold over one million more pounds in 1957 than it did in 1954 to these three companies for this very reason; that is elimination of the wood splinters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.918" offset="15219670">That one million pounds alone accounts for, I believe about 24% of Gentry's total sales in 1954 and about 7% of total industry production.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.367" offset="15277453">In garlic, you see that the picture went the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.196" offset="15288738">Gentry went down by 12% from 51% to 39%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.630" offset="15310472">Now, the Solicitor General relies on this when he says that Gentry perhaps had inferior garlic quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.916" offset="15339624">Well, I want to ask this question, if this reciprocal buying was operating so powerfully in this market, why didn't it enable the garlic share to stay even if Gentry did have inferior quality?</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.400" offset="15393541">I submit to you that again, not conclusive, not controlling, but the cross-trends of these market shares, onion up, garlic down is some very persuasive evidence that ordinary competitive conditions were operating in this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.875" offset="15463445">I should like to mention again the fact that according to the government's arguments, since the day in 1951 when this merger took place, this supposedly awesome silent reciprocity power has been operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.460" offset="15521750">Food processors are supposed to automatically buy from their customer simply because they know which side of the bread the butter is on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.063" offset="15556232">Well, there are thousands of food processors in the United States, and if this power were as effective as the government says it is, you would think, I would think that they would have been literally knocking down Gentry's door to get out at its dehydrated onion and garlic and buy it in order to please Consolidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.880" offset="15623419">And whatever else the statistical evidence shows; it surely proves that food processors in the United States were not beating down Gentry's door to get their product.</text>

            <text syncTime="4233.209" offset="16932780">I should like to take one more example that I believe to be a very dramatic one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.066" offset="16956186">The Court is aware of the fact as I have mentioned before that there is this factor of consumer demand that requires companies like Consolidated to carry these products whether they want to or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.749" offset="16998922">I should like to take three of these; Hormel, the Birds Eye Division of General Foods, and Oscar Mayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.629" offset="17026508">I am sure you are all familiar with their products.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.802" offset="17039151">By 1958, Consolidated bought $764,000 worth of Birds Eye products.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.443" offset="17069767">It bought $500,000 worth of Oscar Mayer's products and it bought $320,000 worth from Hormel, and yet from 1951 to 1958 despite these very large purchases by Consolidated, Gentry has been spectacularly unsuccessful in selling to these companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4289.117" offset="17156389">In this total span of years, it sold 30,000 pounds of dehydrated onion and garlic during a period of time when its competitors sold over 800,000 pounds of dehydrated onion and garlic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.159" offset="17216575">Now the government argues that existing Gentry customers well be locked in by this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.691" offset="17242697">That is if the company buying from Gentry in 1951 is going to be locked to Gentry, because Consolidated is a customer, but let's just look at some examples, what is the proof of the pudding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.844" offset="17295360">Birds Eye and Armour where Consolidated from Armour bought one million dollars worth of their products.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.733" offset="17322841">They were Gentry customers in 1951, and yet both of these companies absolutely stopped buying from Gentry after 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.177" offset="17376653">If a large meat packer such as Swift should buy a meat market, this Court knows that the competitors of Swift are going to be foreclosed from selling to that meat market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.195" offset="17420748">If the meat market enters into a long-term requirements contract with Swift, you know that Swift's competitors can't sell to that meat market during the duration of the contract, and the same is true with tying agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.703" offset="17474769">If you have to buy A to get B, then you know that the competing sellers of A are going to be foreclosed for making that sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.679" offset="17514684">To use Judge Yankwitcher's very colorful language in a different context, all of these three vertical devices that I have mentioned build market foreclosure fences that are bull strong, horse high and hog tight.</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.971" offset="17575811">Not so, I suggest to this Court with reciprocal buying.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.815" offset="17591171">It's hard even to tell whether it exists in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.401" offset="17605590">It's duration is surely not fixed and its market foreclosure effect is hard to measure, and this is all the more reason I suggest to take a harder look at the market to see whether these foreclosure effects will probably exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="4420.039" offset="17680091">It ran on over a course of a couple of years Mr. Justice Harlan, because hearings were held in different cities over different periods of time, no depositions, all of the hearings with a before the hearing examiner of the Federal Trade Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.915" offset="17743621">Now if this Court should choose to assume that reciprocity is practiced in human relations and because it does, and because it may exist in some other industries, it will be prevalent and effective here, then as I have said before, there is precious little left for Consolidated to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="4455.391" offset="17821466">But if this Court recognizes that outside this record, there is a complete absence of empirical evidence anywhere about the sales inducing power of Consolidated among food processors then we have much to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="4470.721" offset="17882802">Now I ask this Court for no sweeping rule that would bless conglomerate mergers generally or reciprocity creating mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.676" offset="17918642">There will be time enough to consider such rules and principles when a proper case comes to this Court where effective reciprocity or its probability of existence in the future is proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4491.304" offset="17965140">There will be time enough for you to consider whether reciprocity can violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act or Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act when such a case comes before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4503.759" offset="18014981">What we do ask in the words of Mr. Justice Brandeis, is that there be here a factual showing of illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4513.446" offset="18053747">We ask only that this determination of legality or illegality be made on the record in this case, and that the test applied, the probability of substantial effect, not possibility of some effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.135" offset="18128457">If the court will pardon my presumptuousness, I am confident that if you apply the probability of substantial effect test rather than possibility of some affect as I believe the Commission did, you'll conclude that the Seventh Circuit properly overturned the decision of the Federal Trade Commission.</text>
