            <label>Mr. Sidney Dorfman</label>
            <text syncTime="170.583" offset="682318">The judge said at the court, “The government of course does not have to waive.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.636" offset="698514">I have always questioned the constitutionality of that provision of the Supreme Court ruling saying that the Government must consent to waiver of jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.350" offset="737384">The government is not entitled to a jury trial. The defendant did grant of a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.251" offset="756924">I always questioned it but I do not want to be the first judge in the United States to raise the point”.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.646" offset="802482">We took an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Ninth Circuit and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the conviction stating inter alia, that although the points that were raised concerning 23 (a) were not without some persuasive quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.439" offset="893701">They were not sufficiently persuasive apparently to overrule 23 (a) on that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.424" offset="925675">In oral argument before the Court of Appeals, Judge Barnes suggested that I bring the matter here to test the constitutionality of 23 (a) and after the judgment was affirmed, I petitioned this Honorable Court for certiorari which fortunately was granted and that is how we are here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.756" offset="1022955">The square issue before the Court is of course the validity of 23 (a) insofar as it purports to require the consent of the government before the defendant can waive a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.239" offset="1080947">Stated in other way, the question is whether or not the defendant has a constitutional right to be tried by the Court and not by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.577" offset="1118250">Stated still another way, the question and it's the same question is, does the United States of America have a constitutional right to a jury trial in a federal felony case.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.564" offset="1162240">Stated still another way and still the same question is can the government block a free and intelligent, involuntary choice on the part of the defendant and his counsel, particularly where the Court consents, can the Government block arbitrarily the defendant's insistence upon trial by the Court and upon waiver of the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.345" offset="1337365">I expect that I would be confronted with that question, Mr. Justice Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.553" offset="1354188">And the question I've imagined really is, “Am I consistent in my position that neither the judge nor the government has anything to say about the defendant's waiver of a jury trial?”</text>
            <text syncTime="350.386" offset="1401522">And I would say that my position is this, that except in the egregious case, where a defendant obviously is not making an intelligent choice or his counsel is not paying attention to his duties as counsel and something is going so badly that it would be an error and reversible, not to step in, then the Court has nothing to say about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.747" offset="1494936">The judge has nothing more to say about that choice than he has to say about the defendant's right to take the Fifth Amendment, than he has to say about the defendant's right to plead guilty or not guilty, than he has to say about any of the procedural steps except in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion to protect the defendant where he obviously is not protecting himself or his counsel is not protecting him.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney Dorfman</label>
            <text syncTime="432.991" offset="1731918">It has to be, yes, Your Honor, in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.427" offset="1753652">Now, how do we come to this position?</text>
            <text syncTime="441.616" offset="1766400">I think we come to it on historical basis, on a logical basis, on a basis of the construction of the words of the Constitution, and on the basis of everyday, ordinary, practical common sense and the administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.892" offset="1835468">As far as the historical basis is concerned, I think it's important to remember that although the history of the jury system is shrouded in mist, its origins are unknown, much of its development is still undetermined by whatever scholarship has turned its attention to this problem over centuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.610" offset="1914358">Still there are certain things that we do know about the jury system and one of the most important insofar as this case is concerned is that the jury system was a ‘Johnny come lately' that the jury system was an outgrowth of other systems, that the jury system was not the original mode of determining matters in judicial bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.710" offset="1998785">There were other techniques -- other ways of trying cases before the jury system developed, either by Germanic counsels of the elders in the local area or by trial by battle or by trial by ordeal or by trial by compurgators, trial by witnesses, all kinds and varieties of techniques.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sidney Dorfman</label>
            <text syncTime="525.620" offset="2102439">You do have to go way back, Your Honor, but I think I can also travel that distance right up to the date of the adoption of the Constitution and trace the course of it briefly because we have that much time and also scholarship is limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.908" offset="2159595">But, there were ancient ways of trying cases upon which the jury system was engrafted, so that there were rights that were accorded to people with respect to trials that were other than jury system rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.792" offset="2223125">And when the jury system finally came into play, it existed conterminously with these other techniques.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.154" offset="2252591">There was a right to be tried by a jury and there was a right to be tried by battle.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.181" offset="2280699">As a matter of fact, it wasn't until 1819, that the right to plead for trial by battle in England in murder and treason cases was abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.480" offset="2337855">In the case of Ashford versus Thornton, 1 Barnwell and Alderson 405, in 1819, it was decided by the High Court of England that the defendant who pleaded the right to be tried by battle in a felony murder case had pleaded a constitutional right, the parliament immediately abolished it within a few months but it was still on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.646" offset="2442553">And the point of this is to show the existence of alternative methods and that common law, we're all familiar with the doctrine of forcing a plea by paying a voir dire by some form of torture when the defendant refused to plead or as is more pertinent to the case before the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.216" offset="2528862">When the defendant refused to specify whether he wished to be tried by means of a jury or by means of trial by battle or by means of trial by ordeal, they piled iron weights on him until he either specified or died.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.178" offset="2592705">The importance of that doctrine -- the significance of it, however, is that the choice was the defendant's.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.613" offset="2626351">It wasn't the kings, it wasn't the crown -- the crown couldn't say to him, “I will tell you what your plea is going to be”.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.418" offset="2657593">The medieval mind required him to choose whether he wanted to be tried by ordeal or by a jury or by some other technique or method.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.748" offset="2702942">In Colonial days, and the lesson of the Colonial days, is of course taught to us by the brief of the government in United States versus Patton, Mr. Erwin N. Griswold, who is now Dean of the Harvard Law School was a counsel for the government in United States versus Patton and he wrote much of the brief dealing with the history of the jury system and the right to waive jury trials during the Colonial days.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.286" offset="2821120">In 20 Virginia Law Review in 1934, four years after the Patton case was decided, he elaborated on his brief in United States versus Patton and he took the position in the Patton case, which the government of course, urged very strongly, that there was a right to waive a trial by jury at the time of the adoption of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.241" offset="2912862">There weren't a great many cases in Colonial days but Mr. Griswold explains that on the basis of the paucity of the record, there weren't enough reported cases to give a clear picture of how prevalent the doctrine of the waiver of trial by jury really was.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.577" offset="2974302">But, it was his opinion and it was the government's argument to this Court in Patton versus the United States that the reason that Article III Section 2 Clause 3 of the United States Constitution does not mean what it says when it says that all trial shall be it by jury, is that at the time that Constitution was adopted, it was well known that there were alternative methods of trial and that the doctrine set forth in Article III Section 2 Clause 3 and in the Sixth Amendment of trial by jury was an optional doctrine, optional with the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.181" offset="3124663">Mr. Griswold and the brief for the government in Patton versus the United States cites the Pennsylvania case, in the year 1685, Proprietor versus Wilkins, it's in the Pennypacker's Colonial Cases at page 88, it's also cited in the report of Patton versus U.S. And that was a case in which the defendant was accused of a felony and he came before the Pennsylvania Court and he said that he wanted to be tried without a jury and that counsel for the government said, “This cannot be, you must have a jury trial” and the Court overruled him and held that it was permissible to waive trial by jury and jury was waived and he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.324" offset="3297280">But the point is established according to the government brief in Patton versus the United States that there was a right to waive trial by jury, so that if you review the history of this thing, you find that the jury system was an outgrowth of other modes of trial which have existed right past the acceptance or the adoption of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.150" offset="3376588">You find that the choice was the choice of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.717" offset="3390798">You find that at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, it was recognized in the cases that you could have an alternative method and if you then turn your attention to the Ninth Amendment of the United States Constitution, you'll find that the enumeration certain rights such as the right to a jury trial shall not derogate or diminish or lessen the other rights of the citizens that are not enumerated in the Constitution and I submit to this Court that one of the rights that the citizens have at the time of the adoption of the Constitution was the right to waive a jury, the right to be tried by the Court alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.194" offset="3544712">Now, we turn to the alternative problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.226" offset="3564878">What right does the government have to insist upon a trial by jury?</text>
            <text syncTime="896.021" offset="3584000">If you look at this thing historically, the battle has not yet been fought in which the government won the right to interpose between the crown and the crown's prosecutor and the crown's judge, a jury of 12 good men in troop.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.809" offset="3651187">There never was a situation in political history in which a king or a group of kings felt themselves threaten to such an extent by the powerful defendants who were indicted in criminal cases, that they need -- that the king needed a jury to protect the justice of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.538" offset="3726106">There never was such a trend in political history.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.690" offset="3734674">It was always exactly the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.921" offset="3743660">It was always the situation in which the weak defendant terrified that the power of the crown fought for and won the right to the interposition of the jury against the power of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.152" offset="3792562">Secondly, there isn't a word in the Constitution of the United States that grants or hints at or intimates that the government has a right to a trial by jury, not --</text>

            <text syncTime="1389.374" offset="5557394">The Amendment Nine as I read it, and I think I read it correctly, provides that the enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.915" offset="5631582">It is my position, based upon the research done by the government in Patton versus the United States that at a time of the adoption of the Constitution, people had alternative rights with respect to trial in felony cases, one right was to be tried by a jury, one right was to be tried by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.561" offset="5722175">When the Constitution pinpointed the right to be tried by a jury, they did not thereby, imply that you have lost your constitutional right to be tried by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.685" offset="5778704">The purpose of the Ninth Amendment is to preserve to the people their rights despite the failure of the Constitution to specify any particular right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.777" offset="6215053">The jury system is commonly described as a shield for the protection of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.285" offset="6249117">And I think that it's a truism to remark that many people fight better without shields in certain kinds of cases and it is unthinkable for the adversary to be able to prescribe the particular armament that a combatant is to wear in a particular controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.618" offset="6330410">There are cases as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out in Adams versus the United States ex rel. McCann in which it is better for the defendant to be able to waive a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.631" offset="6386521">There are cases such as issues involving great political problems such as accusations of communism, accusations of treason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.890" offset="6431556">There are problems that face the country and the Courts today in the south, where a defendant be he from the north or from the south may well feel that the choice of being tried by a jury or by a judge alone is vital to the kind of defense that he can make out for the government to be able to say that we shall have the right to veto your choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.421" offset="6537613">Under 23 (a), we have that right, to veto your choice, to me seems to be unthinkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.806" offset="6563213">It seems that the arguments in the government's or the Solicitor General's brief to the effect that it is sometimes important for the government to be able to choose a jury because of some difficulties it may be having or fancies it may have with the particular judge is an unthinkable kind of an argument for the government to urge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.318" offset="6649208">When the government speaks, when the government investigates, indicts, and prosecutes one of its citizens, it should speak like Joe from Olympus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.129" offset="6684421">It should speak with a voice that can be heard by a judge, a federal judge as well as by a jury for the government to say that there are cases when we need an edge, when we have to be able to choose as to whether or not there's going to be a judge or a jury seems unconscionable because the tremendous weight that the government already has, the tremendous edge that it already possesses is more than enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.377" offset="6785463">The investigative powers of the FBI, the batteries of lawyers, the almost unlimited funds with which to investigate and prosecute criminal cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2070.995" offset="8283951">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.089" offset="8296281">The question before the Court in this case is the constitutional validity of Rule 23 (a), not it's wisdom is a matter of policy, not the question of whether it should be changed for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.636" offset="8358452">This rule was adopted by the Court and accepted by Congress over the suggestion of some people that the order provide for a waiver of a jury trial merely on the face that was extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.290" offset="8425117">And it was adopted in its present form which says that trial shall be by jury unless jury is waived by the defendant with the approval of a Court and the consent of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.314" offset="8509231">So that it's not what's a good policy or what's a bad, but what is constitutionally required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.501" offset="8549982">In our view, the constitutional question is not the one which defendant has argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.625" offset="8574433">His claim is that he has a constitutional right to a trial by the Court because this Court decided in Patton that it was possible to have a valid tribunal, if a Constitution -- if a constitutional right to trial by jury was waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.276" offset="8661055">That was the issue in Patton phrased in terms of -- on the factual facts of 11 jurors, but the Court treated it more broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.829" offset="8699298">The question was whether a jury was part of the structure of the Court, so that no waiver was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.232" offset="8736914">And the fact that the Court decided that a District Court was a valid Court when in fact without the jury, doesn't mean that the Court recognized a constitutional right to waive a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.491" offset="8797936">What the Court said was that jury trial was primarily, primarily for the benefit of the defendant, and therefore he could waive it, and if all parties and the Court agreed, there was a validly set up court which could try the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.658" offset="8870557">But the fact that somebody has the right which he may waive, doesn't give him a constitutional right to insist on the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.719" offset="8910785">For instance, a defendant has the right to a public trial, a right which may be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.074" offset="8952268">This doesn't mean that he can insist on a private trial whenever he wants it so then nobody will ever hear about his crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="2283.512" offset="9133976">Then, we have a situation which we also refer to, which there is no citation but I think hardly needs citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.383" offset="9169502">A defendant has the right to waive confrontation of witnesses against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.810" offset="9199177">I don't think it would be seriously contended that this meant that he had a right to insist that the government proceed by stipulation before a jury and never call a live witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.497" offset="9261976">A defendant has the right to a speedy trial, a right which he sometimes can waive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.425" offset="9293636">I don't think this gives him the right to insist that the trial be put off for ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.065" offset="9328222">A defendant has the right to waive venue in the district of crime, this doesn't mean that he can insist that the trial be held in whatever district happens to suit his convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.665" offset="9402619">Defendant has the right to waive prosecution by indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.963" offset="9419755">This doesn't mean that he can insist that the government go ahead by information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.977" offset="9443892">I think one can go to practically every one of the guarantees of the Sixth Amendment which are for the benefit of the defendant and show that the right to waive that under certain circumstances is not a right to insist on the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.175" offset="9512647">Moreover I point out that the right to regulate the conditions under which a defendant may waive the benefit of one of the constitutional guarantees has always been deemed subject to regulation by Congress or the Court through rule making or decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.831" offset="9627272">For example, many states and in effect the federal government provide that a jury trial cannot be waived in the death case, because under almost all federal capital crimes, the death penalty can be assessed only by the jury, if there were a constitutional right to waive the jury trial, of course, those would be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.132" offset="9740434">Even in lesser degrees, the rules do regulate the right to waive constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.987" offset="9775856">For instance, Rule 7 of the present rules provides that prosecution must be indictment, must be by indictment in the death case and this Court quite recently in the Smith case gave out what the government regarded as a rather expansive reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.897" offset="9863523">Rule 20 provides that a prosecution may waive -- that a defendant may waive the right to be tried in the district where the crime is committed and plead guilty in the district where he is arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.675" offset="9946697">But the rule provides that, that must have the consent of the government, and as far as I know that's never been questioned as a proper method of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.025" offset="10016078">And that these illustrations, it seems to me answer the suggestion which has been made in the brief of (Inaudible), that its beyond the rule making power of this Court to set forth the conditions for a waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.221" offset="10088803">I think these rules show that conditions for a waiver had been deemed part of the rule making power.</text>

            <text syncTime="2882.707" offset="11530762">Oh, which is the statement, but it was an indication of the fact that the right to waive doesn't stem from the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.081" offset="11592307">If there is no constitutional right to waive, then the question comes down to the reasonableness of the requirement of the rule that a waiver of a jury trial must be with the consent of the government and the approval of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.444" offset="11685721">And I point out again, because the question is power and not policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.090" offset="11720307">There may be, I presume there are, considerations both ways as to whether the government should have a right to insist on a jury trial where a defendant wants to waive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.439" offset="11785718">But so long as there are reasonable considerations which support the policy which was deliberately adapted in the present rule, it seems to me the validity of the rule must be upheld and the change if it comes, to come in the revision of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.594" offset="11886341">Now it seems to me there are two quite fundamental concepts of our government which support the constitutional validity of the present rule and one is the importance which our system attaches to jury trial particularly in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.477" offset="11985816">I take it is the fundamental philosophy that underlies that -- that 12 men or really 13, because after all the judge is never out of the picture in a jury case, are better able to determine guilt than one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.421" offset="12097620">And that on some issues particularly issues of morality and intent that judgment of laymen may sometimes be better than the judgment of a legally trained mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.160" offset="12168568">There's also another consideration which I think is not given enough weight in a lot of literature on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.712" offset="12218828">If you go through our whole system of government, it reflects the philosophy that unchecked power in one branch of the government or in one person is not a good thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.938" offset="12279745">And one of the very few examples really in our judicial system of the un-reviewable power of one man is a power which a judge has in a criminal case and which was recently reaffirmed by this Court in the (Inaudible) case, now that power becomes even greater when the judge is not only the presiding judge at the criminal trial, but is the finder of fact as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.320" offset="12413179">And it is some check, it isn't much of a check but it is some check, for the government to be able to say, "Now, we think this is the kind of case where we have a right, we who must do justice have a right to insist on the constitutionally preferred method, one that our system accepts as the best method for finding facts, and that is a trial by jury", at least the Congress and this Court in the rule (Inaudible) could think so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3245.575" offset="12982230">All I can say about that kind of a case and I can't commit the government to what may come up that at least, if a rule is going to be held invalid, it must be on some such personalized special basis, that is that the rule is run broadly and we have the right to assume that the rule is valid on the broad considerations, I have been talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.230" offset="13092885">If in a particular case, when it comes, there is something peculiar about the circumstances as to that case that makes the rule invalid as so applied, we can deal with that when it comes -- all I can say is that with the case with which I am dealing, there is absolutely nothing which would support that kind of view, because the charge here which is essentially a charge on the simple mind, is a question of playing on the hopes of amateur song writers that, “Oh, if somebody will just hear this song, they'll have a great big hit”, and that sort of things and it's very cleverly worded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.407" offset="13289535">If you look at it carefully as a contract, nobody promises anything, we have the record available for motion picture rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.735" offset="13322867">Now the judge says, “That means exactly what it says, “It's available”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.876" offset="13351497">A jury looking at that whole picture is better able to judge the effect of this whole lure what (Inaudible) called the glittering promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.616" offset="13398413">This is a kind of case in which juries have to be a better judge than a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.288" offset="13425058">I don't mean to imply we didn't have -- that the judge would have been unfair, I am merely saying this is a kind of case, this kind of simple fraud, not complicated, simple, where a jury is assumption of our system and I think a valid one, that a cross section of the community is better able to determine intent to defraud and the ability to do fraud than is the legally trained mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.188" offset="13536653">But I've repeated again that this isn't a good policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.813" offset="13551177">It can be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.055" offset="13560163">The fact is that it was deliberately adopted by this Court and it seems to me it cannot be held unconstitutional, unless it could be shown that it has no basis in reason at all and it seems to me it clearly does have a basis in reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.355" offset="13649398">I point out also that Congress has historically recognized that the government is a party to a criminal action, that it has some of the rights of a party, and that the government as a party to a criminal action has an interest in the triar of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.259" offset="13736960">Since 1855, Congress has given the government the right of peremptory challenge, the same as the right of a defendant, peremptory challenge a juror.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.792" offset="13791086">I presume on the basis that the government ought to have the same righteous dissent to see that the case was fairly tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.243" offset="13832882">And interestingly enough, the number of government challenges has gone up over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.961" offset="13863811">Well, I think Congress and the Court has the constitutional power to say that the government has an interest in seeing that the jury as a whole is not in effect peremptorily challenged by eliminating the jury entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.344" offset="13945313">And so it seems to me that considering the place that a jury trial occupies in our jurisprudence, and considering the fact that the government does have an interest that its case be fairly tried, it cannot be said that this Court was without power to decide, that if a constitutionally established method of trial of a criminal case is to be waived, the waiver must be consent of the government as well as the approval of the Court.</text>
