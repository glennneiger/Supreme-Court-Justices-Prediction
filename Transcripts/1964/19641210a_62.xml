            <text syncTime="54.506" offset="217966">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.116" offset="232385">I should like to discuss in this Federal Trade Commission case, first, the merits, returning only if there is time to the question of compliance with the mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.890" offset="271464">That will very much simplify the statement of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.978" offset="287869">Late in 1959, over five years ago, the respondents created and disseminated over network television, three commercials for Colgate-Palmolive's product Rapid Shave.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.482" offset="341891">Each of them showed what the respondents called a “sandpaper test” which again in the respondent's words was said to prove the super-moisturizing power of Rapid Shave.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.137" offset="392464">The test showed someone spreading lather on a rather coarse piece of sandpaper and then immediately shaving a clean path through the lather and the sand.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.782" offset="435096">After viewing the commercials, the Commission found specifically that each represented that buyers were being given visual experimental proof of the truth of the words the seller were saying, the truth of the seller's claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.399" offset="497580">In fact, the sandpaper test was not a test at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.013" offset="508029">The respondents had sprinkled sand on the piece of plexiglass which had some mildly adhesive liquid spread over it and shaved a clean path through the loose sand.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.844" offset="559334">A rather colorful set of test conducted before the hearing examiner, proved conclusively that no comparable piece of sandpaper could be shaved in seconds, minutes or even after an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.890" offset="615549">Finally, they came up with a piece of sandpaper that seemed to be roughly comparable, it was shaved after 80 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.178" offset="644702">On the basis of these facts, the Commission found that respondents had engaged in two misrepresentations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1534.108" offset="6136372">The major source, the most -- the most important source is that sellers have the greatest interest in making their product look attractive, that's how you sell it and they will exaggerate and they will pop within the realm of what they regard as substantially true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.458" offset="6197812">Buyers have the greatest interest in knowing just what the product can do, not receiving a puffed ad within the realm of what the seller regards -- within the limits that the seller regards as substantially true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.843" offset="6247340">We know of only one way that a seller can tell buyers that he is receiving the real thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.660" offset="6270537">Only one way he can say this is a no puffing ad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.570" offset="6282240">This is an ad better than one that the Commission will check three years from now and find out if it -- if they regard it as material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.090" offset="6312333">This is an ad -- only one way they can say, “Here's an ad that you can judge for yourself if the variations are material and here's an ad where you don't have to wait three years.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.115" offset="6348382">And that is for the seller to say, “We will show you on television the very product, doing the very thing we can claim for it -- we claim for it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.198" offset="6384744">And that's what they do in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.542" offset="6394149">This avenue of communication, the only possibility of sellers giving buyers the specific truth and of eliminating the uncertainty that pervades advertising, the uncertainty of exaggeration is eliminated if the Commission cannot forbid misrepresentations that you're furnishing proof when you're not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.280" offset="6481084">Now that's why I said, I didn't know -- I don't know whether the product can do it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.766" offset="6499056">In some cases, the seller will guess wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.700" offset="6506789">I'm just assuming that he's going to use his best judgment to keep within the limits of substantial truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.819" offset="6527269">In some cases, you'll guess wrong and others you won't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.777" offset="6551092">In all cases, there will be a variation and the buyer will think he's seeing the very thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.948" offset="6571781">I want -- for two minutes to address myself to what I regard as the respondent's answer to our contention that there is no justification from falsely representing that you're giving proof when you're not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.039" offset="6632072">The seller seems to say that when they put a test on television, they're not saying that they're proving the truth of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.553" offset="6658194">They're simply saying, here's a test that we've done and you can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.357" offset="6677420">To that we have three answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.151" offset="6688601">First, the Commission has found otherwise after viewing the commercials and the Commission's judgment on the nature of misrepresentations is entitled to the greatest deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.979" offset="6727889">Second and more important, I think the Commission was plainly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.861" offset="6747429">When a seller says to a buyer, “I'll prove the truth of my claims,” he says “I'll give you independent evidence of the honesty and accuracy of what I'm saying.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.135" offset="6784522">That's what proof mean for anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.194" offset="6792673">It means giving evidence that will compel belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.569" offset="6802181">That's what Webster says, it's especially true in sellers and buyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.073" offset="6820258">If I -- and this is what they said in this case, we will give you evidence to prove the truth of our claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.681" offset="6838648">If I may use two analogies, if I were to say to this Court, I can kick a football 50 yards and I'll prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.560" offset="6870204">And then I showed a movie of a football being kicked 50 yards, I think every justice on this Court would believe that he was seeing me kick the football 50 yards, not an accurate portrayal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.026" offset="6912104">Well the claim has a certain implausibility about it, but not an accurate portrayal of the claim using substitutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.268" offset="6945019">If a seller says -- if a seller of a cleaning fluid says that his claim can remove heavy grease stains immediately and he will prove it to the buyer and then shows him a movie showing grease -- what appears to be grease stains removed by what appears to be the same product, buyers believe that they're seeing the very thing done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.207" offset="7016803">They believe they are receiving something to -- on which they can rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.265" offset="7036970">That's what proof is, some independent confirmation of the truth of their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.148" offset="7060584">Finally, the Commission's order is limited to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.755" offset="7078975">The Commission's order doesn't reach as the respondents would suggest every use of mock-ups and test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.244" offset="7100918">It forbids a representation that tests furnish actual proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.672" offset="7126622">And I'll close by saying, it doesn't forbid anything about mock-ups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.449" offset="7141773">Mock-ups can be eliminated from the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.493" offset="7149923">The Commission would have no objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.269" offset="7157029">I'll save the rest of my time for rebuttal Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1896.141" offset="7584496">My difficulty is what his statement, of what the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.550" offset="7610096">There was during the hearing before the examiner, attention given primarily to the question of how long you had to soak the sandpaper before you could shave it, and there was expert evidence and the parties concentrated on the question whether the representation was true or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.609" offset="7702361">That was the focus and the focal point of the hearing before the examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.137" offset="7728483">The Colgate counsel at that time put great effort into proving and we think, made a reasonably good record that the word soak used in the commercial, which Your Honor will find at pages 8 and 10 -- through 10 I believe of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.341" offset="7809358">At page 10, there is a description of this commercial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.799" offset="7831092">Now in this commercial, the announcer said with respect to the sandpaper test, it was apply soak and often a stroke.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.966" offset="7895771">It was held below that, that was a misrepresentation, because the soaking could not be done as quickly as the ad implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.709" offset="7934746">And we do not here challenge that aspect of the finding, because that is not the question before Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2029.614" offset="8118439">What I am suggesting to Your Honor is that there is nothing in the record before you with respect to the use of mock-ups in television, their need, their justification, the public awareness of them or anything of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.071" offset="8184268">What we had here was the Commission coming up with a pet theory of law, which it dragged into this case by the heels on the basis that the record limited only to this sandpaper commercial ad, and what the Commission has done by its order, contrary to what the government suggests, is to say and this is the proposition before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.163" offset="8280607">When it is necessary in a television or other commercial or advertisement to use a substitute in order to convey the truth, you may not use the substitute, in order to convey the truth unless you tell the viewer that you are using a substitute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2479.468" offset="9917858">Your Honors will recall that, that rule is designed to prevent the presentation to this Court in argument of questions which differ in substance from the question presented in the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.388" offset="9989538">Now whether or not there's a violation by the government of Rule 40, I don't press, but I would like to call your attention, the very curious and very revealing, because it's revealing the lack of clarity with which the government has approached this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.487" offset="10065920">If Your Honor will look at the question presented in the petition at page 2, it reads as follows, whether the Federal Trade Commission may prohibit as an unfair or deceptive trade practice, the representation that a test, experiment or similar demonstration shown on television provides the viewer with visual proof of a product claim (which may itself be true) when the test is a sham which proves nothing because of the undisclosed use of a mock-up in the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.624" offset="10230491">Now, when the government comes to present this question in its brief, the furious and revealing omission is that they takeout the matter in the parenthesis which was in the question stated in the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.156" offset="10292558">The heart of the problem is that the claim made is true by definition before Your Honors today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2585.864" offset="10343445">Curiously enough, the government sought to duck the question in its brief and they're still ducking it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.177" offset="10364656">The only rational basis we submit upon which the Federal Trade Commission or the courts should view advertisements is whether the message communicates the truth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2616.556" offset="10466220">Here by definition the viewer on the television screen would see the representation of a sandpaper test identical with what he would see if he went to the studio and they used real sandpaper and everything by hypothesis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.322" offset="10537273">And the question before you is assumed to be absolutely true and correct, the product claim, everything is correct except for one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.852" offset="10571337">We have to use plastic with sand on it rather than sandpaper because as the finding shows, sandpaper won't be photographed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.625" offset="10606446">Now if the Commission is going to get into the business of regulating advertising by telling advertisers how to tell the truth rather than stopping them from lying, we're going to have the Commission getting into a business where the hand of the government can create great havoc.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.948" offset="10679693">The need for mock-ups in this industry which is a vital and growing industry, the nature of the changes in the technology of broadcasting, the justification whether it be technical or economic for this or that device in broadcasting, the matter is better left I think to the industry rather than by government regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2844.258" offset="11376953">Your Honors will see that the Commission was still apprehensive as to whether they'd thought through or explained that position adequately and then in the second paragraph of that footnote, the Commission said “Thus even if it be assumed in the instant case that Rapid Shave can in fact shave sandpaper precisely as shown in the commercials and that a mock-up was used only because real sandpaper cannot faithfully by reproduced on television, it misses the point to say that the commercials were therefore free from falsehood.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2908.455" offset="11633789">They go on to say that the misrepresentation would not have been any worse if there had been an explicit statement that it was real sandpaper was being used.</text>
