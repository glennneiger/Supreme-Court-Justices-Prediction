            <label>Mr. Howard H. Moldenhauer</label>
            <text syncTime="41.528" offset="166034">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.702" offset="178782">The question to be argued today in this matter is whether this Court is to take jurisdiction of an original action by the State of Nebraska against the State of Iowa to construe and enforce the Iowa and Nebraska boundary compact of 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.993" offset="243879">The -- a motion for leave to file a bill of complaint has been filed with this Court to which was attached to the complaint.Iowa has indicated opposition to this motion on briefs on file.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.861" offset="291422">In 1892, this Court decided that the Missouri River Boundary between Iowa and Nebraska was the middle of the main channel of the Missouri River.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.421" offset="329665">And that in spite of the rapidity of the changes of the Missouri River caused by the velocity of the current that the normal principles of the law of accretion and avulsion applied to the Missouri and that this boundary move where the changes of the channel were gradual or imperceptible by the process known as accretion or reliction but that where the river suddenly abandoned its bank and sought a new bed by the process known as avulsion, the boundary did not move but remained in the abandoned channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.399" offset="433528">During the years that followed that decision of this Court, there were many changes, natural changes in the Missouri River and the flooding was very great.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.599" offset="466338">So in the 1930s, the United States Army Corps of Engineers embarked upon a program with channel stabilization.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.874" offset="491416">And they commenced to divert the river into a new and stabilized channel which has been referred to as a design channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.380" offset="517433">They did this by the construction of dikes and revetments and by dredging operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.504" offset="537913">Well, as a result of all these natural changes, as a result of the action by the Corps of Engineers much land which had been in the State of Nebraska found itself placed on the easterly or Iowa side of the river, much land which had been in the State of Iowa found itself placed on the westerly or the Nebraska side of the Missouri River and there was a great deal of uncertainty and friction which resulted as to where this land was.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.391" offset="633522">So because of this uncertainty and this friction, the states in the early 1940s entered into the negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.829" offset="659226">And in 1943, both states entered into the Iowa-Nebraska Boundary Compact which was duly ratified by the Congress of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.615" offset="694439">And this compact did several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.272" offset="701022">After accepting an area known as Carter Lake, Iowa by metes and bounds description which was left in Nebraska by avulsion in 1877, the Compact set the new line between Iowa and Nebraska and defined it as the center line of the proposed stabilized channel of the Missouri River as established by maps on file with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in which maps were then subsequently filed with the Secretary's of the State of the two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.882" offset="807497">And the Compact went on and it provided that Iowa ceded and relinquish jurisdiction of all lands now in Iowa but lying westerly of said boundary line to Nebraska and Nebraska ceded jurisdiction over all lands on the other side of the river to the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.143" offset="884506">At that time, when they determined this new line, the states didn't take any action to specifically identify the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.102" offset="912405">In fact, we've been informed that it was too expensive of a job at that time and they didn't want to make all these difficult determinations which couldn't be made without litigation and without a great deal of expenditure funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.716" offset="958798">They also didn't provide any procedure for describing land which had been placed -- which had been in one state and was thereby ceded to the other by the different metes and bounds descriptions of the different regions or range lines which were applicable to land in that other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.346" offset="1013342">The Compact didn't stop there with just setting a line.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.928" offset="1027657">It continued and this is cited at pages 26 and 30 of our complaint, to provide the titles, mortgages, and other liens good in Nebraska, shall be good in Iowa as to any lands which Nebraska may cede to Iowa in any pending suits or actions which concerns said lands maybe prosecuted to final judgment in Nebraska and such judgment shall be accorded full force in fact in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.288" offset="1125146">The Compact went one step further and provided for the collection of taxes on lands which had been ceded to the other state by the original ceding state for the year of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.604" offset="1162344">And then it went on and provided a five-year limitation and stated that all liens or other rights accrued or accruing as aforesaid in this tax provision shall be claimed or asserted within five years or be forever barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.570" offset="1214276">In fact as it turned out the channel wasn't stabilized and everyone thought it was at that time, the Corps of Engineers changed its plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.327" offset="1245205">The channel or river broke through in many places.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.634" offset="1254504">Some of the maps were destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.305" offset="1261192">But for many years, it appeared that this Compact had solved the boundary problems between Iowa and Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.890" offset="1287523">And Nebraska citizens continued in their peaceful possession of this land, they improved it, they cleared it.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.596" offset="1306331">And because of the stabilization of the river, the land which was really rich bottom land became highly productive farmland.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.636" offset="1330469">This period of peace and tranquility which lasted until the early 60s was suddenly broken by announcement by the State Conservation Commission of the State of Iowa that the state was planning to attempt to acquire a great deal of land -- title to potential recreational sites along the Missouri River.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.695" offset="1398700">On January 1 of 1961, the Conservation Commission published a document known as Part 1 of the Missouri River Planning Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.321" offset="1425241">And this listed approximately 25 areas which contained -- or 15,000 acres of land somewhere on the Iowa side of the river as it presently exist somewhere on the Nebraska side.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.154" offset="1472575">And the com -- the planning report indicated that there maybe some more changes because we're not quite sure in some areas what the Corps of Engineers is going to do and their action may affect whether or not we think we can acquire some more land.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.216" offset="1520849">The theory which Iowa seem to be following was the Iowa Rule of Law, of common law at least, that the state owns title to the beds of navigable streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.279" offset="1557107">And this had been followed by the Iowa Supreme Court for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.245" offset="1572885">This differs from the Nebraska Law and that in Nebraska the beds of navigable streams belong to the riparian owners but subject to the easement of public navigation in the streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.162" offset="1616562">The State of Iowa then proceeded to implement this program by filing some lawsuits against some of these landowners which had owned Nebraska land and had been Nebraska residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.205" offset="1660761">And this caused a great deal of concern to the State of Nebraska because Nebraska felt that it had by the Compact placed these lands within the jurisdiction of Iowa by entering into a new boundary line.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.405" offset="1705587">But in doing so, it didn't do this unequivocally, it extracted certain guarantees from the State of Iowa, guarantees which were essential to the existence of this Compact.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.666" offset="1802658">I think it's our position that this created an artificial line but it is a little difficult to tell in many places where this line is because the maps which were on file and referred to had a scale of one inch equals to 2640 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.963" offset="1863784">The Corps of Engineers at that same time had many maps which were the same as the alluvial plain maps but with a much larger scale, an inch equals 400 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.857" offset="1899416">We've been informed since that time that many of these one inch equals 400 foot maps have been destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.610" offset="1918433">And these were maps which surveyors used as a practical matter because we've been informed that in many places where these maps were destroyed is impossible under the original maps that laid the boundary out on the ground as it exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.299" offset="1969110">So we have a description of a boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.860" offset="1975380">Now then there were many river changes since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.558" offset="1986142">The river broke out of its bank and again, there's never been any definitive decision which would define in those places where this boundary is at the present time.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.085" offset="2468258">Your Honor, it is our contention that when we entered into this Compact, we didn't unequivocally cede the land to the State of Iowa or place it in Iowa's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.321" offset="2509218">We only did so subject to some safeguards which were placed in the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.619" offset="2534400">And our theory really is that this Compact is a contract between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.130" offset="2552477">And as such it's binding on the states not just their judiciary but it's binding on the states themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.815" offset="2571180">And that the State of Iowa by instituting these quiet actions is not recognizing these titles to this land which is ceded.</text>

            <text syncTime="653.127" offset="2612454">And we don't think that when two states enter in an agreement such as a compact, we think that one state should be able to enforce the terms of that compact, whatever they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.820" offset="2647249">This matter seemed to be of great interest to the states or they wouldn't have put in provisions which were designed to settle the controversy at least as between the states and landowners along the river and design to settle the boundary.</text>

            <text syncTime="695.987" offset="2783922">And that Iowa by taking that position is saying you have to try your title in our courts with us, the state as a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.075" offset="2816209">And we think that because of the result of that situation and the unfairness which seems to result from that situation that we should be able to have the determination here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1591.509" offset="6365936">We've got other boundary questions with Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.637" offset="6374504">There has been a talk about the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.190" offset="6384744">We wonder how we can enter into a Compact if we're merely creating a situation whereby some individual is going to have his title attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.299" offset="6413166">And so we think that the purpose of the Compact requirement in the constitution would be defeated if a state can't enforce a compact which is entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.743" offset="6466873">This is really the crux of our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.267" offset="6480980">These rights arise out of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.333" offset="6493309">They're not independent situations which existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.727" offset="6534896">And of course the alternative is that what we decide we couldn't intervene in the Iowa suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.985" offset="6551928">We're faced with that situation and cases were pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.976" offset="6563840">We didn't think it's proper to subject to the state to the jurisdiction of the Iowa courts as to the meaning of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.882" offset="6587455">This Court has often held that compact shouldn't be subject to the unilateral construction by one court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.355" offset="6609398">And Iowa was construing it their way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.106" offset="6616398">We don't have anything to say about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.922" offset="6627683">We don't have any -- the Iowa Attorney General's office has taken the position and the State of Iowa consequently in these cases that the law of Nebraska is irrelevant immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.319" offset="6661224">It doesn't have any bearing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.019" offset="6668016">And we don't see how you can have any decision as to the river itself without having -- without taking into account what the Compact does, because Iowa's argument leads to one other sort of absurd result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.286" offset="6713051">Well first, there's one another unfairness I'd like to mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.938" offset="6723709">And that is that Iowa has waited 20 years before they've done anything about the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.885" offset="6747533">And we think of course that it -- that this constitutes a course of conduct which is consistent with Nebraska's contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.233" offset="6768849">Witnesses have died during this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.817" offset="6775223">Lands have been cleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.755" offset="6778984">Landmarks have been destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.006" offset="6784000">Trees have been removed which might indicate when this land was formed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.632" offset="6798524">And this Court in previous cases considering boundary has recognized that the operation of time can operate to a tremendous prejudice to the individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.489" offset="6833946">And here again, the only person who is prejudice is the landowner because the state is sitting there saying, “We are a sovereign”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.530" offset="6858083">They're saying that you can't apply adverse possession against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.574" offset="6874279">We're not subject to the normal doctrines of latches or estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.842" offset="6887340">And therefore, the state can wait 20 years until everybody dies and bring their suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.802" offset="6907193">We think that situation isn't just.</text>

            <text syncTime="2310.972" offset="9243794">We think the great object when it can be distinctively perceived ought not to be defeated by those technical perplexities which sometimes influence contracts between individuals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2335.919" offset="9343582">And we contend what Iowa's doing is creating controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.725" offset="9362808">It also in the -- it creates a completely impossible situation as to what is the law in the present Missouri River because when this river moves, does Iowa then require a new title to a new bed, there are areas where the river was completely in Nebraska at the time of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.696" offset="9418710">Iowa says, these titles are good in Nebraska and will be good in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.522" offset="9434070">They make a new boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.729" offset="9438877">I would suppose that that would mean that Iowa would have to recognize that the Nebraska riparian owner own the entire bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.261" offset="9464999">But nowhere has Iowa ever admitted that in any of the cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2853.995" offset="11415928">There was a great distinction in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.165" offset="11428571">At that time, the State of Nebraska law was the -- identical to the law of Iowa in 1906.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.087" offset="11460336">They subsequently changed their law or at least clarified it to the extent that it invested ownership in the riparian owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.231" offset="11496908">Nebraska versus Iowa and that former case likewise was different in the respect that there was no compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.328" offset="11521254">There was a question of course both states then followed the rule of the thalweg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.125" offset="11540480">The boundary line was established as the thalweg of the river, the deepest part of the main channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.070" offset="11564199">The question of an oxbow which was broken off placing a town on this Carter Lake was placed on the Nebraska side leaving intact this same identifiable piece of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.507" offset="11613936">And the channel of the Missouri River remained on the Iowa side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.584" offset="11630237">And this Court held that because of the fact of the avulsion that the boundary line between the states did not changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.278" offset="11661061">And accordingly, it remained in this old oxbow on the Nebraska side while the main channel of the river ran entirely within the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.736" offset="11702857">This oxbow of course dried up, thus, we have a situation where the town of Carter Lake, Iowa is entirely on the Nebraska side and has been for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.981" offset="11747892">So this is an obvious situation where the river, the Missouri River runs entirely through the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.259" offset="11781016">The State of Nebraska has no interest or ownership whatsoever along those lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.595" offset="11822289">The plaintiff admits in paragraph 10, page 11 of his motion, that the State of Nebraska has no ownership as such in the lands and controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.854" offset="11871399">And we feel that in Arkansas versus Texas where in this Court, in allowing the motion to file a bill of complaint, stated at page 82 of 98 law edition, the contention that the controversy is between two states is challenged on the ground that the injured party is the University of Arkansas which does not stand in the shoes of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.478" offset="11977874">Arkansas must of course, represent an interest of her own and not merely that of her citizens or corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.101" offset="12012356">The Court went on to find that the particular university was an instrumentality of the state and thus concluded that there was and actually in actuality a true controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.284" offset="12061048">But this Court, in recognizing and allowing the motion and in recognizing that a true controversy did in fact exist and pointed out the conversed, that Arkansas as Nebraska must in this case, represent an interest of her own and not merely that of her citizens as in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.488" offset="12149864">The State of Nebraska has pointed out that the Iowa-Nebraska boundary was formerly before this Court in Nebraska versus Iowa which I have previously discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.116" offset="12208379">Also, in that particular case which was before the Court, the question of jurisdiction was not raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.496" offset="12233979">But we respectfully submit that the State of Nebraska has failed to establish that this suit is anything but one instituted on behalf of its own citizens and accordingly we feel jurisdiction shouldn't be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.351" offset="12289358">We further submit that a state that is asking permission of this Court to prevent the enforcement and exercise of the duties of another state, they must allege in the complaint offered for filing facts that are clearly sufficient to call for a decree in its favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.046" offset="12364173">This Court's decisions definitely established that not every matter of submission -- sufficient moment to warrant resort to equity by one person against another who would justify an interference by this Court with the action of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.249" offset="12428957">In Missouri versus Illinois, this Court upon rule -- overruling a demurrer discussed primarily the jurisdiction of the Court and stated that 200 U.S., page 578, the constitution extends the judicial power of the United States to controversies between two or more states and between a state and citizens of another state and gives this Court original jurisdiction in cases in which a state shall be a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.016" offset="12540029">Therefore, if one state raises a controversy with another, this Court must determine whether there is any principle of law and if any, what on which the plaintiff can recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.862" offset="12587363">But the fact that this Court must decide does not mean of course, that it takes the place of a legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.861" offset="12611396">Some principles, it must have power to declare.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.457" offset="12625816">For instance, when there a dispute arises about boundaries, this Court must determine the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.765" offset="12654968">And in doing so, must be governed by rules explicitly or implicitly recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.215" offset="12680777">We submit that in accord with this particular holding, that there is no line to determine that the line was determined by the Compact between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.400" offset="12725499">The Compact of 1943 established the jurisdictional boundary between the State of Nebraska and the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.673" offset="12750681">It is -- has been and can be accurately located by surveyors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.771" offset="12771056">Its self-evident, it's actually a matter that if this Court were to make a judicial determination as to where the boundary is or if the legislature is to do it, it necessarily requires the employment of a surveyor to go out and physically locate the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.105" offset="12848379">Thus the boundary having been established in 1943 between the State of Nebraska and the State of Iowa by compact placing it in the center of the design channel, the boundary is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.551" offset="12898116">It only must be physically located.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.739" offset="12906893">This Court can do nothing more to determine the location of that line.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mr. Attorney General</label>
            <text syncTime="3704.915" offset="14819579">I think that if you examine their complaint in the entirety as to certain things that I shall attempt to point out at this point, that perhaps I can show why we'll -- we feel that it's deficient on its face because of the inconsistencies and some of the absences that they have submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.912" offset="14907559">First of all, in paragraph 14, page 14 of the plaintiff's motion, the plaintiff of State of Nebraska alleges “approximately the westerly 50 feet of the land described in the second amendment to plaintiff's petition in the State of Iowa versus Babbitt marked Exhibit H is presently in the State of Nebraska and it's west of the center line of the proposed stabilized channel of the Missouri River as established by the alluvial planes maps, referred to in the Iowa-Nebraska Boundary Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.053" offset="15056144">This allegation has succeeded by paragraph 20, page 19 of the plaintiff's motion which provides impertinent part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.962" offset="15095745">The problem is compounded by the fact that the alluvial plane maps referred to in the Iowa-Nebraska Boundary Compact are of too small a scale, (one inch equals 2640 feet) and do not contain sufficient detail for a surveyor to accurately locate the boundary on the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.907" offset="15179546">Thus, in one breath, the plaintiff alleges that we're transcending the boundary by 50 feet and then the next states, it can't be located.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.382" offset="15209430">Then plaintiff in an attempt to explain this inconsistency states on pages 2 and 3 of its supplemental brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.329" offset="15245270">Iowa has clearly misread the latter paragraph because paragraph 20 does not state that it is impossible in all areas to locate the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.097" offset="15284349">That states that it is not possible in many areas to locate the center line of the proposed stabilized channel of the Missouri River within the meaning of the 1943 Compact on the ground for maps presently on file in the office of the United States Army Corps of Engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.964" offset="15347775">These allegations are not inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.951" offset="15363762">Then plaintiff asserts on 9 and 10 of its supplemental brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.778" offset="15387063">The first paragraph towards the bottom about eight lines up, this would apparently create an artificial line as the new boundary rather than the moving river boundary which was subject to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.031" offset="15440039">The language middle of the main channel as used in the Compact would seem to be aligned on the applicable maps equal distance -- distant from each bank of the proposed stabilized channel or the design channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.319" offset="15493224">Since the deepest part of the main channel of the Missouri River, when it constituted the boundary previously, varied from shore to shore, it would seem that the Compact resulted in the creation of a new boundary at almost every place along the entire border between Iowa and Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.853" offset="15559367">In light of this, it is difficult to understand how Iowa can take the position that the Compact is completely irrelevant to the actions which it is bringing particularly since in some of the actions, Iowa surveys disregard the tread of a stream and run to the so-called middle of the designed channel or at least to what we would suppose Iowa considers to be the so-called middle of the designed channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.271" offset="15677022">Thus we find at this point the state of the Missouri River, first, we're over the boundary by 50 feet, second, it can't be located, third, it can't be located in all areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.955" offset="15719758">And then we are errant because our surveys disregard the tread of the stream and run to the center of the designed channel which is the Compact of 1943, the center of the design channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.379" offset="15781512">To this last assertion, we admit our surveys run to the center of the design channel of Missouri River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.819" offset="15811187">This is the precise language contained in the 1943 compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.859" offset="15835429">Thus, in this instance, we are saying that from a accumulative standpoint, their assertions of fact clearly do not call for a decree in the Nebraska's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.523" offset="15894047">And on the contrary plans last assertion that were running to the center of the designed channel, exonerates the State of Iowa from improperly locating the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.984" offset="15939918">Examining the allegation that Iowa is unilaterally advocating the Compact by its actions inquiring title, we find this to support plaintiff's allegation in the case of State versus Babbitt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.726" offset="16002821">First, the State of Iowa has according to Nebraska in that case, exceeded the boundary by 50 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.272" offset="16033019">Secondly, they turn to the interrogatories posed by the State of Iowa in that case submitted as an appendix by Nebraska and the answer to certain of those interrogatories carried on page 53 and 62 of plaintiff's motions -- motion respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.065" offset="16112222">Commencing with interrogatory 11, was any part of the land above ordinary high-water mark and contained within plaintiff's metes and bounds description in plaintiff's Second Amendment to petition formed by accretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.570" offset="16174184">That's the land where we're supposed to be over the boundary by 50 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.280" offset="16189022">If so, when did such accretions first arise above ordinary high-water mark?</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.437" offset="16209711">And in what state did the same first arise above ordinary high-water mark?</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.551" offset="16234162">Answer: Answering interrogatory 11, these dependent states that it is impossible at this time to determine the answer to this question for the reason that these dependents have not been furnished with a proper map, plot or survey, showing the area contained with plaintiff's metes and bounds description in plaintiff's Second Amendment to petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.628" offset="16330501">Interrogatory 12 is any part of the land in controversy, the same original identical land which was included in either the original Iowa survey or the area -- of the area made in 1851 and 1852, or in the original Nebraska's territorial survey made in the area in 1856.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.077" offset="16424229">If so, which survey included it and what part of the land in controversy was so included?</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.515" offset="16450038">Answer: Same answer as given to Interrogatory 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.524" offset="16469995">Interrogatory 13, did any part of the land in controversy come in to existence by accretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.099" offset="16496327">And if so, when did such accretions formed?</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.620" offset="16506462">In what state did they form?</text>
            <text syncTime="4128.430" offset="16513672">And to what did they accrete?</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.164" offset="16832575">Answer: Same answer as Interrogatory 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.573" offset="16832470">If you have -- Interrogatory 14, if you have answered the preceding interrogatory in the affirmative state, who was the owner or who were the owners of the river bed or riparian lands to which the land in controversy accreted?</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.988" offset="16832366">Answer: The same answer as Interrogatory 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.950" offset="16832261">Interrogatory 15, if you have stated and answered to any foregoing interrogatories that any part of the land in controversy in this case was in existence prior to 1920, state by what means or method you now identify that part of the land in controversy as being the same identical land?</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.314" offset="16832157">And lastly, Interrogatory 17, has the thalweg of the Missouri River ever flowed to the east of the area described in plaintiff's Second Amendment to petition or to the east of any part thereof which would be the Iowa bank or to the east of any of the same identical land which now exist in the area above ordinary high-water mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="4200.178" offset="16832052">And if so, when did the thalweg of the Missouri River so flow and for what period of time or periods of time?</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.720" offset="16850860">Thus, the matter submitted in connection with the plaintiff's motion in support demonstrates probably that the facts asserted clearly do not call for a decree in its favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4225.510" offset="16901956">It creates a paradox for Nebraska asserts that we are unilaterally abrogating the Compact in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.989" offset="16935915">Ownership which can only be established by the principles of law and the origin of the land in question which the real parties in interest provide by answering, they don't have the proper maps and plots to provide us with this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.745" offset="16994952">We respectfully submit that this deficiency does not warrant invoking the jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.214" offset="17024836">The State of Iowa or State of Nebraska takes issue at the State of Iowa in our position concerning the importance of the origin and formation of the river lands relative to ascertaining ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.848" offset="17075304">We submit that this is the only question, the precise question, and it is the sole question in determining ownership of riparian lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.148" offset="17108532">Inviting your attention to the first paragraph on page 28 and concluding on page 29 of plaintiff's supplemental brief, the State of Nebraska in substance makes -- takes issue with Iowa's theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.304" offset="17177182">And if the Court will clearly examine the legal conclusions that are discussed therein and examine the fact that Nebraska calls this our present theory, you will find that it is -- this is not the theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4314.262" offset="17257012">You could have nothing but a flexible boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4316.647" offset="17266521">We would have the thalweg rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.138" offset="17276552">The boundary was established in 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.299" offset="17289195">It was determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.205" offset="17292748">There is nothing to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4324.804" offset="17299122">It has to be located physically, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.345" offset="17309362">It would have to be physically ascertained if this Court made a judicial determination as to where it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4337.592" offset="17350322">The last sentence after discussing Iowa's theory, it says, this would seem to create a state of utter confusion along the Missouri River and one in need of a solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.176" offset="17396611">This is entirely true.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.974" offset="17403820">For in many instances, the river now runs entirely within the State of Nebraska or entirely within the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.088" offset="17432346">It has left a stabilized channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.910" offset="17443631">And the boundary in many instances runs over dry lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4364.988" offset="17459931">But the only solution can be by mutual legislative action of the respective legislators and the consent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.029" offset="17496085">The boundary was fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.496" offset="17501936">It cannot be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.415" offset="17509564">And the fact that the river may in some instances lie with -- entirely within the State of Iowa, is a problem that must be dealt with in the respective courts having jurisdiction on each individual case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.063" offset="17564212">A excellent example is in Appendix A of our brief in argument in opposition to the moment -- motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4399.060" offset="17596186">In that instance, Dartmouth College, draining its title through a Nebraskan riparian owner, sued another Nebraskan who was an adverse possessor in Iowa courts over land lying in Iowa by virtue of the Compact but situated on the right bank or the Nebraska side of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.105" offset="17708408">The State of Iowa intervened and our contention was that the land formed on the Iowa side and that there was an avulsion in 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.074" offset="17752294">And accordingly, the boundary did not change.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.315" offset="17769221">The trial court disagreed with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.743" offset="17778939">He held there was no avulsion and that the river gradually shifted to the left bank of the Iowa side.</text>
            <text syncTime="4450.166" offset="17800568">And accordingly, the boundary -- then boundary in ‘37 followed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.472" offset="17817809">And it became accretion to the Nebraskan riparian owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.771" offset="17835050">This is a hazard of owning land, riparian land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4462.837" offset="17851246">You gain some, you lose some.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.210" offset="17860754">Now in this instance, the Missouri River was then put entirely through the center of this island, the proposed stabilized channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.369" offset="17897430">And the boundary was sent right through the center of this island.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.131" offset="17912477">And they blocked the shoot on the Iowa side.</text>
            <text syncTime="4482.369" offset="17929404">They put the boundary through the center of this island.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.414" offset="17945600">Then the shoot broke.</text>
            <text syncTime="4489.098" offset="17956362">The revetments by the Corps and the river refused to go through the center of this island.</text>
            <text syncTime="4494.222" offset="17976842">The Nebraska shoot dried up and the land became contiguous with the Nebraska side of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="4502.794" offset="18011115">But by virtue of the ‘43 boundary compact, half of it is in the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="4508.345" offset="18033371">That was a precise reason that Dartmouth College sued Gerald Rose in our courts to quiet his title.</text>
            <text syncTime="4516.423" offset="18065659">And yet, it's on the westerly side of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="4519.904" offset="18079556">And now, being a property owner for a certain instance in the State of Iowa, he no longer has the right to accrete along the bed of the streams for he is now an Iowa owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.945" offset="18131696">And he must -- this land now must be governed by Iowa laws and the state owns the bed of the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.401" offset="18153535">But downstream where the river comes back where it used to be and he's a Nebraska riparian owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4545.242" offset="18180911">He can accrete to the center of the channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.108" offset="18196376">Now this is a situation of -- apparently, Nebraska feels that this isn't the state of the law and says it's a need of a solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.297" offset="18225110">This we submit gentleman is the law and is in need of a solution but can only be sent by a new boundary compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4568.971" offset="18275788">Finally, it is our position that it is clear that Nebraska's complaint about two specific cases which have not -- the individuals who are the alleged owners have not been made parties to this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.543" offset="18350080">We submit that although this Court has jurisdiction, original but not exclusive over a controversy between a state and citizens of another state it cannot be exercise in their absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4606.260" offset="18424999">And that this particular action filed by the State of Nebraska should be dismissed for the want of indispensable party's litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.197" offset="18468780">This Court has held repeatedly in for -- in Minnesota versus Northern Securities Company, an original suit in this Court wherein the motion was denied because of the absence of indispensable parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.139" offset="18524473">This Court stated at 184 U.S. 234 and 235, the general rule in equity is that all persons materially interested either legally or beneficially in the subject matter of a suit are to be made parties to it so there be may a complete decree which shall bind them all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4651.711" offset="18606811">It is clear and it is admitted by the State of Iowa that the specific parties, Henry E. Schemmel and Darwin Merritt Babbitt are not made parties to the State of Iowa or to this particular action and do in fact claim ownership in the lands in controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.277" offset="18673058">Nebraska, the plaintiff in this action, concedes or contends that they are in fact the owners accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.586" offset="18706286">A binding adjudication cannot be made by this Court affecting their rights and in their absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.783" offset="18751112">The authorities that the plaintiff relies upon, it should be pointed out that all involved either the question of where the boundary was since it had not been determined or the validity of the agreement that it established a compact between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4708.521" offset="18834077">But in this case, the boundary has been determined by our mutual legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4719.306" offset="18877127">Our plaintiff also mentioned Durfee versus Duke which he points out is a deformable situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.218" offset="18904816">And I think you'll find that this decision is illustrative of the indispensability of Mr. Schemmel or Mr. Babbitt in order for res judicata to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4735.465" offset="18941806">In that situation, the parties were before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4738.765" offset="18954971">The plaintiff has further asked in his brief where a statement destroying the presumption set down by the Iowa courts in Kittredge versus Ritter, 172 Iowa 55.</text>
            <text syncTime="4753.399" offset="19013590">I'd like to point out that that's a 1915 case and that was one of course we followed the rule of the thalweg.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.595" offset="19046296">And it's normal that a presumption would occur that if land is on one side of the river, it would be a natural presumption that it is in the state of the -- that it is nearest to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.352" offset="19089345">Because there is a presumption that in fact and in law against an avulsion of carrying -- occurring as opposed to the election in the normal processes of accretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4782.836" offset="19131246">Accordingly, his request that this presumption in Iowa should be struck down like I pointed out, it was a 1915 case and prior to the 43 Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.448" offset="19205747">We respectfully submit that the motion should be denied and that the State of Iowa be given the opportunity to proceed in courts of competent jurisdiction to ascertain ownership to land much in the same way that the State of Nebraska brings actions in its courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="4844.398" offset="19377528">He claims that they didn't give full faith and credit to this particular decree.</text>

            <text syncTime="4859.764" offset="19438968">And the Nebraska Court found that the land was never in Iowa and accordingly the title was no good.</text>

            <text syncTime="4874.109" offset="19496333">Let's suppose the complaint by Nebraska says, near the track of land A and they described it, which the time the Compact was entered into was located in the State of Nebraska and was owned by Mr. X. Iowa promised to respect that title in the Compact if we convey -- if we gave up our claim to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4898.844" offset="19595285">We put in effect quick claim any interest that Nebraska had to the State of Iowa in exchange for that promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.887" offset="19623497">Iowa is now asserting that it owns Track A and has sued Mr. X in the Iowa Courts to establish title of the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.241" offset="19664875">We allege that Iowa is breaching its promise that it gave in the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4922.068" offset="19688176">And we ask that the United States Supreme Court take jurisdiction and adjudicate our claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4928.764" offset="19715030">Iowa of course says Track A wasn't in the State of Iowa or in the State of Nebraska at the time the Compact was formed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.516" offset="19746064">That track came into existence by accretion after the Compact was formed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.953" offset="19767798">I'll use -- just on those bare facts, was there a suit between two states if we ought to pick jurisdiction out here in this Court?</text>

            <text syncTime="5190.182" offset="20760660">We think we have specially alleged the breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="5193.212" offset="20772780">We would like to -- we wonder really in light of our -- Iowa's argument, what the purpose of the Compact was?</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.400" offset="20793574">What the Compact was intended to accomplish?</text>
            <text syncTime="5200.589" offset="20802351">Particularly when we considered that at the time of the Compact, we have land on which taxes had been paid in Nebraska since 1895.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.012" offset="20835997">We had land -- the same land which had been surveyed and was in 1933, 10 years prior to the Compact was on record in the Nebraska County.</text>
            <text syncTime="5217.202" offset="20868807">They have the quiet title action to it in 1940 in Nebraska with all of the individuals before the Court at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="5224.619" offset="20898377">There had been land sold through in the state proceedings in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5227.968" offset="20911856">Individuals lived on the island.</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.388" offset="20917499">They voted Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.503" offset="20921992">There were these census reports in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="5232.207" offset="20928784">Children were born and died on the island.</text>
            <text syncTime="5233.923" offset="20935680">We found that (Inaudible) verse recorded with the Nebraska Bureau of Vital Statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.008" offset="20951980">The inhabitants at all times considered themselves inhabitants of the State of Iowa and Iowa when this is raised says that these titles are spurious.</text>
            <text syncTime="5246.088" offset="20984268">Well, we wonder what situations like that would -- the purpose of the Compact was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.542" offset="21002136">We think that we're entitled as between ourselves to a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5253.891" offset="21015510">If Nebraska ended up giving away a lot of things without extracting any promises, if we really got take in there for suckers, we want to know we're suckers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.988" offset="21043931">We think we're entitled to know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5263.728" offset="21054903">This Court even in its dissent has recognized in Arkansas against Texas which was cited by the defendant that if a controversy between two states concerns a construction a Compact, this Court must of course determine their rights and necessity and we think we're entitled to a determination of these rights as between ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="5280.742" offset="21122926">We entered into the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.689" offset="21130658">We entered into the commitment not our citizen but we did and we think we're entitled to know now what this means in light of the situation which developed.</text>
