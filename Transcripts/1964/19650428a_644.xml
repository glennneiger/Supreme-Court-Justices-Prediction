            <text syncTime="67.422" offset="269688">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="69.112" stopTime="1011.451">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="69.112" offset="276376">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.938" offset="291736">This case is here on certiorari to the Court Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to review a decision setting aside an order of the Federal Power Commission made under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.622" offset="346488">The case is one of great importance because if that decision stands, it opens what we conceive to be a very serious gap in the power of the Commission to regulate prices at which produces sell gas to pipelines under the Phillips Petroleum case.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.504" offset="426005">The essential facts are these, Texas Eastern is an interstate pipeline company with a system running from South Texas up to Northeast through Philadelphia and on to the New York area.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.035" offset="484101">The other respondents in this case are oil and gas producers who held leases in the Rayne Field in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.787" offset="523076">Early in 1957, the respondent producers, agreed to deliver gas in the Rayne Field, Texas Eastern at the initial price of $23.59 per thousand cubic feet over a period of what would probably be about 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.403" offset="593607">Texas Eastern then applied for certificates to construct the necessary facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.321" offset="617221">Under the Phillips Petroleum case, the Federal Power Commission clearly had jurisdiction not only over the construction of the facilities, but also over the agreement to sell the gas in the price at which it was sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.439" offset="677721">At this point, the Third Circuit rendered a decision in the Catco case which later came before this Court which made it apparent that the Commission could not approve the sale by these respondent producers to this pipeline company because this sale was at a price a cent-and-a-half higher than the sale which had been sale price that have been disapproved by the Third Circuit in Catco.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.853" offset="791406">The respondents then cancelled their agreement to sell the gas and recast the deal in the form that it is now before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.228" offset="836859">As in the form that it is now before the Court, the respondent producers conveyed to a newly created subsidiary of Texas Eastern.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.859" offset="879386">Their leasehold rights to gas in the Rayne Field down to a specified depth together with wells and related equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.370" offset="921391">Reserving, it's important to emphasize is the so-called production payment all the condensates that could be extracted from the gas as it came from the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.378" offset="969456">This new subsidiary then assigned its rights under the leases to Texas Eastern.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.601" offset="1002371">Texas Eastern retained the respondent Continental which had been operating the field for the benefit of all the producers, under a management agreement to continue to operate the field, extracting the gas from the ground and ultimately delivering it to Texas Eastern.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.610" offset="1082410">The consideration for the lease was $134 million about 9% payable in cash and the rest are paid in notes of the subsidiary which fell due periodically through the expected life of the gas field.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.166" offset="1156598">Texas Eastern assumed no contractual liability and the subsidiary had no other assets beyond the lease that it assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.791" offset="1203096">Texas Eastern then went back to the Federal Power Commission for certification of the construction of the necessary facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.564" offset="1234233">At that stage, it was June 1959, the Commission assumed that it had no jurisdiction over this lease transaction and issued the necessary certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.473" offset="1281881">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on review set aside the Commission's order upon the ground that the Commission might either go into the price at which the gas was transferred or the cost of the gas to Texas Eastern, or it might state clearly then entirely but that it had heard and indicating in the course of its opinion that the price or cost was in the public interest without sufficient evidence in the record to support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.567" offset="1410194">And I should say that in the course of its opinion, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit also assume that the Commission had no jurisdiction over these transactions as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.429" offset="1465678">Upon remand, the Commission reopened the entire matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.305" offset="1485218">It then decided contrary to its early assumption and contrary to the assumption of the Circuit Court that the lease sale transaction was itself within the Commission's jurisdiction as a sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale and ultimate public consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.234" offset="1572885">On review, the Fifth Circuit set aside the Commission's order holding that since the transaction involved a lease of mineral rights, it constituted production and gathering and was not a sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.527" offset="1654073">We then brought the case here adjoined by one of the distributing companies in Philadelphia area represented by Mr. Coleman and the question very simply is whether the Commission was right in holding that it had jurisdiction or whether the Fifth Circuit was right in holding that it had not.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.800" offset="1731187">The case turns on Section 1 (b) of the Natural Gas Act which is printed on pages 2 and 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.211" offset="1776744">It gives the Commission jurisdiction over the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce and more importantly over the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale for ultimate public consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.039" offset="1840065">But it excludes the production and gathering or production or gathering of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.567" offset="1870263">The term sale in interstate commerce of natural gas and production for gathering are used in contradistinction as this Court held in the interstate case in the Phillips Petroleum case.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.218" offset="1928777">If a transaction involves a sale of natural gas in interstate commerce, then that part of the transaction at least is not production of the gathering and therefore not excluded from the Commission's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.370" offset="1985411">Consequently, we can concentrate here on the question whether these transactions, this lease sale transaction that I described constitutes a sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.750" offset="2058971">And the starting point of course in inquiring into that question is the settled premise to their producer's agreement to sell and deliver natural gas to an interstate pipeline company is subject to regulation by the Federal Power Commission, and that was the Phillips Petroleum case in 347 U.S. and of course it's been predicated in numerous subsequent decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.582" offset="2158237">There's not the slightest doubt to put the points specifically that the respondent producers earlier agreement in this case to sell the gas in the Rayne Field to Texas Eastern over a 20-year period and its implicit dedication of the gas to the public, to the performance of that contract, I should say, was a sale requiring certification by the Commission and subject to its disapproval.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.611" offset="2278400">Our argument is that the recasting of the transaction made it no less a sale in interstate commerce of natural gas and we proceed in three steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.771" offset="2331063">First, we say that the Commission had ample basis for concluding that revised transaction viewed from the standpoint of the policy of the Natural Gas Act involved what was both in fact and in economic function a sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.903" offset="2419566">Texas Eastern thereby acquired gas as a pipeline for interstate transportation and resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.144" offset="2448509">It thereby fixed the cost of the gas that it was going to resell and it didn't really take on to any significant degree of the functions of a producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.870" offset="2495425">Second, we submit that whether a transaction involves a jurisdictional sale as they say, a sale in interstate commerce depends not upon concepts and definitions that may be important in the law of sales and conveyancing, but upon as I put it the fact and economic function of the transaction viewed from the policy of the act that we're charged with applying, viewed here from the standpoint of public regulation of this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.557" offset="2638158">And then third, we distinguish the Panhandle case which was so much relied upon by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.907" offset="2679536">Very little argument it seems to me is necessary to show that the Commission had ample basis for concluding that from a regulatory standpoint, the transaction and the question had the same functions and would have the same kind of effect upon rates as an ordinary agreement to sell such as was involved in the Phillips Petroleum case.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.990" offset="2771905">Conversely, it seems to us that when you look at this from the standpoint of its substance of its economic function or the fact that the distinctions between this and an ordinary lease for exploration, development, and production become very, very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.993" offset="2859886">Let me emphasize just a few points; first, what Texas Eastern obtained here was natural gas for its interstate pipeline system.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.003" offset="2907951">The Rayne Field was proven largely developed and so the estimates of the amount of gas there varied, it's clear that that was gas in a very large quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.718" offset="2958838">Texas Eastern as a pipeline wanted that gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.426" offset="2973675">It wasn't interested in exploration or development or production.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.470" offset="2997812">The conclusive proof I think is that these transactions did replace a conventional agreement to sell the gas lasting over a period of roughly 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.351" offset="3041384">No one has ever suggested so far as I am aware that there was any substantial reason for recasting the transaction except the effort to get it out from under the Commission's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.163" offset="3092584">Indeed, in withdrawing the application, the old applications for proof, the respondent Continental gave as the reason in seeking leave to withdraw them that all the producers had entered into negotiation with Texas Eastern to sell their gas in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.840" offset="3175340">They described it as a sale of gas and they said that by assigning the leasehold rights, such in place sale of natural gas had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.076" offset="3224242">Second, I would emphasize that Texas Eastern took on very few of the typical functions of a producer or gatherer.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.920" offset="3263634">It acquired only natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.067" offset="3276173">All the oil or other mineral rights were withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.774" offset="3295086">The net proceeds from all the liquefiable hydrocarbons, so what could be extracted from the gas were reserved as a production payment to the producers say for a little bit at the end of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.271" offset="3353078">The respondent producers even reserved the rights to the gas deep down below a specified level where further exploration might be conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.289" offset="3397068">And finally, I would point out that to a large but not 100% extent, Texas Eastern even left with the producers the responsibility for bringing the gas to the surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.472" offset="3461851">That responsibility of the field had been managed by Continental.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.899" offset="3479510">A Texas Eastern subsidiary entered into a management contract with Continental on giving to it most of the work of bringing this gas to the surface, also it reserved certain ultimate rights and responsibilities and just as the producers had paid before the cost of Continental is doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.620" offset="3566446">So under the agreements, the cost came out of the production payment assuming that there was any production payment because they were condensates and thus was subtracted from what all the producers would get under the production payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.984" offset="3635931">And so in all probability would be born in the same fashion as originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.829" offset="3659233">Third, I would emphasize that this transaction was the final step by which gas would pass from true producers into the pipeline where interstate transportation at sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.897" offset="3715553">We're not dealing here with a transfer of leasehold rights among producers, those who are interested in exploration, development or simply in bringing the gas up under circumstances where another transfer would be necessary to put the gas into the interstate pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.639" offset="3798518">This was the transaction, the final commercial step that committed the gas to the pipeline system for interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.683" offset="3846687">And fourth, I would emphasize that this is the transaction just like the kind of agreement involved in the Phillips case that fixes the cost of the gas to the pipeline and it will therefore be a critical element in fixing Texas Eastern's rates that it may charge to the distribution companies and so ultimately to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.651" offset="3938534">There are exactly the same reasons here for regulating this transaction that there were for holding that the Commission had jurisdiction in the Phillips Petroleum case.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.720" offset="3990779">And I could confess that I can think of no reasons that would lead to not regulating this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.950" offset="4019722">It might not also have been applied in Phillips Petroleum case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1016.751" offset="4066952">Well, I mean I assume that there was an undeveloped lease is there the same reason then?</text>

            <text syncTime="1021.614" offset="4086387">Well, I would need the term developed and undeveloped don't have quite definite context to me that enables me simply to discuss it in those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.873" offset="4131422">I think there is room for a number of distinctions here chiefly to be made on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.165" offset="4164650">If one goes way over to a transfer of a potential oil field among people who are engaged in the business of producers or perhaps simply the transfer of a potential oil field to a pipeline company where exploration and development must be carried on, that it seems to me is a very different kind of transaction and would be treated by the Commission quite differently.</text>

            <text syncTime="1071.055" offset="4284186">If there had been here a transfer of the lease at all levels and the company took over the operation of the lease, would there really be any difference here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.382" offset="4341447">It would still be, I would think you would say, there was a sale of gas.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1089.530" offset="4358060">I think we probably would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.866" offset="4367464">I look at it Mr. Justice White, let me put the two steps in our argument in the reverse order that I stated them before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.800" offset="4403200">I would say first, as the matter of our general principle that we say that the question in general, the test in general, is whether the essential substance of the transaction viewed from the standpoint of public regulation is that a pipeline acquires the right to a quantity of gas for interstate commerce and it commits itself for the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.466" offset="4505809">If that's a fair description of what's really the heart of the transaction and I intend to exclude other things, it would overbalance that when I state it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.339" offset="4549277">That I say is the appropriate test under the Act and whether that is --</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1141.449" offset="4565786">-- I'm really coming back to your point if I might say just a word or two about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.923" offset="4587624">I think that the proper test under the act is the one I've stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.206" offset="4604761">That of course is a question of law that this Court must decide, what is the proper test?</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.048" offset="4628167">Then, as to the application of that standard in any particular case, Mr. Justice White, I think that's a question that is essentially delegated to the Commission as this Court's decisions in Gray and Powell and the Hearst case and others like them teach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.593" offset="4702354">Now, I think -- and I think I'm coming directly to your question in deciding just what change is here tip the case from one side of the line to the other, it depends on examining the facts from the standpoint of the criteria that I've stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.899" offset="4779572">In this case, the facts are very, very strong for holding that this is in fact an economic substance of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.826" offset="4811233">One should suggest, as you did.</text>

            <text syncTime="1218.843" offset="4875285">I think this is very similar, if I may suggest you, like the problem of deciding who is an independent contractor and who is an employee for the purposes of many labor laws in social legislation that you can make all kinds of small differences and the line has to be struck somewhere, but the difference in principal and the cases of who is an employee of social and labor legislation, depends on the policy the economic reality from the stand point of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1298.758" offset="5195024">I would say that it was rather the essence of the thing, the guts of the thing, if I may put it colloquially, is whether they were really getting gas and whether they were really fixing the price at which they got gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.758" offset="5251030">And if that is a fair way to characterize it, then it is within the Commission's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.232" offset="5276839">Now, if you add more and more things in addition to the getting gas and make the amount of gas more and more speculative, then the case gets farther away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.073" offset="5324278">It may get so far away that the Commission's decision would not have warrant in the record in the reasonable basis in law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.589" offset="5362312">For example, one of the things, Mr. Justice White, that distinguishes the instant case from the conventional agreement to sell gas is that here Texas Eastern does take of some economic risk that would not be taken under the -- by the pipeline under the familiar agreement to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.913" offset="5455621">It will lose if it turns out to be less gas than it thinks there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.098" offset="5476310">It will gain if it turns out to be more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.514" offset="5493969">And I would say that that was a relevant circumstance, I would doubt, we certainly think it isn't decisive in this case because in this case steps have been taken both to insulate Texas Eastern from any personal liability and to make it possible to throw up to lease without future payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.710" offset="5582785">If it turns out to be too bad a deal, I would doubt to taking more economic risk would be enough to tip the case the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.442" offset="5617685">But I think each of these things has to be taken into account to determine what is the reality of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.171" offset="5648614">I come back perhaps at risk of repeating myself, I would say, that one way to look at it is to say is this a transaction which from the standpoint of the purposes and policies of the Natural Gas Act as developed in the Phillips Petroleum case has the same characteristics?</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.904" offset="5747566">Now here, from that standpoint it makes not the slightest difference where the Texas Eastern gets the gas under a conventional agreement as originally arranged or by the sale of the leasehold interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.164" offset="5800647">The need for protection of the consumers is just to say, the statutory safeguards are equally appropriate in the one case than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.358" offset="5837427">And the assertion of jurisdiction creates no danger of interference with state regulation of production and gathering indeed the Commission specifically said was not interfering with that part of the aspect nor does it create any risk of federal intervention at the stages of the industry, truly antecedent in any substantial sense to the sale of the gas in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.231" offset="5968875">There just aren't enough other real facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.002" offset="5983922">There aren't -- just aren't enough differences in economic function to say to draw a line between these two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.056" offset="6020180">Now, as I understand the respondent's brief, they did not really deny what I've been saying about the economic reality of this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.094" offset="6068349">As I understand their argument briefly stated, comes to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.042" offset="6088098">The instruments they executed they say were not a sham but entailed substantial consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.230" offset="6116833">Their legal effect was to give Texas Eastern a leasehold interest in real property under which it have the right to bring the gas to the surface and to obtain title by severing it and reducing it to possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.478" offset="6181825">Such a conveyance of an interest in real property, they say, is not a sale of natural gas because it isn't the transfer of title to a commodity and it's not a sale in interstate commerce because you don't sell real estate in interstate commerce, and this is an interest in real estate.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1594.885" offset="6379520">The first fault we find with this argument is that it proves too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.969" offset="6403866">The typical long term agreement such as was involved in Phillips, to sell and deliver natural gas which is conceded to require a Commission approval, does not then and there pass any title to the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.282" offset="6473038">You agree to sell and deliver it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.537" offset="6482129">You fix the price but the gas remains in the ground, it is not a commodity at that stage anymore than it said to be a commodity at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.019" offset="6524029">And of course title passes in the future when the gas is delivered and so here are the title to the gas as a commodity, well I suppose pass in the future, it passes by a somewhat different process, it isn't delivery from the seller to the buyer, it's rather the buyer, as we would call him, capturing it by taking it out of the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.324" offset="6637296">Second, to the extent that I don't know just how far it does, but to the extent that the respondent's argument is that this is a sale of natural gas within the meaning of the Act applies only the selling above the ground and not to a sale in place, because the gas when it's in place is not a commodity, I suggest it produces a distinction which from the stand point of purposes of the Act is demonstrably absurd, I don't mean any disrespect but consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.321" offset="6801241">If that is really the line of distinction, then a producer could agree that he would now sell and pass title to so many million cubic feet of gas in the ground, and this could be done in Texas where you can make such sale, at a price for a thousand cubic feet and I suppose even to be paid upon delivery, and there's no reason that title can't pass in a sale and present it to be made before something is delivered to that's part of a normal law of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.609" offset="6954423">It surely when the Court decided the Phillips Petroleum case, it didn't intend to open that easy door to the evasion of the regulatory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.362" offset="7005414">So that this distinction between selling the gas when it's in place, and selling the gas when it's above the ground, I submit, comes to nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.913" offset="7043553">But our real difference with the petitioners, I really anticipated, that is the difference in terms of what is the governing criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.087" offset="7084304">We do not say let me make it perfectly clear we do not say that this transaction was a sham.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.866" offset="7115442">The form the transaction took has practical and legal consequences, some of its legal consequences may be very important as between the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.919" offset="7159641">It has some practical consequences different from the ordinary agreement itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.552" offset="7182106">What we say is that those concepts are all right in their place that the criterion from the standpoint of the application of the Natural Gas Act is the economic function, the substance of it, and that from that standpoint, the differences between this and ordinary agreement to sell are small and unimportant in this case and that the similarities are overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.193" offset="7316689">Now, I could develop that some length the general principle that in at least in applying a regulatory statute, the Court will not apply the technical -- will not be governed by the technical form in which the parties cast their transaction, even so that form has importance for other purposes and they as between them, but it will look at the economic facts from the standpoint of effectuating the policy of the particular Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.780" offset="7471020">The cases on that point go back as far as early cases under the Interstate Commerce Act of which B&amp;O against Settle is one the best examples and they come down to such a decision as the Lo-Vaca Gathering case decided by this Court quite recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.246" offset="7544895">The cases it seem to me most enlightening, I suppose because I'm most familiar with area, are the cases rejecting the common law test for the purposes of social and labor legislation in determining who is an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.582" offset="7622322">There, the Court has said that regardless of the consequence for tort purposes that the particular appropriate thing to do is to see whether the particular workers are subject as a matter of economic fact to the evils the statute was designed eradicate and whether the remedies heretofore are appropriate one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.659" offset="7718557">And that's the way we think whether this is a sale should be approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.523" offset="7742067">As a matter of economic fact is this really a transfer of the interest in natural gas for resale to the public, and is the remedy is appropriate here as it was in the Phillips case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.578" offset="7790237">We think the answer for the both cases is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.665" offset="7802567">The case most closely impart is one which I could confess I overlooked its significance when we prepared our original brief is Gray and Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.551" offset="7854184">Gray and Powell involved the question whether there was a sale of coal for the purposes of the Bituminous Coal Co. because the code provided, no coal shall be sold or delivered or offered for sale at a price below the minimum established by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.345" offset="7933283">And what happened there was that a railroad a heavy user of coal leased some coal lands and then it hired somebody to bring what it said was the coal in which should have a lessee's interest to the surface and turn it over to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.430" offset="8009665">And it said there is a no sale here because there is no transfer of title from the man who is digging the coal, the company that's digging the coal of course to us Seaboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.787" offset="8071105">And the Court said without pausing to quote from the opinion that it didn't matter whether there was a technical sale and the transfer of title from the producer or not, that the purposes of Congress would be hampered by an interpretation that requires the transfer of title in the technical sense to bring a producers coal consumed by another party within the ambit of the coal company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.961" offset="8167758">And so here, it seems to us, that while this isn't exactly on all force because there, there was a question whether there was a sale by the company that did the mining to the railroad, here we don't even have to show that as long as we show that there was some sale, but we think in principle, both in the way the problem was approached and even in principle on the holding that Gray and Powell is governing here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2174.307" offset="8697208">And if what we are saying here does not require any overruling of Panhandle or modifying of what I would say was the holding or really the -- or that It's probably against us, because I think it's broader that it needed to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.657" offset="8778606">Now, in Panhandle, as many of the Court will recall, Panhandle operated an interstate pipeline system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.155" offset="8812565">It also held leases on lands in the Kansas Hugoton Field where apparently it functioned as a producer and exploration of development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.346" offset="8849345">Also this was a field where there was pretty well known to be gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.145" offset="8868571">The gas reserves in place there had never been dedicated to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.925" offset="8895634">They never flowed or indeed by have been committed even by contract in any sense to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.280" offset="8925100">But they had been cited by Panhandle as a source from which it intended to get gas, or could get gas to pipe through certain facilities that it had asked the Commission to certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.418" offset="8985600">When the Commission sought to bar Panhandle from transferring the leases on the Hugoton Field to a subsidiary which would function as a producer and perhaps also as an intrastate pipeline, the Court held that the Commission had no jurisdiction, saying that the transfer of undeveloped gas leases is an activity related to the production of gathering of natural gas and beyond the coverage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.559" offset="9094165">Now, the critical and I think undeniable difference between the Panhandle case and the case at bar is that there, the transfer of the leases was not a step by which an interstate pipeline secured gas to transport interstate and resell for public consumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.168" offset="9188624">Whereas here, on this lease transaction, as it is called, is the step by which interstate pipeline did procure its gas</text>

            <text syncTime="2321.004" offset="9283918">Some of those costs, there was a question about whether they should be included or not, but the sale as such was, I suggest, a moving away from interstate commerce rather than a moving interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.965" offset="9335850">Let me see if I can develop that thought by pointing out the precise differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.526" offset="9354031">Hugoton was not an interstate pipeline, Texas Eastern obviously is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.287" offset="9377123">After the transfer, Hugoton would function initially as a producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.511" offset="9401992">It would develop the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.285" offset="9409097">It would gather gas and it would complete the development and complete the decisions as to where or how it was to be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.341" offset="9445355">Texas Eastern won't really function in that respect at all, except in some very minor detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.072" offset="9472209">In Panhandle, the gas could not and would not move into interstate commerce, into an interstate pipeline, without some further transaction, some further sale in the sense that we used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.369" offset="9537411">Whereas here, of course, this, as I've said before is the transfer in interstate commerce, because that's true it's also true that what Hugoton paid Panhandle would not necessarily and perhaps not at all have the same significance in fixing the ultimate rates at which somebody carried this gas interstate as the price paid here will have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.541" offset="9658096">Now, I suggest that those factual differences between moving something out of interstate away from interstate commerce and moving it interstate into interstate commerce are paralleled by the difference in the legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.833" offset="9723298">There was no opportunity for the Commission to argue there that what was involved was a sale of natural gas in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.604" offset="9762377">But the arguments have to be that this if not so far dedicated to the field.</text>

            <text syncTime="2520.069" offset="10080235">One is the opinion in Clay Brown was expressly recognized, that where these is some strong evidence with respect to a contrary policy of the particular statute then that may be controlling with respect to the meaning in words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.790" offset="10167066">And I can't believe that the Court in Clay Brown intended to modify its decisions in Gray and Powell, Hearst case, the Lo-Vaca Gathering case and a whole line of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.022" offset="10208026">Second, I suggest there is a major difference between legislation of this kind and the tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.282" offset="10261107">Even accepting as of course, we do in that decision, I would say that the tax laws to a greater extent at least, take the transactions as they find them for other purposes, if Your Honors, sees what I'm trying to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.605" offset="10338325">That there isn't any overwriting aim, many function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.036" offset="10360059">They are intended to be in a sense neutral, and to accept the business purposes of people as they carry them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.629" offset="10386495">I don't want to overstate that but I think that is a marked difference between the two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.156" offset="10416588">I just want to say one further word before yielding to Mr. Coleman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.022" offset="10444069">I think it is obviously true that if you take the language in the Panhandle case, that undeveloped leases are facilities of production, and apply that in a wooden fashion as a universal principle, then it is inconsistent with our opposition here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.408" offset="10529541">But I don't think the Court ever means its words to be read in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.237" offset="10552947">There are leases and leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.266" offset="10560993">That lease had as I've attempted to show an entirely different function than the assignment of this lease has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.494" offset="10589936">And I don't think the language was intended to lay down a universal proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.530" offset="10618044">And therefore, is not controlling on any justice in this case whether he agreed with the philosophy of that case or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2677.617" offset="10710413">Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.006" offset="10723997">Petitioner in Number 644, the United Gas Improvement Company is a Pennsylvania public utility, and is a distributor in natural gas to the residential, industrial, and commercial customers at Philadelphia and upstate Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.340" offset="10785332">We purchased a substantial part of our natural gas supplies from respondent, Texas Eastern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.805" offset="10815216">Thus, it's of vital concern to us what is the actually course the Rayne Field gas to Texas Eastern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.869" offset="10847399">The course of the estimates of the Rayne Field gas varied in this record from 17.5 cents to 24 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.332" offset="10877283">And this should be compared with the fact that in Catco this Court held that where the record show that the gas would move in interstate commerce at 22.04 cents per Mcf that that should have alerted the Commission and caused the Commission to hold a hearing and determine whether that price was in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.620" offset="10954397">Now, it's clear here that “but for” the decision of this Court in Catco that the parties here would have made a traditional type of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.430" offset="10997656">And therefore, the point here is whether the parties by merely changing the form of the transaction are able to move gas from the discoverer and the owner of the gas to the pipeline into interstate commerce, and put that cost in the pipeline's rate base and still escape of public regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.752" offset="11086994">In fact, the issue here is even narrower, and that is whether the Commission had within its power and its judgment the right to determine that what took place here was essentially a sale for resale of natural gas and interstate commerce, and therefore, should be subject to regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.903" offset="11171527">Actually, the issue here is easier for this Court than the issue in the Phillips case because as you recall in the Phillips case, the Commission had made an investigation and determine that in each judgment that it did not have to regulate the producer in order to be able to carry out its statutory obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.774" offset="11251043">But here, the Commission tried awfully hard to protect the public interest by not having to regulate this transaction but only after it made the inquiry and made the determination that the only possible way that it can protect the consumer was to determine that because this gas in effect was going to move at interstate commerce that therefore, it would have to be regulate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.586" offset="11358250">Now, what did the Commission had before which would justify such a determination?</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.340" offset="11381342">In the first place, it knew and it had the fact Continental Oil, Sun Oil, and the other producers except for Marr were known to be gas producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.071" offset="11420212">And it had been found to be so on many occasions, and in fact, decisions of this Court have recognized that Sun Oil and these other companies are in the business of producing gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.054" offset="11460127">Secondly, the record shows that Continental Oil, the owner of this gas originally was the one that discover the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.864" offset="11487399">Third, the Commission had the fact that these parties, by their original contact demonstrated what they wanted to do at the business matter was transfer this gas from the discoverer into interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.588" offset="11538286">And the only reason why Texas Eastern ever wanted this gas was to sell it in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.533" offset="11558034">In the fourth place, the parties knew by the time this field had been developed and this contract had been entered into exactly what Texas Eastern was getting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.803" offset="11599203">If you would turn to the record in volume one sir, there is an exhibit on page 163.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.945" offset="11671719">I guess before the luncheon break, Your Honor, I asked the Court that they turn to page 163 of the record and you see this --</text>

            <text syncTime="2951.424" offset="11805675">And it's also important to note that even after the transaction was completed, that the party who had been the original owner of the gas and the discoverer of Continental Oil was the one that was to do the lifting of the gas from the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.347" offset="11873384">Indeed, when you turn to page 828 of the record, the management agreement, in the whereas clause, you will see a notation that one of the conditions which would cause the pipeline to go into this transaction was that Continental assured pipeline that Continental would be available to do the lifting of the gas from the ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="3115.355" offset="12461349">You were not dealing with leases where they have been fully discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.218" offset="12480784">You were not dealing with leases where they had been fully proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.463" offset="12493845">That there you had undeveloped leases and the leases were being transferred not to a party who has going to resale the gas in interstate commerce, but indeed, they were being transferred out of the interstate commerce market into the intrastate market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.030" offset="12560091">And the problem before the Commission, I'd like to spend a minute on this if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.037" offset="12576078">The problem before the Commission and Panhandle was completely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.710" offset="12594782">In Panhandle, what the Commission was faced with was the fact that when the pipeline wants to resell gas to a distributor company, it has to get approval to say that we want to resell on a day-to-day basis so many Mcf per day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.512" offset="12666044">Now, to get that approval under Section 7, they have to prove that they have the reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.232" offset="12688927">Now, after they proved they have the reserve, the question then becomes the next day can they denude themselves of those reserves and not to be subject to jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.217" offset="12736784">Now, that's what Panhandle dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.616" offset="12746397">The question was whether because of the words in Section 7, which says that if you're going to sell to the consumer in interstate, you have to get approval to do that, and if you come before the Commission and say that we ought to be permitted to do this at the pipeline because we hold this reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.710" offset="12814838">Can they thereafter sell those reserves in the intrastate market, not be subject to regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.851" offset="12835318">You must recall that that transaction or the Panhandle situation was before Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.288" offset="12861127">Now, I would think that once Phillips was on the books, you had a completely different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.982" offset="12875860">And the Court probably would have decided Panhandle differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.515" offset="12889966">But leaving that aside, there's nothing in Panhandle which says that if the Panhandle, instead of selling those undeveloped, unproven reserves to the intrastate market had decided to sell proven reserves where you can actually almost by name and number identify the gas to a pipeline that was going to resell in the interstate market, then that that would not have been subject to jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.594" offset="12998322">Indeed, I think that's what you're decision in 331 U.S. and interstate pipeline says that whether pipeline decide to sell some of its gas at its own to another pipeline that's going to immediately transfer the gas in interstate commerce that that is subject to jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.552" offset="13058194">I think, therefore, any person sitting on this Court at the Panhandle case, I really think that that when you had this problem, you really even shouldn't go to that Panhandle case because it's completely a different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.099" offset="13100304">And so what you really have to determine here is whether the production and gathering exemption, which is in Section 1 (b), which says that even though interstate sale for resale are subject to jurisdiction, that this does not mean production or gathering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.633" offset="13186508">Now, I think what the words mean, it does not mean mere production, a mere act to producing, or the mere act of gathering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.942" offset="13211690">But there's nothing in the exemption which says that if you have something that is a sale for resale in interstate commerce of natural gas, that because the contract or because the passage of title is to take place prior to the time that production or gathering is completed, then that means that what is otherwise the sale for interstate commerce for resale of natural gas, somehow, gets taken out of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.128" offset="13320464">I think the legislative history makes it clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.164" offset="13332584">And one thing is clear in this case, the legislative history makes it clear, that as far as the Congress was concerned, they didn't think they needed the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.834" offset="13363304">That if you had a sale for resale in interstate commerce, that was clearly regulated, and that was all they intended to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.378" offset="13389427">And that's what is happening here, and the fact that the transaction is dressed up so that part of it may take place before you get all the gas out of that is completely relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.786" offset="13431118">You still have a sale for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.952" offset="13439791">Now, the cases have made it clear and the one thing has been constantly litigated in the Court of Appeals and the decisions are uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.796" offset="13467167">That where the sale takes place prior to the completion of the gathering, which is also in the exemption, that if what is happening is a sale for resale, namely from the producer to the pipeline, and that's in the interstate market that clearly that is subject to jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.897" offset="13543549">And it just seems to us equally as clear, the way you have a situation where the transaction here and the Commission founded a fact and the evidence is clear on this, that by this transaction, that what the parties intended and the only thing they intended was to move this gas from Continental Central Oil into the interstate market to a pipeline that sold only in interstate commerce that you clearly had a transaction which is in interstate commerce and is the sale of gas for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.158" offset="13680536">And the production exemption and the gathering exemption had nothing to do with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.146" offset="13696522">And this Court really faces problem in Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.356" offset="13709375">And there, it determine that because the gas was to be resold in interstate commerce to the pipeline, the fact that the producer after executing the contract, nevertheless, still had to lift the gas out of the ground was completely irrelevant, because the thing that Congress wants to prevent is the high cost of gas being paid by the pipeline, and then that being charged against the consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.712" offset="13818776">And if you have a situation the way you do here, where if Texas Eastern at this price, is able to take the gas into its pipeline, at a such a price that a proper finding on this record may be that the cost is 24.5 cents per Mcf, that under those circumstances that the only way to protect the consumer is that that transaction is regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.092" offset="13928281">Now, you can't regulate it merely by the pipeline because with the pipeline, it had to pay the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.283" offset="13965061">And the only way you can protect the consumer is to regulate the producer or the discoverer of the gas, and to say that the price that you're charging is not in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.812" offset="14007171">And so therefore, we submit that based upon the facts, the findings here, based upon the purpose of the Act that it's clear, that if this Commission, which is trying to do a good job is going to be able to protect the ultimate consumer, that it has to have the power where parties say, “How can we frame a transaction which will have the same identical economic effect and if you had a conventional sale, that somehow that doesn't escape regulation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.393" offset="14133499">And this is completely different from a tax situation where what you're trying to do is determine who has the economic benefit of the gain because that's the man that has to have the money to pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.665" offset="14182609">Here, what you're trying to do is determine for purposes of regulation, how do you protect the public?</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.404" offset="14209567">And the only way to protect the public here is to look at this transaction, the way I think, with all due respect, any school boy would look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.415" offset="14241646">That clearly, you have natural gas here, clearly the parties intend it to lift it from the ground, to pass it in interstate commerce, clearly the pipeline is going to pay for it and it seems to me that just by reading the statute, this is a sale for resale in interstate commerce regardless of what else also you want to call it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3598.324" offset="14393260">Well sir, I first say that in Phillips, you could have done exactly the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.680" offset="14410710">So you start up with the fact that in Phillips, if you want it you could have told the pipeline if you buy their gas with Phillips at 25 cents even though that's what you paid for, we are still going to let you put it in your rate base only at 20 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.729" offset="14462851">Secondly, I say, that the test where the utility actually pays the money is whether it made an investment which is provident or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.268" offset="14500989">Now, that's a test which is much higher than the test as to weather the price for the gas is the public interest price and here you have it very dramatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.604" offset="14538397">If the sale is regulated by the producer and if we followed Catco and if we followed what happened in Catco and remand when it went back and they tried what was the public interest price, they determine that the price could not be more than 20 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.698" offset="14594717">Now, if instead of that you're going to regulate it by whether Texas Eastern in an arms-length transaction where it paid $134 million was acting as a good businessman or not which would have to be a test and you have one on the record here that made the prices 24 cents where the Commission as very difficult work away to go to say that under those circumstances, we have to knock out the other 4 cent point nine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.353" offset="14689384">Now, the other thing is Your Honor and I think is you have to realize this that if this strike had been right on the Texas Eastern main pipeline, the Commission would never have been called upon to do anything with respect to Texas Eastern which would even call into play its power to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.806" offset="14775171">Under the law, under Section 7, the pipeline doesn't have to get approval to buy the gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.890" offset="14799517">The one that needs approval is the one that sells the gas and the only reason why the pipeline got involved in this was because to take the gas it had to construct 22 miles and had to build a compressor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.452" offset="14845806">Now, that mere fortuitous circumstance that the strike was not only on the line should not be the basis on which you call into play the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.959" offset="14879765">Secondly, the real issue here should not be what the pipeline paid for the gas but what the producers paid and what it caused them to bring the gas from the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.383" offset="14917486">So unless the producers are made part of this record and they're subject to regulation, you're going to have Texas Eastern trying to litigate this matter by having to prove what somebody else's cost were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.613" offset="14958446">So it seems to me that's all you had in Phillips and this Court in Phillips after looking at this said that the only way to protect the consumer was to regulate the producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.220" offset="14996793">Now, Phillips came after Panhandle and that's the practical way that this has to be handled.</text>

            <text syncTime="3758.921" offset="15035664">Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.812" offset="15051233">Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation which is the pipeline respondent in this case filed its application in this case for certificate of public conveyance and necessity eight years ago before the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.835" offset="15119256">Its application was for authority to construct certain facilities along its main line and also to build a 22-mile line from its main line for this Rayne Field and a compressor station on that 22-mile line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.354" offset="15189368">During this period of time, there have been three Commission opinions, two decisions by the Court of Appeals on two different appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.939" offset="15243703">Both Court's of Appeals, the D.C. Circuit and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the sale of these leases was a non-jurisdictional sale but each Court of Appeals said basing their decision upon the decision of this Court in Catco, that the Commission could determine whether the acquisition cost of Texas Eastern were consistent with public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.851" offset="15383301">In 1959, six years ago, the Commission rendered its decision in opinion Number 322 in which it held that this was a non-jurisdictional sale of leases and the Commission in that opinion disclosed why this was very important public interest for the pipeline company too far of this basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.775" offset="15487060">In this order issued by the Commission, it required Texas Eastern to build this pipeline and these other facilities within six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.382" offset="15529482">Texas Eastern complied with the order, built the facilities, and since August 19, 1959, has been taking natural gas from the Rayne Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.775" offset="15579011">Now, petitioners say here, and their position as we understand, is that the sellers of this leases and Texas Eastern you were trying to circumvent the powers and jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission and rights on with the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.765" offset="15659050">We take issue on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.899" offset="15667513">We say the purpose in buying these leases was not to circumvent the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission but we say as the situation developed and as the circumstances disclosed by this record to establish, it developed that the only feasible deal that could be made in this case was for Texas Eastern to buy the leases and that natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3943.226" offset="15772839">And why do I say that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.806" offset="15783184">Because there was a hearing at that time Texas Eastern proposed to buy this gas from these companies under gas sales contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.922" offset="15823621">There was an extended hearing before an examiner and in that hearing the purchase of this gas by Texas Eastern which was opposed by some of its most substantial customers including the United Gas Improvement Company of Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.249" offset="15888927">And one of the main bases for the opposition was this, if Texas Eastern buys this gas and this was brought up by extensive cross-examination of Texas Eastern witnesses, it will trigger “favored nation” clauses under Texas Eastern's insisting contracts, there being 32 contracts was brought out on cross-examination will be triggered and the increase in the annual cost of natural gas with Texas Eastern would be $10 million a year which would be passed on to the customers and in turn of course to the consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.708" offset="16046811">And so these customers of Texas Eastern has one as the Public Service Commission in New York, vigorously opposed this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4020.949" offset="16083696">And in the meantime and has been stated by the Solicitor General by Mr. Coleman, the Court of Appeals decided the Catco case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.913" offset="16119641">It really went off on the point that the Commission didn't have jurisdiction that's -- of that application but that was reversed by this Court but nevertheless the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit made it very clear that prices and cost should be considered by the Commission in a certificate case and as Your Honors said, when that price falls within the disputed area, it's one of the most relevant factors to be considered in a certificate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.466" offset="16245864">So in view of the holding by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and in view of this opposition which had taken place on the hearing in regard to these gas sales contracts, and knowing that this question about triggering these “favored nation” clauses, would be a most serious obstacle to a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.118" offset="16328411">Texas Eastern then approached these producers who became sellers to sell the leases to Texas Eastern because if they purchased leases instead of natural gas, it would not trigger the “favored nation” clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.421" offset="16401659">And it also have been brought out on cross-examination of Texas Eastern witnesses at this first hearing that it would trigger not only the “favored nation” clauses in Texas Eastern contracts, but it would trigger what was known as third party “favored nation” clauses in the contracts of other pipeline companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.916" offset="16471562">And so Texas Eastern proposed to these producers, sell me the leases covering all of the area through the known horizons that are known to be productive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.957" offset="16527778">After all, Texas Eastern knew that producers would not sell in deep horizons which have never been explored by the drill bit, because they might be given away an oil field if they did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.680" offset="16566648">Any sophisticated producer or a company just as doesn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.981" offset="16587860">Well, after considering the matter, this proposal by Texas Eastern to buy the leases in which they contented this will not trigger the “favored nation” clauses in our contract, appeal to these companies who turned out to be the sellers of the leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.705" offset="16662779">First, they would get a $12,420,500 cash payment at the time of the closing transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.859" offset="16699350">They'd get money now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.394" offset="16709486">They would get the balance of the consideration over a period of 16 years in annual installments instead of waiting for the life of the field which was 31 years, so as a result they were willing to take a substantially lower cost for their natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.176" offset="16788689">Now, under the gas sales contracts, price would been 22.6 cents but if you take the amount of recoverable gas that was conveyed or was covered by these leases, the price was 17.15 cents that it cost Texas Eastern, and that was the price first to be received by these sellers of the leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.489" offset="16889940">Another factor that appealed to the sellers of the leases was this, if they can sell leases instead of natural gas, they could get possibly Catco gains tax treatment, they thought they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.719" offset="16938841">And a condition of the entire transaction was that the Internal Revenue Service would have to render them on opinion first that this would be given Catco gain tax treatment before they would make the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.774" offset="16999027">So having paying their 25% Catco gain tax as compared with 52% ordinary tax was a real inducement to the sellers of these leases to go forward as well as getting the money in the early day.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.539" offset="17058064">And of course the inducement of the Texas Eastern was it would not trigger the “favored nation” clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4270.074" offset="17080216">And so the parties entered into an agreement for the sale and purchase of the leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.231" offset="17104875">Now, Texas Eastern was very interested in having Continental Oil Company continue as the one who do the drilling and operation of that field.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.748" offset="17150955">The reason for that was Continental had developed the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.860" offset="17167360">There were very high pressures in that field.</text>
            <text syncTime="4295.578" offset="17182302">They were very difficult to complete in and for Texas Eastern to incur the cost of putting a new organization there and the risk which might come from dealing with those high pressures was out of the question, so they ended in to what they call a management contract in which Continental was implored as the management agent of Texas Eastern to operate the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.305" offset="17285120">But no wells could be drilled except those requested by Texas Eastern and since the matter has been closed, Texas Eastern has caused to be drilled five wells at its cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.596" offset="17326289">The amount of production from that field can only be the amount of production designated by Texas Eastern.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.194" offset="17352725">All of the reworking of the wells, the deepening of the wells can only be done upon the authority of Texas Eastern, so Texas Eastern through this management contract controls that field.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.316" offset="17401208">Now, after the party has entered into this transaction for the purchase of the leases, they submitted with the Internal Revenue Service for rooting on the capital gains tax and then they submitted to the -- in back in 1958 to the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.143" offset="17460558">And the Federal Power Commission issued its opinion Number 322 in June 1959 and it found this entire transaction to be in accordance with public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.873" offset="17511445">It pointed out in its opinion that those customers of Texas Eastern and we think this is a rather important fact here, which had opposed the purchase of gas by Texas Eastern on the gas sales contracts had now withdrawn their objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.462" offset="17581767">They didn't object to the lease purchase sale although they had the objective vigorously to the purchase of natural gas under those gas sales contracts and they didn't object to the lease purchase sale because they knew the lease purchase sale would not trigger the “favored nation” clauses in the Texas Eastern contracts and thereby bringing about an increase to $10 million a year in Texas Eastern costly gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.652" offset="17678524">And one of those customers was the petitioner, United Gas Improvement Company and the hearing before the Federal Power Commission after this when this matter was submitted to the Commission, United Gas Improvement Company read a statement into the record to this effect, but this was a step in the right direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.662" offset="17758563">What do they mean by that?</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.364" offset="17765355">The purchase of these leases by Texas Eastern is a step in the right direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4445.688" offset="17782700">We favor this because they meant this will not trigger the “favored nation” clause and all of the customers, as the Commission found, withdrew their objections to the lease transactions although they had oppose the purchase under gas sales contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.982" offset="17847902">The only concern, the only one it opposed it was Public Service Commission of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.086" offset="17868278">Now, in its opinion finding that they had no jurisdiction over this matter, the Commission went on to say, it's important for a pipeline company to own leases, it gives it flexibility of operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.172" offset="17912686">They can produce larger quantities in the winter, smaller quantities in the summer and that is very much in the interest of the public and other consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.703" offset="17946749">Texas Eastern is enabled to treat this as a storage field in effect because it owns the leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.865" offset="17971409">They found of course the price was fixed for 31 years, the life of the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="4498.857" offset="17995337">There wouldn't be escalations in the future such as we have had and before the Commission that caused so many rate cases before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4506.228" offset="18024908">There was one price that was the price determined at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4510.636" offset="18042462">No favored nations, no future re-determinations of price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4514.245" offset="18056882">So the Commission after setting out all of those facts found that an unconditional specific public convenience and necessity should issue to Texas Eastern.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.888" offset="18103484">The Public Service Commission appealed that to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by filing a petition for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="4533.721" offset="18134831">One of their main contentions was the contention which is made by Mr. Coleman here in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4541.372" offset="18165447">They contended that the first, the Commission should not have approved the terms of the trade because there wasn't substantial evidence to support the cost of the gas of Texas Eastern.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.658" offset="18210586">That's one of the main contentions, so the Court of Appeals says.</text>
            <text syncTime="4558.361" offset="18233365">When the matter was decided for the Court of Appeals, they recited the contentions of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4564.325" offset="18257293">The Court of Appeals clearly held that the sale of leases was non-jurisdictional and not subject to jurisdiction of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4575.100" offset="18300343">But the Court of Appeals for D.C. Circuit said that it was error for the Commission to pass on the price or the acquisition cost for Texas Eastern without having substantial evidence to support them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.866" offset="18351438">So they sent the case back and we say for a limited purpose and they said to the Commission, you can do either one of two things you can follow either alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4600.265" offset="18400967">You can clarify your former opinion by showing or stating that price is not approved here at this term.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.801" offset="18447151">Now, if the Commission had done that this litigation would have ended 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.133" offset="18476513">But the Court of Appeals said you might, you can follow the other alternative, you can reopen the record for the purpose of permitting Texas Eastern to support its acquisition cost by evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.621" offset="18550387">The Commission thought of that course and in July 1961, entered an order which required Texas Eastern to offer evidence in detail supporting its acquisition cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.086" offset="18620291">Volume 2 of this record, substantial or it's made up of the evidence of Texas Eastern Oil, exhibits a detailed evidence to support the fact that its cost -- acquisition cost were reasonable that these acquisition costs were consistent with public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.571" offset="18690194">And the Commission after ordering Texas Eastern to offer this evidence and specify it in detail what type of evidence would be offered and after the hearing was over and the matter was presented to the Commission for decision, the Commission refused to pass on the issue of cost despite the decision of the D.C. Circuit and despite the Commission's own order of July 1961 which directed Texas Eastern to offer evidence of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.076" offset="18800222">They said that we have jurisdiction over the sale of these leases and they further directed the parties to resend this lease sale transaction retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="4711.973" offset="18847869">And to enter into gas sales contracts and submit them to the Commission because they said we cannot adequately pass on the sale of leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.322" offset="18893218">Now, the respondents here filed their petition for review to the Fifth Circuit from that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.901" offset="18927595">The Fifth Circuit likewise held basing its decision also on the decision of this Court just as D.C. Circuit have done in Panhandle Eastern and made it clear that the Commission had no jurisdiction over a lease sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.447" offset="18997708">But the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said, “We will reverse this case so that the Commission can reject the application, grant the application or grant the application conditionally in view of the acquisition cost of Texas Eastern.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.297" offset="19073149">And then the Fifth Circuit said, “It is with regret that we note that this is essentially what the D.C. Circuit told the Commission to do three and one-half years ago.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.865" offset="19135425">So the Commission brought a petition for certiorari here and the issue of cost has not yet been passed on despite this Court's decision in Catco which said that it's one of the prime considerations in a certificate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.531" offset="19198119">We say first that the Commission was bound by the decision of the D.C. Circuit that this was a non-jurisdictional sale, that the reversal to the Commission was for a limited purpose that is either write a short opinion clarifying this matter and saying we're not approving price or else receive evidence to support the acquisition cost of Texas Eastern.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.761" offset="19303027">But instead of doing that the Commission had gone contrary to the opinion of the D.C. Circuit and has held it they had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.183" offset="19344718">Now, we say that the decision of the D.C. Circuit would apply in the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.490" offset="19361959">Section 19 (b) of the Natural Gas Act which provides for the filing of the petition for review in the Court of Appeals says, that the decision by the Court of Appeals in the absence of review by the Supreme Court is final.</text>
            <text syncTime="4857.676" offset="19430609">Statutory finality was given to this decision of the Court of Appeals by reason of the statute and it's our position that that decision that the Commission had no jurisdictional dismisses at finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.697" offset="19494766">Now, the issue between us on this point seems to be this, they say in their briefs although the matter has not been discussed here this morning, that the Court of Appeals did not actually decide that the Commission had no jurisdiction over this matter and if what they said about it was actually dictum and that shouldn't have been binding on the Commission that is what we understand to be the petitioner's view here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.147" offset="19608555">We say, they expressly said the Commission did not have jurisdiction over this sale of leases, and furthermore, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit could not erase the conclusion that they did without deciding that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.874" offset="19667487">They couldn't have sent the matter back just for the Commission rather clarifying opinion that it was not approving the price unless they thereby held that the Commission had no jurisdiction over this lease sale that was impertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.413" offset="19725584">Or they couldn't have sent it back just for the purpose we submit of taking evidence on the acquisition cost unless -- of Texas Eastern unless they thereby had not held that the Commission did not have jurisdiction over these leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.313" offset="19789218">Further, we say, that there's no statutory or there's no gap here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4954.674" offset="19818684">That is of course a usual argument made by the Commission when it seeks to extend this jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4960.997" offset="19843971">They have made that argument before the Congress that unless they had control over direct sales they would be an attractive gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.342" offset="19881273">They have made that argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.553" offset="19894126">Since Panhandle Eastern was decided in 13 or 14 years, the Commission in its annual reports to the Congress has asked Congress to give it jurisdiction over the lease sales by the natural gas company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.250" offset="19960999">So far, despite those 13 requests, Congress has not done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.392" offset="19985554">And the only year that the Commission did not request that it be given jurisdiction over lease sales was the year they rendered their decision which is now on review in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.052" offset="20044173">But then they told Congress in their annual report that they had made a policy decision to take jurisdiction over lease sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.150" offset="20080536">We say a policy decision is for the Congress and not for the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5026.842" offset="20107285">Now, although, we say that there is no gap here because you have two Courts of Appeals which you told the Federal Power Commission, you can pass on these acquisition costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5040.846" offset="20163291">And furthermore, we have the order of the Federal Power Commission which it entered upon the reversal in the D.C. Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5049.908" offset="20199549">And which have stated to carry the evidence to be offered by Texas Eastern and we say they in effect converted this certificate case after it was reversed by the D.C. Circuit into a rate case by reason of the character evidence which Texas Eastern required to offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5066.061" offset="20264229">At page 871 of the record an up-to-date reserve and deliverability study for the Rayne Field to include actual production to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.925" offset="20307696">Two, annual production plans for the Rayne Field extending to the estimated life of the field since there has been an operator that would be 29 years in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.025" offset="20356075">Annual production plans to 29 years, an exhibit showing the proposed method of accounting by Texas Eastern for the Rayne Field transaction and all cost instant thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.427" offset="20405708">And then fourth and finally, a study, cost of service study showing the cost of making the natural gas from the Rayne Field available to the Texas Eastern system and then they said you must include every cost which will be associated with making this Rayne gas available to the Texas Eastern system for the life of the field just as an all cost that Texas Eastern would not claim in subsequent rate cases where you have the question as to whether rate or the cost is just unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5139.117" offset="20556382">Now, in view of that requirement on Texas Eastern to come forward with that character evidence, we say that the consumer was assured that the acquisition of cost of Texas Eastern would be passed on in this certificate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5156.920" offset="20627644">Here was detailed evidence required.</text>
            <text syncTime="5159.488" offset="20637884">Texas Eastern complied with that order Volume 2 contains all of these evidence in regard to this cost evidence and the Commission was thereby enabled to pass on the acquisition cost but have to order Texas Eastern to produce this evidence, they have refused to pass on it up to this time but instead said well we rather have jurisdiction over the sale of those leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.239" offset="20740911">Now, we say that there can be no gap as long as the Commission can require in a certificate case such as done here with this extensive evidence to be offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5197.825" offset="20791275">The Commission is enabled to pass on the acquisition cost to determine whether or not they are reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.657" offset="20814576">And thereby determine whether a certificate should be granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="5228.740" offset="20914887">But I say they certainly have to look to the reasonableness of the cause not to determine that they're just and reasonable as those words of art are used in rate cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="5549.978" offset="22199902">We determine what their cost are and we would allow them only a rate of return on those costs and we don't think that where you're passing on the acquisition cost that you would investigate the cost incurred by the sellers in buying the leases, in exploring that the leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5569.865" offset="22279419">And so, the difference is and I would say that would be the difference that under the contentions by the petitioners, if the producers were in here and that's what the Federal Power Commission wants.</text>

            <text syncTime="5599.150" offset="22396552">So they say that when you're buying, both should be subject to control over the Commission and the Commission says they would have greater control over the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="5703.607" offset="22814407">They could look to determine what are all the costs Texas Eastern will acquire in making this gas available to its system and they could compare the gathering cost with gathering costs in other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5714.585" offset="22858292">It gives the Commission considerable control over the acquisition cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="5719.956" offset="22879817">And I say they can go to all of the cost that this Court had in mind when it decided Catco.</text>
            <text syncTime="5725.749" offset="22902909">And that is any cost that bears upon public convenience and necessity and as the Court said, speaking to Mr. Justice Clark, prices in important consideration, and in a certificate case, you can determine whether those costs are consistent with public convenience and necessity which is rather a broad term.</text>
            <text syncTime="5745.268" offset="22981068">And any cost that would fall in that category, I say, could be examined in the certificate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5752.106" offset="23008340">Now, we say that this Natural Gas Act is not actually here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5758.382" offset="23033522">Because Congress was very careful not to use its full Commerce Clause power to its limits in giving the Federal Power Commission jurisdiction here.</text>

            <text syncTime="6962.183" offset="27848725">So the leases here weren't fully developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6964.586" offset="27858338">But that's immaterial, the fact is the leases were been proved up in that case and was able to estimate that there was involved there 700 billion cubic feet of natural gas.</text>

            <text syncTime="7283.911" offset="29135621">That's exactly our position and we say that the Commission cannot only do that Mr. Justice Brennan, in the rate case but they can do that in the certificate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7292.334" offset="29169267">But they can't determine what profit the United States still is making for these hundred million dollars of pipe that it sells to the pipeline company, can't go into those costs or what profit it's making.</text>
            <text syncTime="7303.165" offset="29212630">But it can determine in view of other costs which would be incurred in buying other pipes and so forth, whether or not the pipeline company is incurring it probably, they're making a provident investment or an improvident investment in buying that pipe, one of those compressors this case might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="7323.105" offset="29292356">Now we -- we say that the Commission has no jurisdiction to over these sellers of these leases but they will beat no gap because this right to pass on the acquisition cost will adequately protect the consumers, wasn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="7361.978" offset="29447837">Well, the pipeline company made a deal here and you'd think it made a good deal and it wants to go forward with this deal that which is made back in 1958, and it's been trying for a number of years to have this mater finally determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="7376.546" offset="29506142">And it thinks it made a better deal here by buying to get a large reserve of gas if trade in cubic feet located just 22 miles from its main line.</text>
            <text syncTime="7385.754" offset="29542922">Therefore, it will incur low gathering cost in bringing that gas to its line.</text>
