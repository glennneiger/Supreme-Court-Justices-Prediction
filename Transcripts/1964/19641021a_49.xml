            <label>Mr. Nils Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="80.528" offset="322038">Exactly, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.245" offset="340950">My argument consists of three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.312" offset="365192">The first point is that there was no clear and present danger requiring the conviction of the appellant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.916" offset="407615">The second point is that neither one of the state courts which passed on this action applied the clear and present danger rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.724" offset="450873">And the third portion of my argument is that there was no evidence upon which to convict the appellant herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.643" offset="510537">In order to determine whether or not there was a clear and present danger in this instance, we must look to the circumstances of this case, what was said and done on the one hand and what was not said and done on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.505" offset="582008">You must look to the purposes of this demonstration.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.500" offset="593920">The demonstration was held to protest the previous day's illegal arrest of the 23 Negro students.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.286" offset="637074">I might add at this point, Your Honors that nothing has happened to these students since they were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.969" offset="671869">In other words, at the time on the December 15th demonstration, they were in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.438" offset="697678">They had been booked.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.980" offset="703843">They were not formally charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.885" offset="711471">They were never arraigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.760" offset="718994">They were released on bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.760" offset="727040">And the statute of limitations has now run on the picketing which prompted the demonstrations for which the appellant was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.721" offset="778867">The reasonable implication being that since this is the case there were some reasonable grounds for the demonstration against the arrest of these people.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.734" offset="942916">I think it's reasonable to say that -- we can't say that the songs that were sung, the prayers that were had, influenced the judge or obstruct the justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.069" offset="1004251">We must look to the speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.079" offset="1012297">What did Cox say or what didn't he say?</text>
            <text syncTime="255.740" offset="1022955">He admonished the people against violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.939" offset="1031732">In fact, he told them that if he was vowed upon to forget it, if -- if he were hit, to turn the other cheek.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.306" offset="1073215">In addition to that, just about 12 o'clock, he told the people as was previously said that, “It's 12 o'clock, if you're hungry go downtown and sit in until you were served.”</text>
            <text syncTime="283.157" offset="1132565">It was just at this point that a number of things happened in my interpretation of the facts almost simultaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.098" offset="1184392">The sheriff told them to move on and the testimony is conflicting as to whether or not Cox did say, “don't move” or whether he said, “don't run”.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.350" offset="1225352">As a matter of fact, the record has testimony to the effect that two orders were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.164" offset="1252624">First, the sheriff told them to move on and as some policemen were -- made physical contact with the people, they were told “wait a minute” and then a second order was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.951" offset="1307794">Now, the State would have us believe that there was a deliberate order “move on” and then another clear cut order “move on again”.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.177" offset="1340604">But I submit and on the basis of what I've suggested that there was a conflicting order.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.009" offset="1364010">And of course this has been bypassed largely in the handling of the matter at the trial court and at the state Supreme Court level.</text>
