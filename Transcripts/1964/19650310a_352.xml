            <text syncTime="46.005" offset="184007">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.073" offset="196232">My associates are Thomas J. Hughes of Michigan and William T. Plumb of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.239" offset="228937">The problem involved in this case is the geographical attribution or apportionment of net income for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.481" offset="265822">The District of Columbia Income and Franchise Tax Act imposes on corporations carrying on business within and without the districts a franchise tax measures by net income daily attributable to that portion of the business which is carried on within the District and then the Act directs the District Commissioners to prescribe by regulation formulas for properly determining such portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.029" offset="380029">And the questions which that Act and the regulations under it raise with respect to the assessments made against the petitioner for 1957 and 1958 are whether that statute authorizes the Commissioners to use for this apportionment purpose, a single factor of sales formula that is attributing to the District that portion of petitioner's entire business net income from all sources which the gross receipts received from sales to customers within the District thereto total gross receipts from sales throughout the world.</text>

            <text syncTime="168.053" offset="672183">Fairly attributable but it probably should have itself determined what was fairly attributable instead of leaving it to regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.239" offset="696947">That's the only quarrel of the statute and that's not a constitutional point.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald K. Barnes</label>
            <text syncTime="180.374" offset="721398">No sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.813" offset="735190">If so, that is if the statute does permit that then the next question is whether such formula is here applied as unconstitutional and that's the two reasons, one is for attributing to the District net income out of all reasonable proportion to income derived from District activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.815" offset="811259">As a matter of fact, the figure shows there's 11 times as much quite beyond the limits of due process and furthermore taxing values and reaching activities of someone which are not within the territorial jurisdiction of the District.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.753" offset="866952">And second, discriminating against interstate commerce by double taxation, by the result in double taxation and by imposing it by bargains which business entirely confines the District did not have to bear.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.193" offset="924735">The facts in the record are voluminously set forth in great detail but the essential ones to the issues which we raise here are these but the petitioner's business is primarily the manufacture of motor vehicles, 95% of the income which was attributed to the District by which these assessments were based is derived from the manufacturer in the sale of vehicles and parts which are manufactured wholly outside of the District and in general sold outside the District to customers located in the district, so I shall not pay attention to the evidence weighing the other 5% for the purpose of this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.841" offset="1091291">The pertinent products are Cadillac automobiles, GMC trucks and GMC coaches all of which are manufactured entirely in Michigan, Chevrolet automobiles and trucks which are assembled in Maryland and Buick automobiles and Pontiac automobiles which are assembled in Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.560" offset="1162240">These were all sold through offices outside the District insofar as we're here concerned to customers within the District generally independent retail dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.794" offset="1207171">They set all the manufacturing and most of the selling activity occurred outside the District but they were related in District activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.660" offset="1234547">And they were permins -- principally sales promotion work by traveling representatives having both their offices and their residences outside the District.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.608" offset="1274358">In 1957, one of the two years here, the payroll for the time spent by these people in the District was $65,000 for which the District attributes income for $5,166,000, its net income and the tax of $258,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.895" offset="1359517">The figures are the same order for the next year.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.077" offset="1372264">There are offices in the District which are not directly related to the sales of these automobiles and their presence in the District had no bearing on the assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.843" offset="1411344">It wasn't considered in any way by the finance officer in making his computations.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.976" offset="1519804">The same thing which causes the assessments to violate the Constitution is in the first instance, a violation of the statute.</text>

          <turn speaker="donald_k_barnes" startTime="388.900" stopTime="959.440">
            <label>Mr. Donald K. Barnes</label>
            <text syncTime="388.900" offset="1555540">As I said, this is unrelated offices in the District had no bearing at all on the assessments made by the finance officer but they were considered by the tax court in its computations and their activities are reflected in those.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.142" offset="1616562">Now, the petitioner paid the tax under protest and sued for refund in the Tax Court and then the Tax Court expert economic testimony was brought in to show the geographical sources of income that is whether the activities occur and the property exist which are in the income and expert economy testimony to show how to measure the contribution of each of those productive sources on the interstate, on the double taxation question returns were introduced which showed the amounts and the bases for taxes paid to the states where the cars were manufactured.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.664" offset="1762638">Now, the Tax Court based on all of that found those facts and I'm reading from the appendix to our brief, page 3A where the Tax Court's opinion is reproduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.823" offset="1819272">The segment of the petitioner's business which was conducted both within and without the District of Columbia consisted of a manufacture of a certain number of automobiles and kindred products without the District and the sale thereof to customers within the District.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.934" offset="1883638">That net income from this segment of petitioner's business was earned by a series of transactions beginning with the manufacturer products in several states and ending with sale to the customers in the District.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.578" offset="1938286">While the net income was not realized until sale, it was earned in part by manufacturer of the product sold including in addition to actual manufacture, procurement of material, financing, use of property and administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.449" offset="2005786">In continuing, the method used by the assessing authority of the District attributed to the District 100% of the net income derived by the petitioner from that segment of his business which consisted the manufacturer without and the sale of products within the District.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.950" offset="2079765">The percentage as determined was out of all reasonable proportion to the trade or business carried on or engaged in by a petitioner with the -- within the District.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.532" offset="2122083">And one more, finding three covers the amounts of tax paid to Maryland, Delaware and Michigan and then continues apportionment of net income of petitioner derived from the segment of the petitioner's business consisting of the manufacture of products without and sale within the District of Columbia was taxed by the above mentioned states pursuant to apportionment formulas with factors or property, payroll and sales as provided by their laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.755" offset="2242978">The Tax Court then reach this conclusion of law which was that the assessments were not authorized by the statute because it's not complying with the requirement that -- of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.607" offset="2282371">The income from the business conducted within and without the District be deemed to be from sources within and without the District and apportioned accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.466" offset="2321763">Having thus found that the single factor sales formula was invalid and that being the only one supplied in the regulations, the Tax Court then as it is permitted to do being an administrative party applied a -- its own formula which was the familiar three-factor property -- formula of property, payroll and sales as used in so many states.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.442" offset="2409744">The effect was to reduce the tax for 1957 from $258,000 to a $101,000 and -- or refund was ordered to the difference in the figures $258,000 with the same order.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.172" offset="2460630">The Tax Court did not consider the constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.883" offset="2479438">A division of the Court of Appeals, the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed two to one on the opinion below.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.303" offset="2513189">In rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals reversed five to four so we have an even split among the judges who so far heard the case, five upholding the assessments and five declaring them and the regulations invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.876" offset="2571494">Now, the majority of the Court of Appeals said that since the assessments did not include income from business conducted entirely outside the District having no connection with it, the income of the petitioner was apportioned which was all that the statute require.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.853" offset="2635337">And though they suggest that the Tax Court's formula might be better, they said that it wouldn't be forced on the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.534" offset="2666057">The Court of Appeals said that the finding that a 100% of the income from business done within and without the District had been attributed to the District was irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.279" offset="2709107">And hence the finding that such attribution was out of all reasonable proportion had no factual basis and that double taxation has not been proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.524" offset="2750067">Now, the central error in the Court of Appeals' reasoning here is holding irrelevant the fact that the application of these gross receipts fraction miss -- segregates the amount of income which is derived from the only business with which the District has any connection that is that part of the total business which is conducted partly within and partly without the District and having recognized that as the amount of income to that sec -- of the segment, taxing a 100% of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.399" offset="2901577">They say that the Court of Appeals held that was irrelevant not that it didn't happen but it was irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.711" offset="2922789">That fact though is the fact or those facts which establish that the formula as used by the District and the assessments made by the District did not comply with the statute requiring income to be deemed to be from sources within and without and apportioned accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.170" offset="2984647">And those facts are the ones which established that there was taxation of a much greater share of the petitioner's income and arose within the District.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.356" offset="3025398">And also those facts are the ones which established double taxation and that the fault of double taxation was of the District and not the other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.862" offset="3063432">Identifying the segment income does not apportion anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.898" offset="3083494">The experts pointed this out without dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.774" offset="3095092">They said that the district's formula finds 100% of the income from all business culminating in sales to District customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.637" offset="3134485">The formula deems all such income to be from District sources and does not as required by statute, deem it to be from sources within and without.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.518" offset="3178057">Now, that this kind of a calculation reaches a 100% of such income as obvious and it's well illustrated in the Tax Court's opinion by the hypothetical case of a manufacturer -- manufacturing entirely of Maryland and selling entirely to customers in the district, obviously would be taxed under this formula on a 100% of it's entire income from all the world and that is not apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.559" offset="3270217">It makes no difference that in the case of this petitioner, there was a great deal of business consisting of the manufacture of automobiles in Michigan and selling them to the customers in California is completely beyond the concern, that the District is concerned only with the cars which are manufactured somewhere Maryland, Delaware, Michigan and sold to customers within the District.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.289" offset="3357153">The fact that it may not tax those California transactions, there's no authority for it to tax a 100% of apportions, which is related in a small way to the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.547" offset="3406158">Paraphrasing Underwood Typewriter Company against Chamberlain which was the first case in which this Court considered an income tax apportionment formula, the Tax Court found that the income here involved was earned by a series of transactions beginning with manufacturing and procurement and management all of which occurred in other states and ending with a sale with the customers in the District.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.728" offset="3498841">Alright, the finding was correct, in fact as established by the experts we brought that income has its source in capital and labor and it's correct in law as established by this Court and often repeated that income is again derived from capital, labor or both combined.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.172" offset="3576686">And there, it is the contrast between this case and General Motors Corporation against Washington where we were be talking about a gross receipts tax which was related to activities carried on within the District and had nothing to do with the sources of net income which is the problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.991" offset="3659964">There the -- it was a question of relating activities to sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.372" offset="3681384">Here, the question is relating activities to net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.024" offset="3696013">There are some activities in the district, the Tax Court well measured them but the great majority of the activities were outside the District throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.243" offset="3736869">Now, when the income is apportioned on the basis of the employment of capital and labor within and without the district, the amount of such income, this is gross and of net income would be $466,000 in the District for 1957 and $254,000 for 1958 and that's about one-eleventh of the amount that was assessed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1200.116" offset="4800366">The dissent in the Court of Appeals said that the evidence overwhelmingly sustained the findings of the Tax Court one in which was that a portion of the same income which was taxed 100% by the District had been properly taxed by Michigan, Maryland, and Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.191" offset="4864731">Now, it's obvious that the double taxation occurred in fact because if the state of manufacture basis their tax on manufacturing activities as Michigan, Maryland and Delaware do, the state and the stay to the situs of the customer attributes all income arising from those activities to the situs of the customer as the District does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.626" offset="4958459">The same income inevitably is being taxed twice and this is not a mere minor overlap that occurs because of the differences of opinion as to exactly how detail should be worked up where but is a fundamental conflict.</text>

            <text syncTime="1586.217" offset="6344829">Since the Commerce Clause does not seem to be applicable, I would conceive further that if the Commissioner's regulations comport with the statute then if the statute itself might impair a commerce in the way that a state might not do it, then the Commissioners have not acted improperly or invalidly in adopting a regulation which comports with the statutory requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="2561.083" offset="10244284">You had devised a formula in the double taxation area and as I recall it, it consisted basically of the imposition of a tax upon all items manufactured within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.402" offset="10329548">By that method, I would suppose that this particular jurisdiction could almost foreclose the taxation of other income or income itself because the taxing state to which you refer having first taxed, other jurisdictions would presumably be prohibited from taxing because by so doing, it have introduced the element of double taxation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2621.390" offset="10485551">But when you get to double taxation, I think you're somewhat on a circular track because by proceeding from state to state, you can select those jurisdictions which may validly impose a tax and interdict all the others from imposing a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.189" offset="10556709">And certainly, that's not the intention of these several decisions which the Court has concerned itself with in these areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.967" offset="10599863">I might say sir again, it suggest that the three-factor formula is the only proper formula to be used here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.008" offset="10627971">Actually, the petitioner says that the only one which makes economic sense and should be applied is a two-factor formula consisting of property on the one hand and payroll or labor on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.860" offset="10675409">I'm not an economist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.923" offset="10683664">I have some difficulty in rationalizing the production of income per se simply by the employment of personnel and I have some difficulty in rationalizing the production of income by the happenstance of having profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.392" offset="10749492">I'm not trying to say that the three-factor formula or two-factor formula would be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.140" offset="10768509">All I'm simply trying to say that it is not so perfect that the District formula is necessarily invalid or so imperfect that it cannot be applied under a situation such as we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.593" offset="10822322">This particular case is fairly close to that Ford Motor Company versus the Beauchamp case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.088" offset="10860251">The tax imposed by Texas in that case was measured by gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.554" offset="10882194">It did not go to net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.565" offset="10890240">It went to capital stocks, surplus and undivided profits of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.613" offset="10910407">But that was simply a selection of elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.069" offset="10932245">Underwood Typewriter, again, a single factor formula based on property happens to have the two kinds of property, tangible, personal or rather personal property and real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.931" offset="10987624">But apparently, it was not conceived in either of these two cases that the apportionment of income based on a selection of a factor or if you will in the case of Underwood, the two factors of personal property and real property rendered the apportionment invalid to the contrary that the apportionment was held entirely reasonable, has bearing a relationship to the activities of the company within the taxing jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.142" offset="11124506">I believe that an analysis of the district's taxing statute clearly demonstrates that it was the intention of the Congress to tax income derived from sales of personal property in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.631" offset="11214472">As a matter of fact, after the Act was passed in 1947, the Congress in 1948 went to particular page to prohibit the District of Columbia from taxing corporations or incorporated businesses engaged in making sales of personal property when those corporations or businesses did not maintain within the District of Columbia an office for the transaction of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.548" offset="11338188">The Congress was also at a particular page to prohibit the District of Columbia from taxing the income derived from sales of personal property to the United States where the property was delivered from places outside, for use outside or for some sources outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.507" offset="11409972">Now, in that area, it is quite clear that the Congress was dealing with income derived from sales because it said the District shall not tax that income as income from the District of Columbia sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.817" offset="11463262">It wasn't talking about manufacturing plans or payroll expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.867" offset="11479458">It was talking about income derived from sales of personal tangible property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.076" offset="11508297">Thus, the Congress' concept of what it was doing here was that it was imposing a tax, there are many businesses which would be subject to tax but in this area, involving sales of tangible personal property that it was imposing a tax upon the income derived from such sale as a consequence of the business activities of a corporation or other business within the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.763" offset="11607040">Now, if that concept that I've expressed is a correct one and in the district's regulations which relate to the taxation or the determination of apportioned net income which is subject to tax in the case of sales of personal property is a reasonable extension of the District statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.326" offset="11689273">I can't conceive it that it would be otherwise because of the extreme portion which the Congress took in making determinations concerning what the District should tax in the case of sales of personal property and the income derived from such sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.258" offset="11784986">Certainly here, where General Motors have 37 millions of dollars of gross sales of products of all kinds within the District where the District of Columbia taxed not 37 millions of dollars but a portion and only four-tenths of 1% of the total net income of the corporation, it is difficult, I think, to establish over taxation on the part of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.249" offset="11920927">The only way that it could possibly to be done would be upon conjecture and speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.176" offset="11944647">I may say also that General Motors does more than simply sell products in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.478" offset="11973904">It has many, many activities within the District of Columbia which are related to its production facilities and to its sales activities, to the generation of business in futuro, where it maintains offices where which it does not maintain, so far as I'm aware, in other jurisdictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3506.496" offset="14025979">Here, what they have done is to tax 100% of the entire income derived from that segment of the business which consists of manufacturing outside and selling within and the fact that only four-tenths of 1% of our sales are made to District customers has nothing to do with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.616" offset="14102361">That comparison is completely insignificant.</text>
