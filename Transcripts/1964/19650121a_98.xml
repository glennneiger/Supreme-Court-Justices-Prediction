            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="31.982" offset="127896">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.774" offset="143047">This case which is here under writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit brings before the Court the standards which the National Labor Relations Board follows in determining what is an appropriate unit for purposes of collective bargaining by Insurance Agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.314" offset="213159">More specifically the question is whether in selecting as an appropriate unit a single district office of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, the Board violated Section 9 (c) (5) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.201" offset="292780">That is a section that was added to the statute in 1947 and states that in selecting the appropriate unit the Board shall not treat the extent to which the employees have organized as controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.644" offset="354534">The Court of Appeals in this case held that the Board in selecting this unit had violated that standard, not as we read the opinion because it was anything in the Board's decision in this case to show that it had treated the extent of organization as controlling but because of the fact that in six other cases also involving the selection of appropriate units for Insurance Agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.237" offset="464875">In each case, the unit which the Board ultimately selected in some instances a single district office and other instances I shall explain a combination of offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.902" offset="507507">In each case, the unit which the Board selected as appropriate was the same unit that the union had requested and the Court of Appeals stated it was unable to reconcile this conflicting decisions of the Board and it therefore drew the inference that in all of these cases including this one, the thing that had controlled the Board's selection of the appropriate unit was the extent of organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.976" offset="619833">Now, our position is this, we think we can show and I'll attempt to show that in selecting this particular unit, that is a single district office, the Board applied its settled principles which it had consistently applied in various fields in selecting appropriate units.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.000" offset="699977">But there was no abuse of discretion in so doing that its various decisions dealing with insurance agents are consistent and all of these come down basically to the question of statutory interpretation which is what does it meant when -- if the Congress says that the extent of organization shall not be controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.384" offset="777509">We say all that it meant was that the Board could not base its decision solely on the fact of extent of organization but the Board may in deciding these questions consider the extent of organization.</text>

            <label>Justice Arthur J. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="207.702" offset="830798">Mr. Friedman, did it mean it is something underlying and that is a sense of the Congress that the Board in decision-making prior to that time is following a practice which the Congress did not approved?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="221.619" stopTime="473.330">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="221.619" offset="886387">I -- I think that's right Mr. Justice and as I will develop, we think the legislative history shows that despite this limitation nevertheless the Congress did recognized that the Board could select small units if they were appropriate under the standard criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.184" offset="944692">I'd like to just mention before coming to the facts that this decision of the Court of Appeals of the First Circuit is contrary to the decisions of three other circuits, each of which has upheld a Board determination of this appropriate unit on the same basis that the Board went on in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.325" offset="1021283">Now, there's no basic dispute over the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.199" offset="1036748">The record which is before the Court has read a long document consist primarily of the record in another case involving the selection of appropriate units in Delaware and the facts developed in that case relate to the general operation of the company and I -- whereby stipulation included in the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.513" offset="1125982">The company sells insurance throughout the United States and Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.438" offset="1145731">Its operations admittedly are very highly centralized in the main office of the company in New York City and in the main office under the main office procedures very detailed standards and methods of operation are provided, the company details in great specificity just how the business is to be conducted at the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.151" offset="1236532">The company for operational purposes divides its business into 14 large territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.818" offset="1263177">Each of which includes a number of states and each of which is under the direct supervision of a company official called the superintendent of agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.601" offset="1302361">Now, within each one of these 14 territorial districts there are in turn a large number of district offices and it is to the district offices to which the individual agents who sell the insurance are attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.950" offset="1359726">The particular office with which we're here dealing in Woonsocket, Rhode Island is in the company's New England territory which embraces five states and the State of Rhode Island itself has eight district offices and this particular district office employs 23 agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.982" offset="1427853">Each of the district offices of the company is under the supervision of a district manager who may have one or more assistants.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.696" offset="1458782">And the district manager in turn is directly responsible to the superintendent of agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.535" offset="1478113">In other words, the chain of command within this company is from the superintendent of agencies in the main office in New York directly to the district manager at the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.817" offset="1519177">As the vice-president of the company explained, he characterize, he says the district manager is the chief executive in his particular district.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.213" offset="1556793">And this man as the chief executive has immediate supervisory authority over all the agents in his district.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.288" offset="1589081">The actual hiring of the agents is done by the home office but the responsibility for recruiting new agents is placed upon the district manager and it's up to the district manager to solicit applicants for openings as they arise and if he finds a man is suitable and sends -- and sends the recommendation forward to the home office and the record shows that approximately three quarters of his recommendations are accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.373" offset="1693466">When a new agent is selected, he gets his initial training for two weeks period in the home office and then he reports to his district where he undergoes further training both in the office and in the field under the supervision of the district director and more -- manager and more directly under the assistant manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.359" offset="1769430">The manager among other things regularly reviews the agent's performance and although he has no power to fire just like his power to hire, he may recommend to the home office that the agent be fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.153" offset="1824601">The evidence shows that there is virtually no shifting of agents from one office to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.706" offset="1842782">It's very little almost no transfer at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.195" offset="1852709">The agents generally go to one office and they stay there.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.377" offset="1865456">And in addition to that, there are no businesses or social contacts among agents except at the particular office level.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.955" offset="1935778">When the Court rose, I was pointing out that within the district there is virtually no social or business contact except -- I'm sorry, except within the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.818" offset="1975171">The agents generally do not have any social business contacts among the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.430" offset="1993665">And it's just one other fact I'd like to emphasize which is that when an agency becomes vacant and they -- they use the word ‘agency' to mean the particular group of customers that an agent has.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.208" offset="2040790">When an agency in a particular district becomes vacant only the agents in that particular district under the company practice are illegible to bid to get that agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="809.681" offset="3238661">The Board in the Wilmington case concluded that the individual district office of the company is in effect a separate administrative unit through which the company conducts its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.695" offset="3290697">And they of course said it was inherently appropriate for purposes of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.637" offset="3310446">It then went on to say that the fact that the particular unit the particular single district is inherently appropriate doesn't mean that a combination would be inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.080" offset="3352242">And in the Wilmington case, it selected as an appropriate unit, the two district offices that the company had in the City of Wilmington, Delaware and it exclude a third district office which is located in Delaware, Delaware approximately 46 miles away from the City of Wilmington.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.884" offset="3439491">And as we interpret the Board's statement at page 15 (a) of the record Mr. Justice Goldberg to which you referred all that they are saying there is, well, they say that since there is no recent history of collective bargaining, no unions seeking a larger unit and the district office sought is located in a separate and distinct geographical area, what they are really saying is that this case therefore, is an appropriate one to apply the basic principle announced in Wilmington that a single district office is inherently an appropriate unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.969" offset="3575850">That's what they said here.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.990" offset="3579925">There was no and as the Board explained that the Board has often taken the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.105" offset="3600405">And that when a union comes in and asks for a unit that is inherently appropriate the union -- there is no reason why the union should be required to operate and try to organize employees collectively in a larger unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.307" offset="3665189">And this -- this it seems to us is illustrated in these cases that what I like to come to what the Board does.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.558" offset="3694132">The Board has basically two approaches here.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.618" offset="3710433">When a single district office is sought and the union asked for a single district office the Board treats that as inherently appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.550" offset="3750139">When the union asked for a combination of district offices the Board will grant that combination provided there is a degree, a reasonable degree of geographic coherence in the unit that it is sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.286" offset="3805100">That is in some instances it may be the city itself, in other instances it may be broader, it may be the Metropolitan area.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.350" offset="3833313">Well, the question maybe is what kind of a unit would not be considered appropriate in the insurance industry?</text>
            <text syncTime="964.117" offset="3856405">Well, I think I could give the Court a very clear illustration of that which is the Wilmington case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.466" offset="3877825">The Board treated the two district offices in Wilmington as appropriate because they were physically in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.554" offset="3906142">Now, if the union had come in and said it wanted a unit composed of just one of those two districts in Wilmington plus the office in Dover, 46 miles away, I think this is a case where the Board would say those are not -- do not have sufficient connection in geographical contiguity to make them a separate unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.373" offset="3985450">And we think -- we think there is nothing in the statute that was looking at the purpose of it that prohibits the Board from doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.889" offset="4007497">And I like to turn to the statute which is set forth on page 30 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.061" offset="4028186">Now, the basic statutory provision is Section 9 (b) which defines the Board's authority to select the appropriate unit and then I would admit when it come to the modifications in that which Section 9 (c) (5) provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.783" offset="4091089">Section 9 (b) says that the Board shall decide in each case whether in order to assure through employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed by this Act, the unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining shall be the employer unit, craft unit, plant unit, was subdivision thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.563" offset="4174158">In other words this statute makes it clear that you don't define an appropriate unit in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.867" offset="4195370">You define what unit is appropriate in terms of the basic policy for which units are designated, that is in order to assure the employees the fullest freedom in exercising the rights guaranteed under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.995" offset="4247928">And indeed 9 (c) (5) specifically recognizes that that is the purpose for which appropriate units are to be selected because it says, in determining whether a unit is appropriate for the purposes specified in subsection (b) that is coming back to repeating to assure the employees the fullest freedom in the exercise of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.612" offset="4330371">The extent to which the employees have organized shall not be controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.896" offset="4347507">Now, just what was the Congress find to get out of this provision and just what limitations does this provision put upon the Board's power to establish appropriate units.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.524" offset="4398080">Prior to 1947, there had been a number of Board decisions including many in the insurance field in which the Board had created small units, primarily on the ground that if the employees were required to wait until there have been organization on a broader basis the effect of that would be to deny this particular group of employees their rights to collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.167" offset="4508630">It's safe to say that so explicitly the Court to frequently uphold these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.193" offset="4528692">In other words these were cases basically in which under the Board's traditional unit criteria you could not sustain them weren't not for the fact that this is what the employees were seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.562" offset="4582191">And it was this practice that Congress wished to put a hold to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.752" offset="4602984">In other words, to prevent the Board from selecting an appropriate unit solely because this was the extent to which the employees had been organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.562" offset="4650214">But we think the legislative history makes it very clear that Congress did not intend to prevent the Board from giving effect to the extent of organization only to prevent the Board from treating it as controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.807" offset="4711131">The opponents of the legislation criticized this provision because they said that it would prevent among other things the organization of insurance companies and other firms which are organized on a scattered basis which have widely dispersed operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.824" offset="4795246">And Senator Taft explained why the effect of the statute would not be that and we've set out at page 13 of our brief a rather lengthy quotation which is from the supplementary analysis that Senator Taft made of the bill six days after it had been passed and to put them in Congressional records and I just like to read two or three sentences because we think it plainly indicates that what the Board is doing in these insurance cases is not something that 9 (c) (5) was intended to prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.468" offset="4937770">And Senator Taft stated, opponents of the bill have stated that it prevent the establishment of smaller operational units and effectively prevents organization of public utilities, insurance companies and other businesses who's operations are widespread.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.253" offset="5008927">It is sufficient answer to say that the Board has evolved numerous tests to determine appropriate units and he goes on and list these tests, community of interest of employees involved, extent of common supervision, interchange of employees, geographical consideration, etcetera, anyone of which may justify the finding of a small unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.217" offset="5096803">I may just afford here for a minute to say that these various tests which are the test that the Board has had applied in the past and still applying it seems to me are clearly met by the selection of this particular district in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1940.573" offset="7762233">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.334" offset="7781251">I think the discussion up to this point would lead to this comment as to the nature of the question presented here for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.909" offset="7819598">I believe that in this case particularly when we're dealing with the statute of this nature which prohibits certain kinds of conduct on the part of the Board it is perfectly obvious that the Board if it should ever violate the statute would never say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.630" offset="7886472">And my friend has been arguing constantly that this Court should in effect be bound by what the Board said in justification of its decisions both with respect to what it calls a single administrative entity and with respect to the other doctrine of geographic coherence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.852" offset="7971318">I submit that on the record of these cases where in every single interest -- every single instance and every case involving this company the Board has found appropriate a unit which is precisely the unit which has been asked for by the union and exactly coextensive with the extent of union's -- the union's organization at that time this Court will very properly look at the results of what the Board has actually done and not be bound by certain assertions made by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.260" offset="8132963">Now, with respect to the assertions here, I think we can get those very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.401" offset="8153548">Mr. Friedman argues that all the Board did in these cases was to apply settled established principles of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.998" offset="8191896">We say that we can demonstrate very shortly that that is absolutely not the fact, it is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.342" offset="8217287">He says further that the Board applied its doctrine coherently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.541" offset="8246126">A quick review of the facts which I will come to in a moment will demonstrate the most irrational kind of diversity with respect to all of the units found by this Board tailored to fit the union's request and the only constant fact to Your Honors which appears throughout everyone of these cases and there is only one single factor which is constant or the common denominator for all and that is the union's request and the limited extent to which the union has organized the employees at that particular time when its request is made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2118.159" offset="8472555">That's this case but this case has another factor in it, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.790" offset="8487079">This case also has in it if the factor that the Board rejected the company's request for the inclusion of seven other offices which the union had sought unsuccessfully to organize all or which were located in the Metropolitan area of Providence, Rhode Island and it rejected that because the nearest office was 12 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.510" offset="8581956">When I come to review the facts very briefly, the fact is that the farthest office was only 24 miles away when in fact in other cases in adopting its so-called Metropolitan area concept flowing from its geographic coherence doctrine, the Board included units which were 30 miles away, offices which are -- and detached offices and I'll come to that in a moment which are as far as 284 miles away and of course when we get to Chicago that is the most revealing of the consistency of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.120" offset="8708389">It shows so plainly how the Board jumped from failure to post in order to accommodate the extent of union of organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.082" offset="8740258">Now, I don't want to get into the facts nor do I have time to get into the facts with respect to the organization and the operation of a company and its administrative subdivisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.887" offset="8779546">All I think I need to point out here Your Honor is this, in every case despite the argument of my friend where every single factor with respect to the administration of the company, its operation and its control was absolutely identical with the facts upon which the Board has ruled in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.836" offset="8867318">The Board over the years has repeatedly and uniformly held that these single district office units and citywide units were completely inappropriate except on the basis of the limited extent of the union's organization and if Your Honors will look at page 16 of my brief but I will not quote from, you will see contrary to what my friend has said that the only way those cases can possibly be read is to be read when the word -- Board uses the word ‘solely' on the basis of extent of organization controllingly on the basis of extent of organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.813" offset="9027187">The Board had all of these criteria well developed at the time it was deciding these cases and yet in every single one of them before they adopted the statewide rule in 1944 it held unequivocally that the only possible basis on the basis of Board test for establishing such units that was the extent of organization and as recently as 1959 one of the Board members who constitutes the present majority of this Board member, Fanning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.291" offset="9141081">In the light of Virginia case who disagreed with its colleagues and that he wanted the statewide rule which had been established in 1944 set-aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.154" offset="9188519">Mr. Fanning analyzed the basic criteria or standards of the Board to be applied in unit cases and he found in that case as recently as 1959 that a single district office couldn't conceivably fit within any of -- it couldn't qualify rather within any of the normal criteria of the Board and I think the asset test here is really what made a single district office inappropriate in the earlier and what factor has so changed as to make it appropriate today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.226" offset="9348807">Now the Board's entire argument rests on the assertion of two criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.744" offset="9370958">One is the criteria of the administrative entity which is inherently appropriate for collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.325" offset="9413277">Now, a member, Fanning in 1959 took the Board's administrative division test which is a normal test which the Board has applied for many years and he said, the administrative structure as the Board has used that term in every case over the years until this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.423" offset="9477642">The administrative structure is a grouping of a company's administrative operation which consists in turn of a group of many small units and where the effect of authority and control is vested in this administrative division like the territorial divisions in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.623" offset="9554442">Never has this Board defined administrative entity or administrative structure and it's a criterion which is used repeatedly over the years to apply to one of a group of small units within a larger unit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2425.926" offset="9703654">Our problem here is to determine whether the union violates or whether the Board has violated Section 9 (c) (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.385" offset="9729463">We have contended before the Board that in our view, in the insurance industry, the three possible appropriate units by reasons of the very peculiar nature of this industry which is totally different in its operations than any other would be the statewide unit which is justified not on the extent of organization but on the Board's own decisions by reason of the fact that every insurance company including this company is very strictly regulated on a state by state basis, its agents are licensed on a state by state basis and in earlier cases years ago before the Board adopted the statewide rule as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.611" offset="9898423">It did find state units appropriate on the basis of state regulation more than that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Burton A. Zorn</label>
            <text syncTime="2484.378" offset="9937502">Well, if the Board had adopted a criterion of the method of regulation of an industry it might have been a fair criterion, I don't know but beyond that Mr. Justice Goldberg I think another criteria in which it might well apply to the state unit and applies in this case is that there has been both in this industry and there has been in this company successful history of collective bargaining on a state by state basis and history of bargaining as you well know of course is a factor of some importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.052" offset="10056202">So I say a approximate extent of organization, a statewide unit might be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.302" offset="10073130">Obviously, a territorial wide unit conforming to the real supervision and control because what has been said here about the extent of authority of a manager is minuscule already it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.855" offset="10127360">If you look at this record you'll see there's nothing to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.940" offset="10139690">That, a territorial unit I think would be appropriate and obviously a companywide unit is appropriate and the two major competitors of this company do bargain on a companywide basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2589.015" offset="10355984">Now, had they -- now, it's conceivable, Justice Goldberg, that on the appropriate record a Metropolitan grouping of district offices could be found to be appropriate because at least there the Board has and we're now talking about established and settled criteria on which the Board rest its case here because there the Board over the years has grouped in a retail industry has grouped a series of stores on a Metropolitan basis on the theory of economic integration on the community and so on that might be an inappropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2654.924" offset="10619611">This case is a 1962 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.805" offset="10631210">Late in December of 1962 or September of 1962, the Board then proceeded to apply to reverse its policies in the retail food chain industry and then to Sav-on-Drugs case held, they didn't used the term separate administrative entity which is essentially a verbalism could cover anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.722" offset="10722847">They said there in effect that they wanted to change their policy to make it easier for store employees to organize and therefore, they held for the first time that a single retail store was appropriate but that came after a series of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.479" offset="10793900">And very recently they've gone a step further and carved contrary to their own rules in the recent -- the department store case, Allied Stores case contrary to the set of rule that a store or department storewide unit except for possible prepped carvings, the department storewide unit could now be separated into selling, none selling and restaurant with the same union petitioning for three separate unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.847" offset="10903301">So, the Board has been moving in change of policy very rapidly in this overall area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.807" offset="10923154">I'd like to get back for a moment, if I may, just to some of the facts here which I think are sufficiently startling that I think they will convince this Court that regardless of what the Board has said here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.732" offset="10978847">It was not applying its criteria consistently nor was it applying an established or settled criteria because in this case as I've pointed out the seven other officers were excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.346" offset="11029316">This case, however, happened to be the fifth in the series of Metropolitan cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.689" offset="11046661">The first involved Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.984" offset="11055856">In Cleveland the Board said, that is the Board majority because there were two member dissents running through all of these cases and the dissents were based on proposition that in the view of the expert two Board members the Board was following the extent of organization -- that extent of organization was controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.148" offset="11120536">But in Cleveland adopting first this so called administrative entity inherently appropriate doctrine which is never used before and which equally could've -- we applied to divide a department store not into three divisions but in a several hundred separate departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.300" offset="11185110">The Board said “First, this is a separate administrative entity; second, because of cogent geographically reasons we will include all because the union asked for it, we will include the officers in the city and the officers in the suburbs in one unit even though there the distance was 18 miles.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.137" offset="11268493">The next case was the Wilmington case where they combined the two in the Metropolitan area of Wilmington on the same theory and rejected the company's request for the inclusion of the Dover office 46 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.335" offset="11321260">Mr. Friedman says the Board never would've included it even if the union had requested it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2838.172" offset="11352607">The third was the Sioux City case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.495" offset="11357936">Let me say a word about detached offices, in Sioux City, detached offices were in two different states, North Dakota and South Dakota, the district office was in Sioux City Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.578" offset="11402240">In that case the Board included all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.444" offset="11425750">Now, a detached office on the reasoning of the Board that the manager of a district office is the immediate supervisory authority over the employees, that applies equally to a detached office case because with this distances apart it is the assistant manager who is the immediate supervisory authority and the record discloses that this virtually know, alright, the most only some occasional contact between the district office and the detached office and far more contract -- contact as a matter of fact from the super intent of agency and his assistance than there ever is, with the manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.837" offset="11555318">In any event the fifth of them was this case, but then we came to Chicago and that I think as I said is the most revealing of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.418" offset="11585620">Here, the Board on this geographic coherence test has adopted what the regional director in Chicago thought was a test that you want to follow.</text>

            <text syncTime="2911.471" offset="11645806">The regional director following what he thinks the Board has said includes not only the offices in the City of Chicago but the suburban offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.557" offset="11686139">There were 33 of them in the city and 14 in the suburb.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.147" offset="11700558">But “No” says the Board when a case comes before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.810" offset="11723233">We are going to exclude all of the suburban offices and we're going to exclude them for the following reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.260" offset="11765029">That upon the physical location of the individual offices as the yardstick in determining the appropriate geographic appropriateness of the unit when in fact six of the city office had territories extending in those suburbs, three of the suburban offices had territories extending into the city and there was no more than a distance of six blocks between one city office and one suburban office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.168" offset="11876624">So, the Metropolitan union cons -- Metropolitan area concept goes out of the window and what this concept are physical yardstick can possibly mean I leave to Your Honors' imagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.927" offset="11931690">Following that without going in anymore detail that's all covered in our brief, I want to say that in 22 of the other cases in which the Board has -- has held appropriately a single district office in at least ten of them the distance between the office certified and the nearest office was less than five miles, in some cases only one or two miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.772" offset="12031060">Now, I need to spend very little time and I don't know how much time I do have left on the question of the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.214" offset="12060839">The purpose of the statute is plain, it was intended to reverse a practice which the Board had engaged in, in this industry and other industries of forming units based on the extent of organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.715" offset="12110785">Now, whether you argue that it sole or controlling I think our brief covers that sufficiently and I think for purposes of this case it makes very little difference because our position here is that the test which the Board claims to have set up first with respect to this that single administrative entity are not valid test nor are they test which the Board has ever applied before and never in any situation applied before and when it comes to the application of those test and the geographic coherence test I think you'd arrive at one simple conclusion that you can't possibly explain this irrationality and inconsistency of decision except on the basic ground of the one factor which is common and constant through all of these cases and that is the factor of the extent to which the Union has organized at that particular time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3966.733" offset="15866880">And the Board in every case makes a finding that whatever unit it decides is appropriate for collective bargaining and my only thought on your question is simply this, that the Board has a right and a duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.695" offset="15922678">Not only to consider desires of employees which is precisely what Congress outlaw in 1947 that it also has a duty to consider which unit aside from the desires of the employees is a unit that will effectuate successful collective bargaining and that is the other branch of its obligation.</text>
