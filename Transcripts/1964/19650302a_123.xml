            <text syncTime="44.785" offset="179096">This case comes here on petition of the Federal Power Commission and presents a rather basic issue as to the scope of the Commission's licensing jurisdiction over hydroelectric projects one which calls for a construction of Section 23 (b) of the Water Power Act of 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.938" offset="283690">In that Section Congress used the language common to so many federal regulatory statutes affecting interstate or foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.161" offset="336562">Our question here is whether it did so in a specialized or limiting sense or whether on the contrary the concept of affecting commerce is to be given its customary full play.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.961" offset="423811">The Eighth Circuit has held as respondent Union Electric Company here urges that the word commerce in this statute is to be read but although other statute does not say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.160" offset="484624">As if it referred solely to commerce on the river only that and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.984" offset="523912">Our view is that Congress quite purposefully in the Water Power Act exercised the full scope of its constitutional commerce powers and that it imposed a licensing requirement as well as the other regulatory incidents of the Act upon any hydroelectric project which would affect commerce in the constitutional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.668" offset="638642">Now I shall deal with the facts more fully in a few moments but I would like to make a few essentials clear at the outset.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.726" offset="694857">The Hydroelectric project in question is known as the Taum Sauk Project and it is located on a non-navigable stream in Missouri known as the East Fork.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.107" offset="752327">The East Fork River is some 4 miles of the location of the project on the East Fork is some 4 miles above the confluence of that stream with the Black River which is a navigable river.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.790" offset="823066">Now there is dispute as to whether the facts justify the conclusion that the Taum Sauk Project will significantly affect downstream navigability on the Black River.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.319" offset="893179">The trial examiner and the Commission concluded that it would the Court of Appeals disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.166" offset="920660">There is no dispute however, no dispute on the proposition that electricity which is generated at the Taum Sauk works will serve Union Electric's coordinated three-state system of generation transmission and distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.863" offset="1003416">The Taum Sauk Project will draw upon sources of energy and other states at certain times and at other times the Taum Sauk Project will generate hydroelectric Power which will be transmitted to other states.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.439" offset="1117727">This record shows a three-state integrated system.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.188" offset="1132669">It does not show whether the system also has arrangements for interchanged with the facilities and other parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.233" offset="1176869">Now the principal legal issue which the Government brought here is whether a hydroelectric project defects commerce in a statutory sense where project energy will flow in Interstate Commerce even if it be assumed that it will not affect -- the project will not affect the navigable capacity of the river or the mainstream of which the river is tributary.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.188" offset="1300689">A secondary issue, I've already indicated I think and that is whether on the established facts, the Court of Appeals should have rejected the Commission's conclusion that the project would affect the navigable capacity of the Black River and then not on that impendent ground that require a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.927" offset="1391700">Now, I referred passingly to the statutory language, let me turn if I may to the precise provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.213" offset="1420852">Section 23 (b) appears that pages 2 and 3 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.868" offset="1451468">You will find that it is one long paragraph analytically I think it may be broken down into two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.708" offset="1482815">The opening sentence the first part says in substance that it shall be unlawful for any person to construct or to operate any dam, water conduit, reservoir, powerhouse or other works along or in any navigable water of the United States for the purpose of developing electric power without a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.656" offset="1602560">You will note that this licensing requirement applies irrespective of whether the works constructed would actually impair navigation or have any demonstrable effect upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.560" offset="1666194">Now, the next segment beginning with the second sentence deals with the matter of placing such works in a non-navigable stream as the statute puts it in any stream or part thereof other than those defined herein as navigable waters and over which Congress has jurisdiction under its authority to regulate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.450" offset="1773714">A person so proposing the statute continues shall file a declaration of intention with the Committee at which point the Commission fell immediately investigate the proposed construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.159" offset="1832542">Then the language which is crucial for present purposes, if the Commission finds that "the interest of interstate and foreign commerce would be affected", the construction is forbidden unless and until a license is sought and obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.070" offset="1928255">Now, in those words of broad sweep protecting the interest of interstate commerce there is surely no intimation that the Commission was to be confined either then or for all time to an appraisal of the effect upon commerce on the river.</text>

            <text syncTime="699.575" offset="2798237">And this I think suggests that Congress meant to give the Federal Commission jurisdiction overall projects, say, those which would have purely local effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.937" offset="2847660">And Congress has expressed delegation of authority over those local projects to the states suggests further that Congress regarded its own power as extending to the entire watershed of the river which was certainly not a niggardly conception of the commerce power or one which suggest any intent on Congress' part to invoke anything less than the full measure of its authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.916" offset="2971585">Now, it maybe a source of some surprise that a statutory question as basic as this one has not been laid to rest previously the statute having passed some 40 odd years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.677" offset="3034697">The reason for that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.352" offset="3049326">Under the State of New York in 1920 and indeed until very recently hydroelectric generation of power was confined to harnessing the natural fall of the river or flow of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.818" offset="3119229">More over projects which reduced energy in sufficient quantity to serve interstate markets were almost invariably located on navigable streams or its situated on a tributary would impound enough water to affect substantially the navigability of the main stream so that virtually any project of the conventional type which was large enough to have a significant effect on the interest of commerce was subject -- well, I should say large enough so that it would have an effect on the interest of commerce with subject to jurisdiction because it would certainly affect downstream navigable capacity regardless of whether it affected commerce in any other sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.554" offset="3346181">Now, in the istant case the Commission dealt with the prototype of a new kind of hydroelectric project.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.762" offset="3382962">One which is going to become more and more familiar as time goes on and will undoubtedly play an increasing role in meeting the country's massive and accelerating energy requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.916" offset="3451611">The Taum Sauk project is a so-called pumped storage project, the first pure pump storage project in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.313" offset="3501244">By their nature pump storage projects as opposed to the conventional hydroelectric project are aught to have far less impact upon downstream commerce on the river or downstream navigable capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.297" offset="3573133">Now pump storage very simply stated involves the creation of a man-made waterfall, water is pumped up from river level to a high hill or a mountain.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.581" offset="3646276">There the water is stored and in an appropriate time released.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.966" offset="3671771">It falls from this upper high altitude pool back into a lower pool in the river which is formed by a dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.485" offset="3725897">The pumps which force the water upwards during the (Inaudible) -- pumping cycle are reversible and serve as turbines during the downward cycle.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.201" offset="3780754">In short, the pump storage is like a huge storage battery.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.703" offset="3806772">During hours when demand is slack on Union Electric system which would characteristically be the night time hours, Taum Suak project draws energy from other generating facilities and Union Electric System from steam facility, steam generating facilities and uses that energy to pump the water up the hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.350" offset="3917322">Conversely, during periods when demand upon the system is heavy during the peak hours the water can be released from the upper reservoir and hydropower generated at the Taum Sauk.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.225" offset="3988898">Although it requires more energy to pump the water up the hill than is obtained from letting it fall back into the river, projects of this kind provide a great assist to integrated electric systems because of the very wide variation in demand as between the peak and the off peak periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.499" offset="4085969">Now this new technique of developing additional sources of energy has made it possible for tributaries with relatively small stream flows to produce hydroelectric energy in quantities which were previously obtainable only from large hydro plants on mainstreams or their important tributaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.190" offset="4196728">The Taum Sauk project itself is one of very considerable magnitude.</text>

            <text syncTime="1732.192" offset="6928718">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.942" offset="6943765">Now, I think that the -- what I have called the burden of respondent to justify writing a caveat into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.214" offset="6980754">I don't think it can be sustained either by reference to the underlying historic purposes of this Act or by reference to the specific history of 23 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.986" offset="7031850">Now this statute as Your Honors know was not passed merely to deal with matters involving obstruction or impairment of navigation, subjects with which Congress have previously dealt in the Rivers and Harbors Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.218" offset="7088797">From first to last, this statute was the work of the conservationist block in Congress which struggled for its enactment for a period of almost 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.174" offset="7132682">It is a Water Power Act and not a Navigation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.318" offset="7149192">The beginnings go back to President Theodore Roosevelt's famous veto message in the Rainy River matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.035" offset="7184091">Prophetically he stated at that time that the country was on the eve of great developments in water power and he urged -- that an administrative authority be created to pass upon plans for river projects and to assure for future generations a complete development of the limited sites, a complete development of the power possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.246" offset="7288895">Those who took up the task of enacting a Water Power Act, Gifford Pinchot, Henry Stimson, Robert La Follette and others unfailingly stressed the same theme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.111" offset="7340408">And as Your Honors know, the statute which ultimately emerged specifically charges the Commission in exercising it's licensing and its investigatory functions to conserve and utilize the water resources of the nation for navigation, power development, recreation and all other beneficial uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.925" offset="7443644">In the similar vein the statute directs the Commission not to approve of private development if in its judgment the United States in the public interest should undertake the development of the particular site.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.475" offset="7501845">Now all of this has been said before in the Court's opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.967" offset="7519817">I think Justice Burton said it as sharply as anyone in his first Iowa opinion which we've quoted in the -- which I'd like to quote one sentence from.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.814" offset="7575197">We've set it out 20 -- page 21 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.665" offset="7590557">He speaks of the Water Power Act as the outgrowth of a widely supported effort of the conservationists to secure enactment of a complete scheme of National Regulation which would promote the comprehensive development of the water resources of the nation insofar as it was within the reach of the Federal Power to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.629" offset="7686478">Now, I'm not suggesting, arching back to the question Mr. Justice Harlan raised earlier that Congress in 1920 conceived the projects like the present one and consciously decided to cover them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.155" offset="7760562">I am not saying that Congress in that year conceived of the commerce power as we think of it today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.137" offset="7784490">Surely, it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.752" offset="7798909">Only two years earlier in 1918 this Court had held the Federal Child Labor Act unconstitutional in Hammer against Dagenhart principally on the theory that manufacturing in commerce were wholly separable concepts and that commerce in essence meant no more than transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.709" offset="7894831">And we acknowledge that numerous members of the Congress which passed the Water Power Act tended to equate commerce and navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.134" offset="7944464">Our point however is that Congress did not attempt to define commerce here by any words of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.038" offset="7976124">On the contrary we think that the history of the measures which culminated in this Act show that Congress was doing everything that it thought itself constitutionally empowered to do in the interest of controlling the water resources of their nation -- of the nation and of promoting their optimum utilization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.339" offset="8073300">In other words this is not a situation if I may borrow from another of court's opinions in which Congress chose to freeze the operation of a statute within the mold of the then current judicial decisions defining the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.261" offset="8156996">Now I've spoken of the statutes broad objectives and of the congressional design as we see it to exhaust the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.590" offset="8198269">There is also a specific history of Section 23 (b) which supports our view, a predecessor bill similar in most of its Sections have been before Congress in 1919, a filibuster in which Senator La Follette figured prominently killed that bill in the closing hours of the 65th Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.554" offset="8322194">In this predecessor bill the provision granting the Commission licensing jurisdiction over a project on a non-navigable stream was more confining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.527" offset="8386038">In substance the Commission was told by the language of that bill to determine whether the project would affect navigation in interstate or foreign commerce rather than the interests of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.862" offset="8467435">I am not arguing that this particular provision was the cause of the filibuster.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.481" offset="8497842">Senator Lafollete's primary objection is deterrent rested on quite another point what he regarded in the 1919 bill as an unduly def -- unduly narrow definition of navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.161" offset="8552594">He feared that the definition of navigable waters in that bill would not include shoals or waterfalls which of course are a particular importance from the power standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.554" offset="8602122">To continue with our story of the history in the next session of Congress the provision which is now Section 23 (b) came out of the House in precisely the same form as it had taken in the 1919 Bill that is to say, jurisdiction under non-navigable rivers turned upon a finding that navigation will be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.243" offset="8716957">It was changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.841" offset="8723331">It was changed by the Senate Committee which eliminated the reference to navigation and substituting in its place the words, the interests of interstate and far -- or foreign commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="2639.095" offset="10556291">Both the examiner and the Commission concluded on the basis of stipulated facts that under usual and ordinary conditions, the operation of the Taum Sauk Project would not affect the navigable capacity of the Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.040" offset="10632150">However, the examiner found after detailed analysis with which the Commission agreed that when there was a concurrence of certain conditions the project was capable of having a measurable and a pronounced effect upon downstream navigability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.431" offset="10721698">Now, we take it as clear from the cases that the Commission need not find in order to conclude that the interests of navigation would be affected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2728.424" offset="10913646">The examiner pointed out that this had happen on a number of past occasions, as I recall there had been floods in 1949 and in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.802" offset="10959203">When during such a period of high flow or flood a generating cycle has begun in order to meet system needs thus adding to the water in the already swollen lower pool, the full impact of the water stored up there upon the mountain top, the stages of the Black River, the examiner concluded will be appreciably rage downstream.</text>

            <text syncTime="3012.964" offset="12051853">Our answer to that is that licensing is essentially a preventive device.</text>

            <text syncTime="3066.769" offset="12266998">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.030" offset="12300016">Initially I would like to comment very briefly upon a few of the factors that were mentioned in the argument by the Assistant Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.500" offset="12361979">There are two points argued in there in the brief for the Commission, the first one being -- one relating to the construction of the statute which is the ground upon which certiorari was sought and obtained in this Court and the second being the question of whether the court below erred in rejecting the Commission's conclusion that this project would substantially effect -- affect downstream navigability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.100" offset="12504398">We think the second question is not properly before the Court recognizing of course that that's the matter for the Court's discretion but we have pointed out for pertinent facts as to why we think is not here and what the nature of the question presented is which without going into the detail, is a factual question along the first of the two phases of the case to which the brief of the -- or the Commission is largely devoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.383" offset="12641489">I have -- submit these few comments on what was stated in the beginning of the argument in opposition of -- before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.762" offset="12687047">First, this is not a statute which provides or lays as a test whether or not the project will affect interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.456" offset="12741799">Now, that's a vital point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.853" offset="12755383">Throughout their brief we have assumed that although at places they recognized that the language is somewhat different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.967" offset="12791850">What they treated just as any other case, Your Honor mentioned the -- Mr. Justice Goldberg, the Labor Act case, they rely -- Labor Act -- they rely on the cases under that Act which of course does constituted and exercised by the Congress of its broad power over interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.012" offset="12884010">And their old theory and the cases upon which they rely are based upon the essential premise that in this statute Congress exercised its power over interstate commerce generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.661" offset="12966557">I am happy that it's stated that way because that's a precise issue and the one to which we wished to direct our argument as we have directedour brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.227" offset="13012846">This is a Water Power Act and water power is not only power but water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.617" offset="13046387">And what the Congress was dealing with here was affect on waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.426" offset="13073659">And I think it was Mr. Justice Harlan who suggested the question what is the jurisdiction of Congress over non-navigable tributaries of navigable streams and that is a vital question to which we have devoted an important part of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.695" offset="13150772">One other comment that I have wished to make as a preliminary matter is that although this Act was passed through -- in 1920, Federal Water Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.809" offset="13207197">The vital provisions in the Section with which we're concerned, well, I won't say all of the vital provisions but some of the most vital provisions were not put in to the Act until 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.562" offset="13278145">It was then that it was made mandatory rather than discretionary for a company before constructing a project in a non-navigable tributary to file a declaration of intention with the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.187" offset="13344705">Before that it had been discretionary, a company might do it for its own protection and obtain the Commission determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.683" offset="13382635">But in 1935 that was made mandatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3679.279" offset="14717074">A stream of a defined class as I've already said is a stream over which Congress -- a tributary of a navigable water over which Congress has jurisdiction, under its power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="3699.306" offset="14797218">Well, the interest in non-related fields that the statute refers to are the interest relating to this water about which Congress was legislating and exercising its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.605" offset="14850403">Now, the first point we have into the brief is 1 (a), that word -- the jurisdiction of con -- jurisdiction of the streams over which Congress has jurisdiction under his power to regulate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.379" offset="14933473">The Commission decision goes into that in great extent but only to demonstrate that Congresshas jurisdiction, had jurisdiction, of course it have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.400" offset="14981538">That's obvious.</text>

            <text syncTime="3748.852" offset="14995331">This is a tributary of a navigable water and therefore Congress has jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.370" offset="15013407">But, the important question which the Commission did not go into and which the brief of counsel for the Commission does not deal with it as I read it is, what is that jurisdiction?</text>

            <text syncTime="3774.465" offset="15097835">That jurisdiction we see on the authority of uniformed decisions in this Court, that is the jurisdiction to take appropriate measures or to take measures which in the judgment of Congress are appropriate to protect, that is measures with reference to a non-navigable tributary to take measures with reference to that stream or the protection or improvement of navigable water into which the stream flows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.364" offset="15245375">That's our point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.466" offset="15253838">And that's the point that's decisive -- well, it's not self-decisive but it's a principal factor because that term is used in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3826.661" offset="15306606">It's an essential part of the subject matter and it's a thing that must be determined before we know what the statute means.</text>

            <text syncTime="3985.934" offset="15943680">And further on it said it was construing there the -- a section of the River and Harbor Act of 1890 that this -- there was a later one of 1899, this was 1890, which prohibited obstructions in streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.335" offset="16009300">And it said, it would be to improperly ignore the scope of this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.694" offset="16034691">That is the language of a statute to limited -- to acts done within the very limits of navigable -- of navigation of a navigable stream.</text>

            <text syncTime="4200.428" offset="16801646">I think it was very clearly stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis in Arizona against California as I recall and it's been recently pointed out to him the Oklahoma case that I mentioned where there was a so-called multiple purpose project providing water for irrigation and recreation and generation of power and perhaps other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.849" offset="16911360">The constitutional purpose and the thing that made the statute valid is within the power of Congress was that it would improve or protect the navigability of the Red River downstream from the non-navigable part of it in which the project was constructed and of the Mississippi River into which that stream flowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.983" offset="17003833">We have dealt with that in some detail in the brief and I think I'm leaving -- go into -- in detail all in here unless there is a question about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4273.171" offset="17092650">One is the Appalachian case, so-called, that's United States against Appalachian Power Company in which the Government sought to enjoin and did enjoin the construction of a project without a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.171" offset="17184601">There were some language written in -- the language in that opinion which was written by Mr. Justice Reed, we -- upon which they rely and which may superficially seem to depart somewhat from the doctrine enunciated in the Rio Grande cases and others but he -- in fact does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.379" offset="17285433">And he -- the -- what I referred to is this, I may have quoted it and if I may impose Your Honors I can do it more briefly than by describing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.646" offset="17326498">The Court said, "In our view, it cannot properly be said that the constitutional power of Congress over its waters is limited to control for navigation".</text>
            <text syncTime="4346.809" offset="17387207">Oh, that much looks against beyond the -- on the face of it but notice the rest of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.407" offset="17413538">By navigation respondent means no more than operation of boats and improvement of the waterway itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.866" offset="17455438">In truth, the authority of the United States is the regulation of commerce on it's waters and it goes on navigability in the sense you just stated that is by the respondent, limited and "in the improvement of the navigable portion is but a part of this whole flood protection, watershed development, recovery of the cost of improvements through utilization of power or likewise parts of commerce controlling".</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.397" offset="17589499">Now, when that is read, there is not anything in that that's contrary to what I have said.The flood control as pointed out in the Oklahoma case of course, if floods are uncontrolled they'll impair navigation where navigation is possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.126" offset="17660447">And so you may control floods, Congress may, not only on the navigable water but on the headwaters or up to the top of the headwaters to prevent the sources of floods and watershed development falls in the same category as pointed out in the Oklahoma case and in of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4433.643" offset="17734531">Of this power production recovery of the cost, of improvements through utilization of power, that is Your Honors will note -- perhaps recall in the case of Ashwander against Tennessee Valley Authority where that was a principal issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="4455.345" offset="17821362">That was in a navigable stream, a Government building, a dam in a navigable stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.133" offset="17844454">It became a proprietor of the water power, potential water power that was made available and the Court said it needn't waste it, it may use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4470.153" offset="17880607">I don't think that limits it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4472.238" offset="17888862">I don't think it's limited to that precise concept that it may very well be that the Government has a right to provide for generation of power or other reasons or motives than merely that of not wasting the water power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.183" offset="17968692">But the point about it is that it must first have a constitutional purpose which is the improvement or preservation of navigability and that -- unless that's (Inaudible), none of the other things may be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4507.678" offset="18030655">That's the Appalachian case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.764" offset="18039014">The other case upon which they principally rely, and it is mentioned here in argument is the first Iowa case and there's some language in that that stresses the objectives of the conservationists or when that case is read I'm not going to -- I know Your Honors provide any more reading from that but they are on me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.324" offset="18137234">When that case is read, it will be found that what the Court is dealing with there was it contention by the State of Iowa that there must -- be affirmed, that was for a project, I should have said, a project was proposed to be constructed on a river in Iowa which was navigable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4553.554" offset="18214139">I think the -- Cedar River and would affect another river, the Iowa River both of which were navigable streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.820" offset="18247262">The proposed constructor or the company proposing they construct the project applied with the Commission, the Federal Power Commission for a license, contention was made that you -- they first had to get a permit from Iowa under the Iowa law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.961" offset="18311837">And that contention was made in reliance so -- in Section 9 of the Federal Power Act which requires compliance with state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4585.653" offset="18342557">So the Federal Power Commission denied the license solely in order to enable the -- to permit the case to be brought before this Court to determine whether or not the stae of -- a permit from the State of Iowa would be required as a condition of constructing the (Inaudible) -- of obtaining the Federal Power Commission license.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.536" offset="18438060">And in that connection dealing with that contention the Court pointed out that that would be all to give it con -- inconsistent with the purposes of the Act and with the objectives of it which was national control over the water system of a country that affected navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.164" offset="18516637">And that's I think the essence of what's involved in that case and what they quote from it does not in any ways affect the primary fundamental proposition that the jurisdiction of Congress over a non-navigable tributary is the jurisdiction to protect or improve downstream navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.128" offset="18628441">Now, that's a fundamental point and the Section of the statute, Section 23 must be read to the -- question the crucial provisions in which we're interested of course must be read with all of the context but that one -- that element among others -- and fundamentally that element.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.727" offset="18710883">Of the second point I have to make is largely related to that and I may deal with it more briefly and that is the proposition that the other terms in the Section 23 confirm that the idea that this was intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="4708.579" offset="18834286">The interest of interstate commerce referred to in the Section are those related to commerce on the waters, downstream navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.648" offset="18870544">I shan't devote very much attention to that and it's a matter that appeals rather to the -- to the eye then to the ear of -- when you look at the language of the statute with these terms -- the specific terms related to their immediate context, the point appears clear as -- at least it does to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.130" offset="18972421">We've cited out at page 45 of our brief, any person, association or state or municipality and so on intending to construct a dam or other project works.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.166" offset="19044624">Now, project works as defined as physical structures of a project.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.417" offset="19065626">Construct of dam or other project works along, over, across, along, over or in any stream over which Congress has jurisdiction under its commerce power shall file a declaration of intent with the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4784.658" offset="19138560">And if the Commission determines that the proposed construction will affect the interests of interstate or foreign commerce then the construction may not be carried on without a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.766" offset="19207001">Now there are a number of significant terms there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.560" offset="19222152">The word construction of itself is an important one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4809.870" offset="19239393">I don't want to claim too much for that term but I think it certainly implies at least this much that what Congress was driving against there was structure so placed as to affect those waters, construction of a dam or other physical structures across, along, over or in a stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="4837.505" offset="19349943">Obviously, the purpose of that is to deal with what might affect that stream and thereby in turn affect downstream navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4848.681" offset="19394664">At least the language is perfectly consistent with that intent and it would seem by the same token would be inept if what they were intending to do was to prohibit interstate transmission of electricity which has nothing to do with the use -- well, I won't say, nothing to do with the use of the waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.226" offset="19468852">They use water to generate power but it has nothing to do with downstream navigability and that's their point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.559" offset="19506155">They say that this independently of any effect on downstream navigability if you intend to transmit energy from your plant in interstate commerce that it's within the jurisdiction of Congress and under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.493" offset="19569894">So I have -- I've -- we've dealt with that in the brief and it's a matter of detail and I think I need not dwell upon it any further but there are two things that I want to mention.</text>

            <text syncTime="4972.448" offset="19889737">That's where Congress took jurisdiction over transmission of electricity and incidentally as long as the point is of now, in that Section it said, "However, Congress shall have -- however, the Commission shall have no jur -- well, first the Commission shall have jurisdiction over transmission in interstate commerce and over facilities for such transmission but you'll have no jurisdiction over generating facilities except to the extent specifically provided in part 2 and part 3.</text>

            <text syncTime="5177.458" offset="20709773">Now they first said, no one shall (Inaudible) -- construct any project in the navigable water without a license.</text>

            <text syncTime="5727.007" offset="22907925">It's not a new point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5729.339" offset="22917329">What it's -- a confirmation to the point I made about the extent of which -- into which jurisdiction is exercised by Congress in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5739.434" offset="22957662">I have dealt with what the jurisdiction of Congress is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5742.667" offset="22970619">Now, if Your Honors look at the -- this also is a matter that is visually impressive rather than orally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5752.822" offset="23011265">In Appendix C of the brief of the Commission, they've set out the provisions of Section 4 which define the licensing jurisdiction of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5764.882" offset="23059435">And in Section 4 (e) which appears at page 40 of their Appendix A, Page 40 of Appendix A, here is the -- the Commission is hereby authorized and empowered to issue licenses to citizens of the United States and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5782.683" offset="23130697">Now, this probably be skipping down a few lines, for the purpose of constructing, operating and maintaining dams, water conduits, reservoirs powerhouses, transmission lines or other project works.</text>
            <text syncTime="5796.012" offset="23183987">Here's the important part, necessary or convenient for the development and improvement of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5807.564" offset="23230171">It goes on, and for -- notice the word, "and" for the development transmission and utilization of water of power across, along, from or in any of the streams or other bodies of water over which Congress had a jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5824.186" offset="23296731">Later on in that Section it's -- in the second proviso, kind of near at the top of page 41, provided further that no license affecting the navigable capacity of any navigable waters of the United States shall be issued until the plants have been approved by the chief of engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5844.712" offset="23378756">Now that Section as I say it confirms I think the point we made about the jurisdiction of Congress and the jurisdiction it exercised in this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5858.990" offset="23435912">But it also relates to a jurisdiction of a commission and I have no excuse and I'm sorry to say for having the omission of that from the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5869.737" offset="23478857">It should have been put in and I think Your Honors will want to consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5873.858" offset="23495367">In the same connection, I say we have no excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="5879.275" offset="23517100">It was not due to any lack of industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5882.192" offset="23528699">But it was one of those things where you're concentrating on a number of points and here's one that we -- confirmatory of one of our main points and we unfortunately overlooked.</text>
            <text syncTime="5893.466" offset="23573838">Page 42, they set out the provisions of Section 10 upon which they rely on some respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="5900.603" offset="23602364">And that Section deals with the conditions to be put in to licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5905.593" offset="23622322">When the Commission issues a license it shall impose conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5912.264" offset="23648967">The first part of that Section 10 (a) on page 42 of their append -- their brief, part of Appendix C, the first condition is this, if the project adopted including the maps, plans and specification shall be such as in the judgment of the Commission will be and this is the important part, best adapted to a comprehensive plan for improving or developing a waterway or waterways for the use or benefit of interstate or foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5951.442" offset="23805701">And it goes along with other conditions but there's a man - at the end of the second -- last condition and that first one is a mandatory condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5960.683" offset="23842691">And similarly in Section C on paragraph C on the same page 42, of the line, other conditions that the licensee shall maintain the project works in a condition of repair adequate for the purposes of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.737" offset="23918864">That has to go into a license or how would such a condition go into a license here on a non-navigable tributary concededly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5990.727" offset="23962854">If -- it might go in but only in relation to downstream waters which are navigable confirming in my judgment the whole basic theory of our position about it and the position followed by the Court of Appeals in contrary to theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6010.407" offset="24041535">I want to come to another important point unless Your Honors have another question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6015.934" offset="24063687">That's the history of this Act which we rely on and I think if there are any use, the vernacular clincher needed for these points I have been making there in the history of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6031.628" offset="24126485">I don't know about the Act, of the proposed Act of 1919 which never passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6039.034" offset="24156056">I do know about the Act of 1920 which did pass and the -- submitted in the Commission's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.507" offset="24190015">They have cited some instances in which as the they say individual Congressmen expressed the view that Congress had no power except essentially the power I've been trying to delineate here, the power to protect navigable capacity or to improve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6065.494" offset="24261904">But what is important here are not those expressions of -- by individual Congressmen although they're of some importance but the assurance is given by the sponsors of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="6078.402" offset="24313522">And we have set out in Appendix A of our brief which is back at page -- ends at -- Appendix B rather of our brief beginning at page 87, we attempted to make this easy to find by running heads and caption, Appendix B begins at page 87.</text>
            <text syncTime="6097.911" offset="24391576">And there -- well, I've quoted from it that the -- in an earlier part of the brief in page 49.</text>
            <text syncTime="6104.320" offset="24417280">There Senator Nelson who is one of the proponents of the bill and entirely in charge of it in the Senate or one of them was in charge of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6113.898" offset="24455523">I judge from the debates and he was a member of the Senate Delegation that conferred with the House Delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6122.642" offset="24490527">He'd -- he explicitly reaffirmed all that I have said and all that is held in the Rio Grande case saying that the jurisdiction of Congress was limited to what they called feeders that is tributaries of navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="6140.023" offset="24560013">The jurisdiction was never limited to what would affect the downstream waters and assured his fellow Senators who were somewhat apprehensive about an extension of federal power in that respect that he went no farther than that and they were not attempting to interfere with the present situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6158.368" offset="24633469">That's of some importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6160.215" offset="24640784">But a much greater importance in my judgment is the history of the 1935 legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6170.540" offset="24682057">There in 1935 this whole -- the Water Power Act was revised thoroughly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6177.233" offset="24708911">As I have said, Section 23 was amended in four respects, important respects, three of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6184.980" offset="24739840">Parts 2 and 3 were added into the Act and most of that whole bill incorporating those amendments was part 2, Title 2 of the Public Utility Act of 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="6202.271" offset="24809012">And those amendments were sponsored by the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6208.443" offset="24833672">We've set out in Appendix C of the brief -- of our brief the statements made by some of the members of the Commission, the Chairman appeared and tendered the services of the -- his associates and of the Solicitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6222.851" offset="24891350">And then -- I'm only going to mention one or two important things here, Commissioner CV of the Federal Power Commission filed a memorandum which is set out at page 93, set out in -- a part of it relating to Section 210 which is the Section that amended what's now 23 (b), relating to this various section it's involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6249.868" offset="24999393">He set out a memorandum and first referred to the fact that they were incorporating into the Section the provisions prohibiting any unlicensed construction in the navigable stream.</text>

            <text syncTime="6276.874" offset="25107435">He first referred to the fact that they were writing this first sentence of bringing the control over navigable waters into this Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="6284.956" offset="25139722">And then we're making it mandatory to file a declaration of intent -- intention for a construction in non-navigable tributary and then he said contrary to my promise, I'd like to read this if Your Honors will indulge me.</text>
            <text syncTime="6303.258" offset="25212970">Under this Section, has amended every person intending to construct a project which might conceivably affect any navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="6313.794" offset="25255079">Waters would be under the duty coming to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6318.917" offset="25275664">The Act would be greatly strengthened by enabling the Commission to preserve control over all projects with which the Federal Government has any valid concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="6333.347" offset="25333342">The effect of that I think without taking anymore time about it is that the concern of the Federal Government, the valid that concern is protection there and -- improvement of navigable waters and that that's what this Section 23 does.</text>
            <text syncTime="6346.854" offset="25387363">Now that -- my time is very limited I see by my white light here and I want to cover a point if I may here before I close.</text>

            <text syncTime="6370.391" offset="25481509">They had -- they received and accepted that insurance -- assurance and incorporated it in their own reports and no doubt thereby relieved the apprehensions of many members of both Houses of Congress that this Section might carry further.</text>

            <text syncTime="6416.848" offset="25667291">If Your Honors wish to take it -- important to consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6420.939" offset="25683696">That should be taken in.</text>
            <text syncTime="6422.712" offset="25690802">It's of -- it's a factual question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6424.085" offset="25696340">What the court below decided contrary to their appraisal of its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6429.066" offset="25716193">What the court decided was that there was no substantial evidence to support that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6436.052" offset="25744196">That the downstream navigability would be affected, so it's factual.</text>
            <text syncTime="6441.543" offset="25766139">Now on the thing they argued the exact thing they argue and it was argued here orally.</text>
            <text syncTime="6448.957" offset="25795814">They surveyed -- indicate -- in part say that the basis of the Court's decision was that if there should be any untoward effect, it could be corrected later by action under what's called Section 4 (g) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6464.861" offset="25859344">That's the Section that gives the Commission the very broad power of investigation of any project -- any construction in the stream and to correct anything that maybe wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="6475.336" offset="25901244">And to issue such orders as maybe appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6478.241" offset="25912947">Now the Court did point that out by way of a comment to the end of its opinion but not by -- not as the basis of his -- of its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6486.627" offset="25946488">All it said about that was that if in effect -- I'm not quoting, if there should be any change in the future this decision that we're rendering won't bar appropriate commission action.</text>
            <text syncTime="6499.684" offset="25998733">They have full authority under Section 4 (g) to make an investigation and to issue an appropriate order but they've taken that comment by the Court as the basis of the Court's decision which it is not and upon the basis -- upon that theory, they argued here that the -- that Congress and the Commission are not limited to remedial action, to correct an injury that's already been done but may take preventive measures to issue preventive regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6529.802" offset="26119105">But of course they may -- we never disputed that and if that's the question,well, of course it isn't the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6536.955" offset="26147736">But we could know possible doubt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6540.222" offset="26160797">It isn't necessary and argued but that issue hasn't anything to do with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6545.568" offset="26182217">Now, that's the only thing they argue under this -- about the navigability, the only thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6552.081" offset="26208235">What the Court actually decided was that the Commission's finding was based upon mere speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6559.747" offset="26238955">It ignored positive evidence contrary to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6563.071" offset="26252225">For one thing, it ignored the opinion of the -- from the office of the chief of engineers that this project would not affect a navigability of the Black River and that the plans of the project were satisfactory so far as the interest of navigation were concerned that positive opinion it ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="6587.559" offset="26350132">It indulged in a great -- like the examiner did this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6590.592" offset="26362358">The Commission was not much concerned about this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6593.351" offset="26373329">It was concerned about the other point about statutory interpretation and warded nearly all of its opinions of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6600.760" offset="26403004">But it had adopted the examiner's findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6603.060" offset="26412199">Well, the examiner's findings are wrong in many respects but among others in ignoring that and in ignoring also another fact which was stipulated, the facts about this were stipulated by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="6617.699" offset="26470713">And one of the facts was that the maximum possible effect on what's -- on the stage in flow, stage of course being the level of the water and flow -- the rate at which the water flowed.</text>
