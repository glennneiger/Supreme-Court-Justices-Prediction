            <text syncTime="474.897" offset="1899520">Well Your Honor, if I may advert to those treasury regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.840" offset="1919269">One of the principle and to us as -- in the executive branch most persuasive arguments raised by the taxpayer in Court and out of Court and they've been raised both places, is that the existence of the power that is claimed by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue here to act with respect to the deposits which -- to deposits which are payable at a foreign branch of the U.S. bank will drive away the business of the foreign branches and its in the best interest of the United States to have flourishing prosperous foreign branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.124" offset="2092408">And the hard case, which was put on the basis of the situation as we originally initiated this action was a Swiss or a Romanian will be loathe to put his money in the foreign branch of the U.S. bank in Romania or Switzerland if he realizes that by doing that he is immediately subject to the vicissitudes or the whims of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.189" offset="2216751">This treasury regulation is a self-imposed, but nevertheless effective restraint on the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for bidding him to seek administratively or by judicial process any remedy with respect to a deposit in the foreign branch of a United States bank except where there is personal jurisdiction over the person, whose account is at stake or whether the deposits in that account or where the deposits in that account, the Commissioner satisfied, came to that account or were credited to that account in an effort to hinder or defeat collection of tax on income realized from sources in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.824" offset="2435239">So, the Australian, Egyptian or Romanian who wants to bank with the United States‘ branch has never had any transactions in the United States need to have a little concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.136" offset="2472542">On the other hand, there is still a very important area reserved within which we hope with the decision of this Court will be -- where would be continued -- be allowed to continue and operate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1129.460" offset="4517825">New York Court say that, makes lascivious of the debt Montevideo, not New York, therefore, there's nothing in New York to form the basis for in rem, quasi in rem jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1301.042" offset="5204114">And beyond that Your Honor, there is this McGrath against City Service case, which suggests that if the bank is driven to the wall on this and is ultimately trapped into this double liability, there is a basis for claiming that they have a right for a just compensation for an unlawful taking and can sue in the Court of Claims on account of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.074" offset="6172212">In my judgment, the real and only issue that's presented here is one of fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.585" offset="6198335">This is an appeal from an injunction and the respondent is not and at no time has been appealing on the basis that the Court had no power to issue that injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.498" offset="6245982">We have based our appeal on the ground that it was an abusive discretion, that it was an inequitable thing to do and so far, the Court of Appeals has agreed with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.061" offset="6300212">Now, this is a rather broad statement and I've got to support it by reference to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.112" offset="6324349">Let me point out first of all, that the respondent in this case is not the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.114" offset="6344411">The respondent has been conducting its business and is in no way delinquent in taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.548" offset="6366145">So, we have here a restraint, which is imposed on a third party, not on the ultimate defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.548" offset="6398119">This is in effect, a garnishment proceeding and the respondent bank is in the position entirely of a third party stakeholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.244" offset="6440960">Furthermore, we are talking here about an action, which has as its only purpose the acquisition, the taking of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.170" offset="6480666">This is a physical action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.980" offset="6491847">Mr. Justice Harlan said we're talking in effect about a sequestration of property and the property in question is the property of Omar, not of this respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.826" offset="6535210">Now, the property that we're talking about is not the property in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.248" offset="6556944">This is so, by definition. The Court below did not refer, my learned adversary has repeatedly in the briefs and here again, today did not refer to accounts or property, which is collectible in the first instance abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.082" offset="6624235">It referred to deposits and to property which collectible only abroad, only abroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.022" offset="6652029">So, what we're dealing with here is a situation in which the property that the Government seeks to get and it is property that they want, is property which lies outside the jurisdiction of the United States and this must be so, because there is no issue as to any property in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2374.996" offset="9499899">And my answer to that was that, I would hope that we would be, because the jurisdiction over Omar the in personam jurisdiction would at the most be a rather tenuous one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.922" offset="9547651">Now quite clearly, if Omar were a party to this proceeding and could be effectively hobbled as far as any reprisals against the bank overseas were concerned, the practical risk of multiple liability would to that extent be lessened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.321" offset="9629257">But the difficultly is that as I see it here, if there is to be in personam jurisdiction over Omar, it is purely a conceptual jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.254" offset="9677009">This is a Uruguayan Corporation, which is not doing business in the United States to the extent that there's anything that can bite down on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.803" offset="9723193">And even if our Courts were to assert the right to pronounce a judgment in personam against Omar, I'm far from satisfied that this would effectively prevent him or if from taking reprisals in Courts of other countries, which would not regard the order of this Court as a defense to that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.765" offset="9827056">Consequently, I feel that the absence of Omar as a party to this action, while it aggravates the situation is not the sole determinative factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2655.005" offset="10619925">Now, we have seen very clearly on this argument that the determination as to whether there is a violation of foreign law is something which is not accepted just on the bank's say so.</text>

And subsequently, after the appeal below the attorneys who represented Omar in the Tax Court wrote a letter in which they said that, at the time of service, there was a current account, one current account in Uruguayan Pesos and an amount due in U.S. Dollars, the total aggregating about the equivalent of $2,000 in Uruguay and they said that, that was all that there was, but we don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.582" offset="11646328">The problem that is faced and this comes back to the question of the so-called New York rule, the problem of jurisdiction in rem or quasi in rem is this, that we are dealing here with a practical separation of function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.028" offset="11724069">The bank, although it is a single corporate entity, operates overseas within the context of the laws of the various foreign countries and the consequence is that the foreign branch of the bank as a practical matter is exactly the same and in exactly the same posture as it were a bank, which were organized and existing under the laws of that country, as if it were a foreign bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.897" offset="11835559">When a foreign individual or person or a friendly alien as American in that country, deals with that bank, he deals with it subject to the laws of that country and entirely under the same conditions as if it were a bank in that country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.019" offset="11912046">The result of this is that there is not and never has been any property in any real sense in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.554" offset="11938168">There is no real tangible property here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.935" offset="11951647">The only property that exists is a right on the part of the depositor, a contract right and that right has no existence except at the place where it was made and in accordance with the laws of the country under which it was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.593" offset="12010371">The consequence of that is that, it is not only unreasonable in fact, but unnecessary in law to create the fiction that because the bank is a single corporate entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.851" offset="12063347">It is liable for every deposit at every place where it does business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.168" offset="12088633">The result of that in turn is that the banks contract with its depositor is simply to repay a like kind and amount of the currency it has received at the place it has received it in accordance with the law of that contract, the foreign law of that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.945" offset="12163762">And therefore, neither the depositor nor anyone claiming through him can demand at a different area in a different currency, what the bank has contracted to give it back to him at a particular place and in a particular currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.005" offset="12247980">Referring to our brief, we have pointed out and I think with justice that, just as the bank cannot be expected to respond in London and pay Sterling in respect of an account, which was opened by someone in Rupees in India, neither could the bank having accepted dollars at an account in New York City hope to discharge its liability to its depositor by tendering him Rupees in India or Sterling in London.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.528" offset="12390087">There is a localization, an unnecessary localization of international branch accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.955" offset="12419762">In consequence of this, the New York Courts have recognized consistently that the account in a foreign branch is not property within the jurisdiction, is not to be treated as property and that neither the depositor nor anyone claiming through him is entitled to leap the barrier to anticipate or alter the obligation and make the demand and be paid in New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="3255.258" offset="13020996">In this case, the record indicates that there was here in New York, a combination of securities and accounts payable at Lazard and Lehman Brothers, which were caught.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.194" offset="13256725">I think if I may take that as the basis of summing up on this.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis F. Oberdorfer</label>
            <text syncTime="3545.778" offset="14183027">Mr. Chief Justice, we are of course sensitive to the fact that this is a proceeding in equity and Mr. Harfield framed the question in terms of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.666" offset="14274664">The equities include as Justice Goldberg has pointed out, the fact that the taxpayer here was embarked on a conscious effort in the nature of a transaction in fraud of creditors, the creditor being the United States to get his funds out of the United States before they could be used to apply to a tax liability with the respect to which a taxpayer hadn't filed any returns, much less paid the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.926" offset="14427638">The bank suggests that its foreign branch, although it operates abroad with the protection and the prestige backed by the sovereignty of the United States, should be a kind of privilege sanctuary into which as I understand it, a United States taxpayer can protect his funds from application to satisfy his United States tax liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.839" offset="14599314">Even though he's been served personally and even though as I understand in response to the questions from Justice White, he is the United States Corporation, not just a foreign corporation nor a United States individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.426" offset="14649678">So far as the law is concerned, the question then is whether in those circumstances the bank should be exposed to some imaginary unproved, problematical, doubtful, possibly nonexistent double liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.817" offset="14731180">If in those circumstances, a Court of the United States entered an order against the bank directing it to hold on to funds in Uruguay and after that order it had been entered, this taxpayer who is described in the record and I've described sued in Uruguay, sued the United States bank for some kind of tort or breach of contract, the damages of which can't even be defined and by some quirk of Uruguayan law, the bank in spite of the defense by -- of the solemn judgment of the United States Court, in spite of the equities, the bank were held liable in Uruguay in that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.932" offset="14927726">Now, not only is that we think a far fetched unlikely academic guess, something that this Court should not rely on in making a decision, but the bank attached to its brief in chief and in an appendix on Page 1(a), reports that it asked the Uruguayan Counsel what would happen, if the bank in Uruguay refused to pay under circumstances not as egregious as the equities in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.080" offset="15068264">And on Page 9(a) of the Appendix, there is included a letter from Uruguayan Counsel to whom the bank addressed its inquiry, the letter saying that injunction order issued by U.S. Court is not applicable in Uruguay that means this isn't a defense in Uruguay, unless the injunction is properly submitted and approved by the Supreme Court of Uruguay following the legal requisites required by Uruguayan Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.642" offset="15202534">In other words, the suggestion is that if you come down to the ultimate essence of this double liability issue and the bank vigorously defends itself in Uruguay as it would and can, as its defended itself here, the Uruguayan Court would not hold the bank liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.806" offset="15283200">Thank you.</text>
