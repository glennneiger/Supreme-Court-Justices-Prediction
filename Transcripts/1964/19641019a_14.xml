            <text syncTime="6.975" offset="27899">Mr. Plant, you may proceed with your argument.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Marion B. Plant</label>
            <text syncTime="11.230" offset="44826">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.845" offset="51304">This case is here on certiorari to the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.961" offset="83801">The certiorari was granted on two questions which were set forth in the petition as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="31.285" offset="125074">One, was petitioner required by the National Labor Relations Act to bargain with a union representing some of its employees about whether to let to an independent contractor for legitimate business reasons, the performance of certain operations in which those employees had been engaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.861" offset="243357">Two, was the Board in a case involving only a refusal to bargain empowered to order the resumption of operations which had been discontinued for legitimate business reasons and reinstatement with back pay of the individuals formally employed therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.495" offset="353907">The petitioner is Fibreboard Paper Products Corporation, and to avoid myself getting mixed up between petitioner and respondent, I will, if it please the Court, refer to the petitioner as Fibreboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.866" offset="423393">Fibreboard owns or did own in 1959 a number of manufacturing plants on the Pacific Coast and in some offshore states.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.591" offset="478354">One of those plants was located at Emeryville, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.915" offset="503641">There were 13 unions in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.339" offset="525270">Five of them represented one or another unit of maintenance workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.414" offset="557558">The largest unit of maintenance workers was represented by a local of the steel workers, which is the union involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.572" offset="630282">For some years, Fibreboard had been concerned about the high cost of its maintenance work, the work of maintaining that plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.221" offset="688797">In 1957 and again in 1958, it had sought to persuade the union to modify its wage and other contract demands, so as to permit Fibreboard to operate and carry on these maintenance operations at the cost which would not be too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.453" offset="805721">Those efforts had been unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.639" offset="822544">Thereafter, it commenced a study of the possibility of affecting savings and costs by letting this work to an independent contractor specializing in plant maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.243" offset="904882">The collective bargaining contract which was in effect in 1959 and by the way, Fibreboard had had collective bargaining contractual relationships with its union for 22 years, the current contract was to -- expired or at least the termination date was on July 31st, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.676" offset="1022642">The required 60 days before that date, the union gave notice of desire to modify that contract and shortly thereafter served upon Fibreboard proposals involving changes in every provision of the contract which affected costs, and each of those changes would have increased the costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.746" offset="1150955">Fibreboard thereafter brought its study up to date of the question of letting this work to an independent contractor and decided to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.091" offset="1208320">It reached that decision on July 27th, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.317" offset="1241234">On that date, it had not yet decided who the contractor would be, but it had satisfied itself by getting figures from several and considering the problem with several, that savings and cost could be affected by that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.482" offset="1321900">Immediately and I mean within the hour, after that decision was made, the Fibreboard director of industrial relations called the local and international business agents of the union and arranged a meeting with them or a meeting with them later that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.627" offset="1422420">At that meeting he handed them a letter stating that Fibreboard had reached its decision that in view of the decision which had been reached, Fibreboard considered that negotiation of a renewed contract would be pointless but that nevertheless Fibreboard would be glad to discuss any questions the union might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.170" offset="1552614">During the course of the meeting, the director, Mr. Tuman (ph), told the business agents that he had in mind a plan for severance pay which he outlined, they had no comments upon that or any suggestions to make with respect to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.609" offset="1662433">The conversation on that occasion was pretty much limited to assertions by the business agents that Fibreboard couldn't do it and by Tuman that Fibreboard could.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.672" offset="1722619">The business agents without specifying what provision of the National Labor Relations Act they have referenced too, I guess they didn't know their claim that if Fibreboard did this it would be violating the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.137" offset="1796493">At the conclusion of the meeting, Tuman was asked if he would meet with the union's negotiating committee and he said that he would.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.860" offset="1847380">That meeting was held on July 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.628" offset="1870472">In the meantime on July 29th, the union wrote Fibreboard a letter taking the position that its contract have been automatically renewed subject only to an obligation upon the part of Fibreboard to bargain about all of these contract changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.288" offset="1969110">At the meeting of July 30th with the negotiating committee, Tuman took the position that that wasn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.550" offset="2018116">He of course repeated that Fibreboard had reached this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.033" offset="2052075">He explained the reasons for it, namely, the high cost of the present operation and again repeated that he would be glad to discuss any questions that the union might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.083" offset="2108291">In the course of the conversation, he again outlined the plan for severance pay, no objections were raised to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.574" offset="2154266">Now, he did say that he was not there for the purpose of negotiating a renewed contract but that because he thought that would be pointless.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.588" offset="2202331">He did not, however, cutoff discussion regarding the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.287" offset="2225110">On the contrary, the union certainly didn't understand that.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.231" offset="2248829">It proposed for example that there -- and contained in the renewed contract a provision to the effect that a Fibreboard should contract out work.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.449" offset="2301701">The contractor should be required to employ members of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.887" offset="2323540">Tuman said that that wouldn't be acceptable because he wouldn't want to tie a contractor's hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.927" offset="2351647">If he were a lawyer, he probably would've added that would be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.453" offset="2373799">The union also proposed that the question whether the contract should be let -- be submitted to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.420" offset="2425626">Tuman replied that the company would not want to place a business decision such as that in the hands of an arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.789" offset="2471079">There were some objection -- two occasions by members of the union to the shortness of the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.196" offset="2512771">This contract with the independent contractor was to take effect as of August 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.209" offset="2544744">In reply to that, Tuman said that the -- if the union wished to further time to consider the problem, they would entertain a proposal that the contracting be deferred in order to give the union that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.206" offset="2624784">Advantage was not taken of that suggestion.</text>

            <label>Mr. Marion B. Plant</label>
            <text syncTime="676.246" offset="2704927">Might have been involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.193" offset="2712764">I suppose if the union had come in with a contract proposal which would have involved changes in demanding requirements, lower wage cost, that would have been given very serious consideration, but the union never saw fit to make such a proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.323" offset="2801267">Well, at midnight, July 31st Fibreboard had a picket line and thereafter the union filed the unfair labor practice charges which brought about the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.640" offset="2902518">Fibreboard was charged with a multitude of sins.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.478" offset="2921848">One was discrimination against the union alleged that it was -- purpose was discriminatory, other charges embraced refusal to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.355" offset="2977332">The hearing was had before the Trial Examiner in which attention was focused mostly upon the question whether there had been a discriminatory motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.153" offset="3036578">There was also attention given to the question whether Fibreboard had refused to bargain about severance pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.178" offset="3084643">The Trial Examiner rendered a report in which he found against the union and general counsel on all issues and recommended that the complaint be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.208" offset="3148800">The case then went up in the normal course to the Board itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.430" offset="3181714">The Board adopted the Trial Examiner's findings and dismissed the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.826" offset="3223301">In the course of its opinion however, it noted that general counsel in his exceptions to the Trial Examiners had report had complained that the Trial Examiner did not pass upon an issue claimed to be of primary importance in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.100" offset="3316297">Namely, the question whether Fibreboard was under a duty to bargain about the decision to let the contract, in other words, about whether or not it should let the contract to this independent contracting.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.042" offset="3420160">At that time, there were a long line of Board decisions which had received a congressional approval as I will demonstrate a little bit later.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.030" offset="3484108">And there were a number of court decisions all based upon the hypothesis that there was no duty to bargain about whether you let a contract, whether you discontinue a business, whether you sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.448" offset="3581701">Those cases regarded the act as requiring and not let you bargain about the operations which are going to carry on, but only about the wages, hours and terms and conditions upon which manner to be employed in those operations upon which you decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.781" offset="3695073">And accordingly they had held that there was no duty to bargain over a question such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.412" offset="3729554">However, shortly after that decision was rendered the membership of the Board changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.887" offset="3779500">The union and general counsel both moved for reconsideration and the Board after sitting on those motions for a year and a half vacated its -- no, that's not true -- modified its prior decision to the extent of holding that there was a duty to bargain about whether or not you can let work to an independent contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.745" offset="3938952">Now, there were several peculiarities about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.935" offset="3955670">In its first decision, the Board had said that you were under no such duty and never considered or passed upon the question whether Fibreboard had in fact bargained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.991" offset="4015961">In the second decision, the Board or rather the panel of the Board likely assumed that the Board in its first decision had held that Fibreboard did not in fact bargained and proceeded to decide the case on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.667" offset="4102583">A few months before the second decision, there had come before the Board, the Town &amp; Country Manufacturing Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.166" offset="4156604">That was a case in which the employer had contracted out work for the purpose of frustrating unionization, of avoiding his bargaining obligation and he was guilty of an unfair labor practice for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.030" offset="4232046">The Board went out of its way however to say that even if this had not been true, it considered that there was a duty to bargain that its first Fibreboard decision was wrong, and that that the employer would have been guilty of a refusal to bargain even though there have been no improper motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.679" offset="4346671">It based that decision upon the ground that after all, the decision to contract out work has impact and effect upon the employment in the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.120" offset="4420441">The reason for that long delay of year and a half in deciding Fibreboard number two was that one of the members of the Board had been the regional director who issued the complaint and was therefore disqualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.933" offset="4555651">The Board therefore, those who were qualified to participate were evenly divided, two to two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.550" offset="4594103">Now, as this Court knows from its own practice normally, what has done in that situation is to deny release by an equally divided court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.559" offset="4654184">In that case, it should've been to deny relief by an equally divided Board but the Board didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.777" offset="4695040">The reason is explained by the Solicitor General in his answer to the petition for certiorari as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.373" offset="4733492">Both the general counsel and the union sought reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.683" offset="4754704">Due to changes in the membership of the Board and the disqualification of one member to participate in the case, the agency was equally divided even though a majority of the Board as then constituted was of the view that an employer has an obligation to bargain about a decision to contract out an operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.097" offset="4880300">In these circumstances, the agency did not abuse its discretion in postponing its decision on the motions of reconsideration and until as a result of another decision, the majority view could be applied in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.358" offset="4957414">In other words, until the view of a member who was disqualified could be applied in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1260.657" offset="5042573">Now, and the Board found favorable -- Fibreboard not only guilty of a refusal to bargain but for the first time in the history of the Act in a case involving only a refusal to bargain, it ordered reinstatement with back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.047" offset="5136091">It ordered that Fibreboard resume performance of the maintenance operations which had been discontinued as too costly and that the individuals who had been employed therein be reinstated with back pay to the date of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.778" offset="5223027">It didn't order back pay all the way back because they recognized that after all Fibreboard had received a pretty bad treatment problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.582" offset="5274227">Now, as I have said, there was a long line of Board decisions to the contrary and what the Board did in the Town &amp; Country case and in the present case was simply to change the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.260" offset="5368999">The earliest decision and dealing with this question of contracting was rendered in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.369" offset="5469414">It was the case of Brown McLaren Manufacturing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.041" offset="5500134">In that case, the company had a contract with Sears, Roebuck for the performance of certain manufacturing operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.904" offset="5547572">It was losing money on that contact, it conceived that the reason that it was losing money was that its wage cost were too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.577" offset="5582263">It sought wage relief from the union and manning relief, it was unable to obtain it, and then contracted out to another contractor, the Sears, Roebuck work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.763" offset="5651017">Now, in connection with that aspect of the case, the Board said that if there was any duty to bargain about reduced wages as an alternative to contracting out, that duty had been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.727" offset="5706815">But that wasn't the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.315" offset="5721234">The employer then proceeded to contract out other work in the plant and moved work to another plant which it had ultimate -- which it ultimately acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.985" offset="5783928">The union asked that the employer bargain about this matter of letting work to other contractors or moving it out of the plant, the employer denied doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.870" offset="5851429">Some more time went by, the same request was made, the employer still denied doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.405" offset="5877551">The third time, it still denied doing it but when confronted with some facts by the union, admitted it, and refused to discuss the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.424" offset="5925616">Thereafter on several occasions, the request was made that it bargained about removal of work in the future from the plant, the union offered to talk about a wage decrease, the employer refused to negotiate, refused to discuss the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.647" offset="6022583">The Board held that in these circumstances, the employer was not guilty of a refusal to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.536" offset="6062080">However, the Board do a distinction which is significant in later cases that said that although it was not guilty of a refusal to bargain about letting the contract, it should have bargained with the union upon the union's request that employees be transferred to the new plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.733" offset="6154867">In other words, should have bargained about their tenure of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.687" offset="6178691">Now, counsel say that it is doubtful that that case really held that there was no duty to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.760" offset="6222994">Now, if it was equivocal and that maybe, I don't know, there certainly was nothing equivocal about the decisions which followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.635" offset="6266462">In Mahoning Mining Company decided in 1945, the owner of three mines let the operation of two of them to independent contractors, did not consult the union about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.285" offset="6333127">First, the union knew about it was went to negotiate a renewed contract with the employer and he said that he no longer operated those two mines, they were operated by independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.128" offset="6400418">The Trial Examiner was of the opinion that the employer should have required the contractors to the -- adhere to the terms of the bargaining contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.478" offset="6457887">The Board reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.568" offset="6470217">Now, there is a case squarely presenting the question whether the employer was bargained the -- it was required by law to bargain about letting the contracts and the Board squarely decided that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.282" offset="6549107">It said that the Board has never held that an employer may not in good faith without regard to union organization of employees change his business structure, sell or contract out a portion of his operations or make any like change which might affect the constituency of the appropriate unit without first consulting the bargaining representative of the employees affected by the proposed business change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.840" offset="6707304">The next case was decided in 1949, Walter Holm &amp; Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.479" offset="6753907">There, the employer had leased its truck to its drivers and thereafter entered into an arrangement under which its former employee drivers were to operate its trucks as independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.520" offset="6838021">The Trial Examiner held that the employer have been guilty of a refusal to bargain in failing to consult the union before doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.682" offset="6882638">The Board held that it was not guilty of such a refusal that there was no duty to consult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.560" offset="6910224">It equated the case with the case where a man goes out of business and said, “Section 8 (a) (5) does not require an employer to consult with his employees' representative as a prerequisite of going out of business for nondiscriminatory reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.693" offset="7006772">The next case in 1951, was Celanese Corporation of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.869" offset="7035402">Now, everything I've quoted so far has been the Board's own language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.636" offset="7058495">It's the Board itself talking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.503" offset="7069989">In the Celanese case, the Board adopted a Trial Examiner's report without itself writing any real opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.310" offset="7117218">There, it was a case in which the employer had contracted out maintenance work and the Board adopted the Trial Examiner's opinion in which he said, “The company was not required to consult with the union as the representative of its employees before entering into this contract anymore than if it was going out of business for nondiscriminatory reasons”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.699" offset="7242710">Now, that is enough for the quotations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.379" offset="7253473">There are more cases like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.846" offset="7263295">There was one in 1952, Trans Wire (ph) &amp; Manufacturing Company and there was one in 19 -- another in 1952, the National Gas Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.377" offset="7329437">And finally, there was the original decision in this case in which the Board said that you -- the obligation to bargain is pretty broad but is not so broad as to require that a employer bargain about what operations he's going to engage in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.340" offset="7425358">Now, during this long period, there were court decisions, many of them, bearing upon the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.295" offset="7473110">There was a long line of Board decisions and court decisions which made the questions whether there had been a breach of the duty to bargain, depend entirely upon the employer's motivation that his motive was to frustrate unionization or union organization to avoid his bargaining obligation then he was held guilty of a refusal to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.997" offset="7631935">If his motives were pure, if he was motivated simply by legitimate business considerations, then he was held not guilty of a refusal to bargain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1933.100" offset="7732349">The only question considered in the second case was whether there was a duty to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.708" offset="7770802">The Fibreboard's good faith was not impugned after all, it had been dealing with this union for 22 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.053" offset="7808209">Its motivation was purely good business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.509" offset="7846034">Now, the fact that this matter of motivation is important, is illustrated by the cases that I have just cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.503" offset="7909982">One of which cited in either the Board's or the union's brief, I forget which, it was Brown Duncan Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.063" offset="7960242">There, the Court holding that there was improper mu -- motivation said that the company may not discontinue a part of an integrated operation merely because the employees engaged in the particular work -- in the particular unit, seek union representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.239" offset="8056895">In circumstances like these, (Inaudible) -- motivation becomes important, indeed decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.529" offset="8094093">There was another long line of cases which drew the distinction between bargaining about the decisions to let work to a contractor or sell a business or discontinue a business and bargaining about measures designed to ease the impact of that decision upon employees majors such as severance pay wages or supplying other employment, tenure of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.161" offset="8260545">They held that there was a duty to bargain about those latter questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.751" offset="8290952">But in those cases, again the distinction was clearly drawn, and for example, in the case of Rapid Bindery Inc. likewise cited in either the Board or the union's brief and perhaps both, the -- or after finding the employer guilty of a refusal to bargain about transferring employees went on to say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.726" offset="8454896">And we are also the opinion that in as much as the move, this was the case of moving operations from one plant to another, we're also of the opinion that in as much as the move was made through a legitimate exercise of managerial discretion, the issue of whether it was the -- whether it was to -- whether it was to be made need not have been submitted by respondents for discussion at the bargaining table.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.282" offset="8585091">Now, while all these cases were being decided, the Congress subjected the Act to two general revisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.466" offset="8629812">The first was the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.079" offset="8664294">Up to that time, Section 9 (a) of the Act had contained a provision to the effect the certified union was to be the exclusive representative of employees for the purpose of bargaining about rates of pay, wages, hours of employment or conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.586" offset="8806296">And it was under that provision that the first two of the Board cases that I have referred to were decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.175" offset="8848614">In 1947, Congress subjected the Act to a general revision and in Section 8 (d) the new section defined the duty to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.875" offset="8911412">And in defining the duty to bargain, it used substantially this same language which had been interpreted by the Board in the manner which I have set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.701" offset="8962717">In 1959, the Act again was subjected to a general revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.936" offset="8999706">In that interval there had been four more of these Board decisions to which I have referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.302" offset="9037113">Congress used the same language and apparently adopted and approved the interpretation which had been placed upon that language.</text>

            <text syncTime="2288.417" offset="9153620">The nearest -- the legislative debates or discussions came to the subject matter was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.176" offset="9208686">In 1947, the House Bill contained a provision defining bargaining which was very detailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.582" offset="9250273">It just laid out, you do, one this, two this, three this, four this, and it was very specific and the subjects which it specified as subjects of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.697" offset="9330730">Congressman Kennedy and a few others wrote a minority committee report in which they made a lot of objections to this language, one was that it would eliminate contracting from bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.525" offset="9410038">I questioned the accuracy that it was eliminated, never been there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.968" offset="9427801">And they wrote a minority report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.380" offset="9441489">The Senate Bill which as -- was finally enacted, contained a somewhat broader language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.762" offset="9487047">I don't think it had any bearing upon a particular question for us now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.451" offset="9505750">And that Congressman Kennedy and the others would sign the minority report in the House, voted against that as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.475" offset="9541799">Now, I don't think it proves anything and I have placed no reliance upon legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.642" offset="9586521">Now, since the Board's decision in the Town &amp; Country case and in this case, the second decision, it has is applied this doctrine which to develop in those two cases to employer's decisions to ship by common carrier or contract carrier trucks rather than by his own trucks to a decision to go out of business because he was broke, to a decision to sell three of several stores that he owned, to a decision to purchase a cheese product already packaged rather than packaging it himself, to a decision to move a certain operation from one plant to another, and to -- well, that's enough I guess, there are more but I can't think of them on hand.</text>

            <text syncTime="2598.326" offset="10393287">It did not meant only that if you did any bargaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="3063.374" offset="12253414">I don't think it can be equated with the National Labor Relations Act notwithstanding some similarities in wording.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.177" offset="12288627">Now, this Court has touched upon this question quite recently in Wiley &amp; Brothers versus Livingston -- or Wiley &amp; Sons versus Livingston.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.885" offset="12367517">That was the case in which you will recall there had been a corporate merger and the question was whether the surviving corporation was bound by the provisions in the collective bargaining contract of the corporation which lost its identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.738" offset="12450900">The Court held that it was and in the course of its discussion, it said this, it said that unions ordinarily do not take part in negotiations leading to a change in corporate ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.036" offset="12540134">And it then referred and I quotes, “To the rightful prerogative of owners independently to rearrange their businesses and even eliminate themselves as employers”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.187" offset="12616725">Now, that is the latest expression of the Court bearing upon this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.856" offset="12643370">Now, I've got five minutes to get these employees unreinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.496" offset="12669910">So, with the Court's permission I will proceed to the second question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.952" offset="12703765">As I have stated that -- this is the first case in the history of the Act which in reinstatement has been ordered in the case involving only a refusal to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.515" offset="12754024">Counsel have taken issue with me on that, pointing to the unfair labor practice strike situations in which a strike has been induced by a refusal to bargain and in which employees are ordered reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.486" offset="12829884">Well, the theory of those decisions is that by refusing to take the striking workers back, the employer discriminates against them upon account of their legitimate union activity and violates Section 8 (a) (3) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.552" offset="12922149">And I repeat that this is the first case in the history of the Act which an employer has been ordered to reinstate employees in a case involving only a refusal to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.638" offset="12998531">I suggest to the Court that the order violates Section 10 (c) of the Act which explicitly deprived the Board of power to reinstate an employee terminated or discharged of cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.293" offset="13081078">Now cause doesn't mean just misconduct that is demonstrated by the legislative history in which Senator Taft explained on the floor of the Senate that there were two kinds of discharge, discharges for union activity and discharges for cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.782" offset="13171043">But in the case of a discharge for a union activity, the Board could reinstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.220" offset="13196852">But in the case of a discharge for a cause, it could not, and by cause it was obviously the embraced discharges for all -- any reason other than union activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.140" offset="13248470">And in that connection, he said that his -- no provision was merely setting forth what was the existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.299" offset="13281176">And the existing law had been declared by this Court in at least three cases to be exactly what I have stated that an employer cannot discharge for union activity or for the purpose of coercing union members or people who want to be union members, but it can discharge for any other reason that it wants, good or bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.324" offset="13393293">Now, my time is short, those cases are in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.112" offset="13412415">We also think that the order that we resume operations which have been discontinued because they were too costly, reinstate employees with back pay and then start bargaining about whether we can do the same thing over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.591" offset="13486289">It serves no purpose and disunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.724" offset="13498828">We wouldn't have a chance of getting employees to quit their present jobs, to come back to work for us, at 1959 wage rates with no assurance that three weeks later after appropriate bargaining, we'd contract out the work and they'd be out of the job again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.499" offset="13593913">Obviously, if we have been guilty of a refusal to bargain, the remedy is a simple order that we bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.934" offset="13635709">We have no interest in discriminating against these people that has been found, our interest is in saving money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.065" offset="13672176">And if they can work out a bargain with us that we'll save his money, we'd be delighted that they come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.188" offset="13700702">But the bargain has to be worked out first, both from our stand point and from theirs, no man is going to leave his present job to return to Fibreboard unless he has assurance of a bargain made in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.867" offset="13759425">Now, my time is up and I'm about out of words.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="3575.282" offset="14301100">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.667" offset="14318655">I think it would be well in the beginning to go back for a moment and look at exactly what it is that petitioner decided to do without consulting the union in this case, and exactly what it is that it claims the right to do without bargaining collectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.069" offset="14396186">In practical terms as applied to the employer and to the employees, petitioner's decision to contract out this maintenance work meant four things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.174" offset="14448640">In the first place, Fluor, a labor contractor was tech -- was intruded between petitioner and the men in the plant who would be doing the maintenance work and by that I include the work in the power plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.281" offset="14513110">Now, the minor supervision would be done by Fluor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.012" offset="14527948">Fluor would be technically the person who hired and fired the employees all subject to petitioner's ultimate direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.303" offset="14561176">Second, the same work would continue to be done, the same labor in petitioner's plant, according to petitioner's need, with petitioner's tools, at petitioner's expense that this was a (Inaudible) contract, and subject to petitioner's ultimate direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.870" offset="14643409">The wages, hours, and working conditions under which the work was done would be changed so as to reduce labor cost and out of that reduction of labor cost, petitioner would achieve according to the estimates a very substantial saving.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.020" offset="14712059">But I would estimate and I would emphasize that according to the offer that Fluor made to petitioner, we may judge by that, merely all the savings were anticipated to come out of a reduction in labor standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.885" offset="14775484">They said I'm on -- in the proposal on page 146 of the record, they eliminate most of the fringe benefits such as travel times, subsistence, vacation pay, sick pay, termination pay, paid holidays and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.731" offset="14838909">That they get the right to terminate employees or reduce work forces at any time, that they'd eliminate any work orders or in the working men's language, they had imposed his freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.490" offset="14889900">They get the maxim -- they'd reduced high rate, they (Inaudible) -- get the right to enforce high rates of production from all maintenance employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.824" offset="14923233">Again, a matter of how much work you do for an hour and how much work you do for a buck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.996" offset="14947892">These and other things are the things that they emphasized they would achieve and they were certainly contemplated to be the source most of the savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.928" offset="14987703">Then the fourth thing that happened was that as a result, 70 maintenance employees including all 50 employees in the bargaining unit lost their jobs and new men were brought in to take their places.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.433" offset="15049665">I think its no exaggeration to say that the core of what was done here was the change in the manner of obtaining labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.096" offset="15084356">It substituted one group of workers for another, it changed compensation and then other changed working condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.780" offset="15119047">And that this is what petitioner claims a right to do without consulting the bargaining representative and that it -- still it asserts, it had the right to do without consulting the bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.098" offset="15168366">Whether it had is of course the only legal question presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.513" offset="15193966">I want to say just a word if I may at this point about the scope of the issue presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.835" offset="15227298">It seems to me that it might be defined in anyone of three ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.607" offset="15250390">First, it might be confined to the exact kind of contracting out that I have just described, this would cover almost any case where workers were brought into the same plant to supply labor in that plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.080" offset="15316219">And there, as here I think, it's fair to say that the gist of the change is in the method of obtaining services that that's the practical thrust of it whatever the legal characterizations are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.976" offset="15367837">And that would seem to be all it is necessary to dispose of the present case for the Court to hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.830" offset="15391242">Now, our brief goes one step farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.947" offset="15407752">It argues that what I have called contracting out is a statutory subjection of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.862" offset="15439412">And we used the term contracting out to cover not only bringing the employees of a labor contractor into the plant, to take men's jobs but also shipping work that has normally been done in the bargaining unit out of the plant where it will be done by someone else and his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.547" offset="15522168">I should point out that there is this difference where you're bringing men into the plant, this weight of the whole thing is on labor conditions alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.155" offset="15568562">They're not exclusively but that is certainly the weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.187" offset="15580682">And some of the shipping of work out of the plant may involve in addition to depriving men of the work may involve problems of scheduling, of what tools you have or what tools you have available and what capital you were invested so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.932" offset="15639719">There's a bit more management in it and I think one has to recognize that difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.356" offset="15661349">Now, there's a third way one could define the issue, and that is to say that the phrase, terms and conditions of employment covers anything that has to do with the elimination of jobs, the elimination of work that directly and necessarily affects tenure of employment or as this Court said in the Telegraphers case, permanency of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.456" offset="15761763">And that appears to be what the Board has done in extending the doctrine of the Town &amp; Country case to cover these shutting down of plant or moving a plant to another area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.658" offset="15814531">That type of question it seems to me is a -- not necessarily involved here and we made no argument in this case with respect to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.811" offset="15855177">But I should acknowledge that the Board has carried it that far.</text>

            <text syncTime="3992.034" offset="15968131">But I -- we don't have to go merely that far in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.744" offset="15978893">We don't go merely that far in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.084" offset="15992268">We submit that this change in the manner in which petitioner obtained labor is a mandatory subject of collective bargaining for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.937" offset="16063739">First, we say its well within the plain meaning of the words of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.047" offset="16092160">Section 8 (d) on page 74 of our brief states the duty to bargain collectively is to meet and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.661" offset="16154540">And Section 9 (a) says that the representative chosen by the majority is the representative for the purposes of bargaining with respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment or other conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.279" offset="16221100">Now, it seems to me that there are two ways confining myself now simply to the entomological meaning of the words, the literal meaning of the word, there are two ways in which they might be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.278" offset="16277107">First, if one looks it up in the dictionary, the terms of a contract are simply the provisions of the bargain and the conditions of the contract are simply the stipulations prerequisite to agreement or prerequisite to performance on your side and prerequisite to performance on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.632" offset="16362475">So that literally the terms and conditions of an employment contract are simply the stipulations on which the workers agree to be employed and that the management agrees to appoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.518" offset="16418064">Now, I do not advance here and I do not think it fairly read, we advanced in our brief, the proposition that the duty to bargain extends to anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.153" offset="16480549">I did point out that under this literal meaning of the words, it would extend to anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.502" offset="16509910">But we went on and indicated that the practices of industry and the policies of the Act might produce a limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.777" offset="16547004">We most emphatically pointed out that the Board not only has never adopted that view but in cases cited in our brief has rejected that view and there are number of things which it is held are not mandatory subject of collective bargaining, not only because they maybe contrary to policy of the Act, but also because it thinks they aren't sufficiently related to conditions of employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="4651.233" offset="18604931">If you answer this question no, it's not a term or condition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.611" offset="18622380">There will never be a duty to bargain about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.735" offset="18634919">On the other hand, if you answer it yes, then one has to go on and to inquire on what were the employer's duties under the particular circumstances, and they may vary a good deal as we have sought to explain in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4671.868" offset="18687373">But it seems to be Mr. Justice Stewart, that one can't dispose of those cases simply by saying that they rest under Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4683.629" offset="18734498">The National Labor Relations Act has a definition of labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.307" offset="18757172">It is the identical definition it found in the Norris-LaGuardia Act and it includes the phrase -- in fact it says the controversy about terms and conditions of employment or the association of representation of persons in seeking to arrange terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.789" offset="18827076">And it seems incredible to me to suppose that the definition of labor dispute in the National Labor Relations Act differs from its parent in the Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4718.592" offset="18874305">And even more incredible to suppose that the word “terms or conditions of employment” in one section of the National Labor Relations Act has a different meaning than it had in other sections of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.673" offset="18926655">Now, so much for the words, our second reason and I think this is important as a limiting factor in some cases as well as an affirmative factor helping us with this case and this is why I say I don't rely on the words alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.195" offset="19000738">Second, we think that the established practices in collective bargaining show that contracting out as here involved -- is regarded as involving terms and conditions of employment, or the business practices the industrial practices I should say, the practice in collective bargaining, are certainly relevant under this Court's repeated holding that the term collective bargaining as used in the Labor Act, is considered to absorb and give effect to the philosophy of collective bargaining as worked out in the labor movement in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.284" offset="19157055">Or in the phrase that is always seemed to me a very happy one also take it for the tax case, we think that what is involved here as Justice Cardozo said of the phrase ordinary and necessary expenses of a business in a tax case is not a role of our law, not words of art, but a reference to a way of life and that it's proper to look at that way of life, not to find, as he put it, the answer to the riddle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.090" offset="19268336">Now here, experience shows that contracting out or subcontracting has been widely and effectively brought within the framework of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.652" offset="19326537">Now, the evidence is all in our brief and I referred to it very briefly, a study of 1700 major contract showed that almost repeatedly, 18% I think, contain some kind of restriction on the employer's freedom to contract out or subcontract work and those contract cover around three quarters of a million employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.786" offset="19427056">And this of course does not include any of the instances in which there was bargaining and the union was unable to get a term put in the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="5290.103" offset="21160333">And one of the things that perhaps will have to be argued here someday is whether these cases that Mr. Plant cites having to do with closing a factory and such are different because there you can't show that there has been this widespread and successful practice of bargaining about the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.818" offset="21239223">And to that extent, it differs and makes a somewhat different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.280" offset="21261061">Now, our third reason is that the policy of the Act is very clearly advanced by the decision of the Board and the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="5327.471" offset="21309858">I hardly need to argue in this Court that where there is an ambiguity in the statute, if there is one that the ambiguity should be resolved in the way that effectuates the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.778" offset="21359073">Nor do I need to argue that the prime purpose of this Act is to promote the resolution of conflicts of interest between employers and employees by the process of collective negotiation between the employers and the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.610" offset="21442351">It is a fact and there's no magic wand that will wave it away.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.232" offset="21464921">It is a fact that this subject today is a manner of the most intense concern to employees and it is a fact whatever the decision to this case it will remain a matter of most intense concern and they will of course be free to strike about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5385.789" offset="21543079">Now, the real question here is whether that conflict of interest is to be resolved within the framework that Congress has been -- has provided or whether it is to be pushed outside into the same condition that other sharp issues between management and labor wherein before the National Labor Relations Act was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5408.077" offset="21632209">And I suppose that one of the most worries of things about Mr. Plant's contention, is that in a period where employees' attention, not employers as my brief unfortunately says, employees' attention is riveted on changes that affect their tenure on their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5431.947" offset="21727713">The argument is made that all those changes are to be put outside the processes that have been tested and provided by Congress over a good many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5446.271" offset="21785078">I want to say just a word with respect to the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5452.493" offset="21809946">Mr. Plant attempted to portray and he did portray a fixed course of administrative interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5461.346" offset="21845368">We disagree with his reading of most of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5465.335" offset="21861251">That's all in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.369" offset="21869401">With three parties arguing here, we all see them a little differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="5471.171" offset="21884656">I see them as charting a rather uncertain course with a good deal of variation in the direction of the Board was looking on a given occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.327" offset="21933244">And I think that's quite natural because that was a period when the practices in industry were developing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.443" offset="21965740">Now, as we think the evidence shows very clearly bargaining about subcontracting has become an established -- a common way of doing things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5503.610" offset="22014433">It is widely and successfully treated as a condition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5508.308" offset="22033136">So the Board then adopted a role, not breaking new ground, as it said in one of these cases but recognizing a condition that existed in the industrial world.</text>
            <text syncTime="5521.834" offset="22087262">Whether I'm right or not in that, certainly Mr. Plant is wrong in saying that there was a consistent course of interpretation contrary to this decision because the Timken Roller Bearing case which was -- as I said before cited by this Court in Teamsters against Oliver squarely held against it in 1945 or 1946, just prior to the Taft-Hartley amendments which made no change in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5553.449" offset="22213695">I indicated that there were two other issues in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5561.349" offset="22245355">The question whether the employer violated Section 8 (a) (5) here turns first on whether this contracting out involved terms or conditions of employment and second, on whether he had a duty to consult with the union before making unilateral change.</text>
            <text syncTime="5586.844" offset="22347337">We think that in this case as we argue in the brief they were done of the conditions that by excuse prior consultation with the union, and since the finding below and the limited grant of certiorari which makes irrelevant to great many things that Mr. Plant argued is, established that he didn't bargained before he determined to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5609.522" offset="22438034">And as I understand him, he doesn't make any argument that he had no duty if this is a term or condition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5617.263" offset="22468963">The second issue -- second additional issue is whether the order of reinstatement and to bargain was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.248" offset="22520895">On that, I stand on my brief except only for one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5635.128" offset="22540434">What Mr. Plant says in his reply brief on page 25, there will be found no case, order or agree in the statement in which the order was not supported by a finding of a Section 8 (a) (3) violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5650.583" offset="22602292">I think the young man in his office rather let it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.062" offset="22616189">I have here a list of 10 such cases, the principle one being NLRB against Washington Aluminum Company decided by this Court one or two terms ago in 370 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="5669.345" offset="22677316">Those 10 are all cases in which there was only an 8 (a) (1) violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.521" offset="22702080">There was no 8 (a) (3) violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5678.354" offset="22713365">Then in the argument here he said, “Well, it'd be found no case prior to this one in which there was an order or reinstatement made where there was only a Section 8 (a) (5) violation”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5689.753" offset="22758922">I have three of those, all Board decisions, all before this case, the earliest going back to 87 NLRB.</text>

            <text syncTime="5719.508" offset="22877936">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.581" offset="22890266">I think what the Solicitor General has told the Court places this case in the proper focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="5730.288" offset="22921091">I don't certainly want to repeat what he said but I do want to emphasize what happened in this case because Mr. Plant took so long to describe the exact sequence of events.</text>
            <text syncTime="5745.155" offset="22980545">He did describe the fact that the employer was concerned about his maintenance cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="5752.899" offset="23011579">What happened -- he had raised the question in collective bargaining and he was unable to make a dent in the collective bargaining with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5761.216" offset="23044807">When the union then reopened the contract in May of 1959, the following in suit the union, one, two, three, four times tried to arrange for a collective bargaining conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5779.689" offset="23118681">I think the exact sequence is set out in the Trial Examiners intermediate report and nothing happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="5787.878" offset="23151491">The company refused to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="5790.198" offset="23160790">Meanwhile, they were busily scurrying around to determine whether they could save money on labor cost through the device of letting this to a subcontractor whose people would come in and perform the same work under less onerous labor conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5811.676" offset="23246681">After they had determined that they could do this, on July 27, four days before the 60-day negotiating period provided under the statute had expired, they called the union in and said, “This will come as a shock to you, but there's no point in bargaining contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5830.782" offset="23323063">We'd contracted out all the work”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5834.069" offset="23336229">Now, Mr. Plant did not bring before this Court the question of whether in fact he had bargained with the union about contracting out the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="5843.904" offset="23375517">He sought to bring the finding of the Court of Appeals that he had not before the Court in his second question in his petition for certiorari and the Court limited the grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5855.659" offset="23422537">So that question was not really briefed by us and is not merely here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5860.496" offset="23441972">We operate on the assumption here that the only questions are the two questions which are before the Court is once he under a duty to bargain, and second of all was the remedy by the Board appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5872.726" offset="23490873">And I think you have to get the flavor of what happened here to understand what we mean by the duty to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="5879.874" offset="23519399">Now, this case has been argued so far on kind of mixing up, I think Mr. Plant has taken two questions or maybe there are three and put them into one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5890.612" offset="23562344">One is the duty to bargain simpliciter, that is if a union comes to an employer at the bargaining table and says, “We want to negotiate the provision about contracting out”, or the employer wants to come and said, “We would like a provision and agreement saying we have the right to contract out work at all times”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5910.422" offset="23641652">Is this a subject which the Act requires the parties to meet and confer about in an attempt to reach agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5917.285" offset="23669133">That's the simple meaning of the duty to bargain in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="5922.016" offset="23688046">Mr. Plant says, “No”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5925.490" offset="23701943">That when the union says -- comes to the employer and says, “We think our people are losing jobs because you're sending work out of the plant or you're bringing people in the plant to take our people's jobs, and we want to bargain about that”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5939.435" offset="23757740">Mr. Plant says, the employer can say, “Under the Act, I don't have to talk to you about that subject and I won't”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5948.679" offset="23794625">On the brief, we say that the result of that holding would be that the union couldn't even strike on that subject and I confess here that was a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="5956.611" offset="23826390">Under the law, if Mr. Plant were correct, the union could not refuse to sign a contract on the ground that it didn't contain a provision about contracting out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5967.620" offset="23870380">And couldn't go on strike under those circumstances because that would be a violation of the union's duty to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="5974.259" offset="23897025">Having reached agreement on everything else, the union could not insist on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.281" offset="23917087">He would take this out of that area and certainly the cases seem to indicate that the unions strike in support of a demand for some restriction on the company's right to contract out would be an unprotected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5994.000" offset="23975915">And the employer could discharge people for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5996.921" offset="23987618">Now, that's the simple question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5998.152" offset="23992529">Now, there are only two cases of the Board, this long recitation of cases that deal with that kind of case.</text>

            <text syncTime="6007.585" offset="24030250">No, but the first question -- the question which Mr. Plant argues is that that there is no duty to bargain about contracting out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6016.107" offset="24064418">The second question is assuming there is a duty as there their duty to bargain about wages, once we put the subject within the area, then under what circumstances does unilateral action by the employer without bargaining constitute a violation of 8 (a) (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="6033.406" offset="24133590">That's the second question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6035.061" offset="24140173">He does not argue that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.105" offset="24152398">He argue -- puts his whole question although this is a unilateral action case on the assumption that it is not within the duty in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.100" offset="24188343">But I think this Court has got to separate out those questions because they are different questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.524" offset="24210077">But the first question is, is it within the duty to bargain in the Timken case which the Solicitor General cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="6057.322" offset="24229198">It was the only case and I think one, Hughes Tool case which arose during the term of the contract and the Board said that the union had waived the obligation to bargain because the union want -- were the only two cases on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6069.945" offset="24279771">And it was perfectly clear in 1947 that there was a duty to bargain about contracting out.</text>

            <label>Mr. David E. Feller</label>
            <text syncTime="6078.596" offset="24314358">And indeed even in the unilateral action cases, of the three cases that have been talked about, this case, Town &amp; Country and Adams Dairy which is pending for cert, two of those cases Adams Dairy and Town &amp; Country, the trial examiners who were bound by Board decision had decided and said explicitly it's well established that there is a duty to bargain about contracting out and found employer violations by unilateral action in 1960 before the Board announced the supposedly new change in doctrine and before there was the change in the membership of the Board that's been talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="6116.587" offset="24466286">So, but that's -- that again gets into the unilateral action case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6121.232" offset="24484885">Now, once we established that there is a duty to bargain, then this is just like wages or any other subject within the scope of 8 (a) (5) duty to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="6133.543" offset="24534100">And the question is under what circumstances does employer's action without prior consultation with the union can be said to be a refusal to meet and confer with the union and then violates 8 (a) (5) not because of the subject matter but because of the nature of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="6150.806" offset="24603167">I put aside immediately any case in which there's a contract on the subject, as in the steel industry, we now have what we call an experimental agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6161.881" offset="24647471">But sadly, the Solicitor General's figures about the employees covered omitted 350,000 people who were not covered at the time of that study in the basic steel agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6171.051" offset="24684147">Basic steel industry in which we have agreements concerning contracting out just like an agreement concerning wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="6178.570" offset="24714240">If you have an agreement concerning wages and the employer changes the wage or doesn't pay the wage, you file a grievance, then you violated the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6186.713" offset="24746841">You don't file a refusal to bargain charge because he's not suppose to bargain about wages, he suppose to comply with the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6192.787" offset="24771082">Similarly, if you have a provision in an agreement about contracting out, there is no unilateral action question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6200.235" offset="24800862">There's a question of violation to the agreement and that maybe true even if there is an implied provision in the agreement not only in expressed provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6209.362" offset="24837433">And the cases -- the arbitration cases are interesting because many arbitrators have found that there are implied provisions about contracting out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6218.641" offset="24874527">But at least the unilateral action case is only two.</text>
            <text syncTime="6222.665" offset="24890619">One, and a very difficult one as I really would like to put it aside in view of the limitation of time, the case where there is an agreement and there is nothing in the agreement about contracting out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6235.203" offset="24940774">And then you get the whole argument as to whether is a continuing duty to bargain about matters not covered by an agreement during the term of that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6243.922" offset="24975673">But the easiest case is this case in which the employer at least he had the view that the contract had expired seizes that moment and very carefully, this wasn't done during the term of those agreement, seizes that moment to get rid of all of his employees and saying other people are coming in to do your job and we've hired an independent contractor to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6266.684" offset="25066684">Now, it seems to me perfectly clear that in that case, if there is a duty to bargain about contracting out in the simple sense which I first said, equally, the employer's action in simply doing it and then telling the union about it later and telling the people they have no jobs, and therefore as they said in writing, there is pointless to bargain about a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6291.898" offset="25167517">That kind of an action is the refusal to meet and confer which the Act required.</text>
            <text syncTime="6299.277" offset="25197087">Now, it is particularly clear since Mr. Tuman, their labor relations man said, “I didn't want to meet with the union all this time because we have to decide first whether we're going to contract it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6309.413" offset="25237629">And I didn't want to go through the useless business of negotiating with them until we've made a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6314.685" offset="25258736">And then the minute we made the decision, it was done, then I met to tell them that there was no point in talking about their wages and working conditions because we had somebody coming in here whose wages and working conditions were cheaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="6327.472" offset="25309832">And he would talk then about severance pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="6345.819" offset="25383184">I think it's interesting that the record shows not only the nature of the savings, but that part of the contract that this company made with Fluor was the wage scales which Fluor would pay to its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="6361.937" offset="25447654">It's annexed as an Appendix to the contract with Fibreboard because it was a straight cost-plus deal.</text>

            <text syncTime="6433.790" offset="25735105">They've -- a little one -- a little further.</text>

            <text syncTime="6455.333" offset="25821309">They do this on a such a course of action that what it really amounts to is having the work done in little shop around the corner where there's a nonunion shop that does the work cheap.</text>

            <text syncTime="6467.808" offset="25871151">That kind of thing is clearly within the duty to bargain if the bargaining that takes place in the United States has anything to do with collective bargaining because that's what people are bargaining about.</text>

            <text syncTime="6504.361" offset="26017437">In every industry that I know, unions are interested in and bargain about to the best of their ability the question of what work the employer will provide and that is one of the terms and conditions of employment about which they bargain.</text>

            <text syncTime="6559.032" offset="26236029">And what we say is the job is in the essence of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="6564.093" offset="26256300">And once we say that it comes within the scope of bargaining, then we think clearly the unilateral action which they took in this case, in this case constitute the violation of 8 (a) (5), not necessarily in the other cases which are imagined in the amicus briefs because most of those are taken care of.</text>
            <text syncTime="6582.031" offset="26328085">In the situation there is a contract dealing with the subject expressly or impliedly, or and I think here is an important question.</text>

            <text syncTime="6613.910" offset="26455562">And the claim was that this was a merit increase in accordance with the employer's usual practice and the Court's opinion said, “Well, the question is, was that really the status quo, not necessary the same wage rate at each minute, but that things were done in the same way that they had been done before.</text>
            <text syncTime="6632.536" offset="26530064">Because if that were so then there is no change in conditions, there being no changing conditions, there is no refusal to bargain them, in making the change without bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="6643.295" offset="26573113">In the case in which contracting out is a matter of routine, then even in the absence of a contract pursuing that routine is not a refusal to bargain anymore than a merit increase is a refusal to bargain by make -- changing in wages because both are part of the usual way of doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6663.927" offset="26655660">They are part of status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="6666.393" offset="26665482">The only thing that is a refusal to bargain, because they do so, a violation of 8 (a) (5), in any subject coming within 8 (a) (5) is a change in the terms and conditions without first bargaining with the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="6741.990" offset="26967876">I would say the amount of time he has to talk to them and the amount depends upon the facts and circumstances of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="6859.190" offset="27436722">It maybe very nice for Mr. Plant to say he will talk to us but we're going to be talking in a very peculiar position.</text>

            <text syncTime="6881.330" offset="27525224">The Board only ordered back pay to run from the date of its supplemental decision in this case not from the time back in 1959 when they're thrown out on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="6893.821" offset="27575275">And so there is no horrendous imposition or punitive imposition on Fibreboard to the contrary under the Board's decision as it stands.</text>
