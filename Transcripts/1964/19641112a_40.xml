          <heading>Argument of Maury Maverick, Jr.</heading>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="14.851">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Number 40, John W. Stanford Jr., Petitioner versus State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.176" offset="48692">Mr. Maverick.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="maury_maverick_jr" startTime="14.851" stopTime="514.126">
            <label>Mr. Maury Maverick, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="14.851" offset="59350">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.711" offset="74815">This case pertains to the application -- issuance and execution of a search warrant on the two Texas anti-Communist laws and at a time subsequent, subsequent to the time when the Federal Government had first entered the field of prohibited activities and had ordered the petitioner in this case John Stanford to register under the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.110" offset="188395">The search took place in his home private residence where he conducted a mail order bookstore called All Points of View, over 2000 books, pamphlets, lists, and letters were taken from the petitioner's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.155" offset="252552">Now the two Texas sedition laws at question is first the Texas Communist Control Law that says in its preamble that Texas is a place where there are many vital military installations and Texas is a place where there are many products for national defense and it sets out -- then it sets out the criminal acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.439" offset="341682">If you remain in Texas five days, you must be -- if you're a Communist you must register.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.762" offset="362998">If you're engage in sabotage against the United States or the -- or of Texas you're then subject to criminal punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.659" offset="398629">The next Texas law involved is the Texas Suppression Act of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.149" offset="428513">Section 1 in the form of the preamble describes the international conspiracy of Communism as directed against the United States and the “several states” and then finally against the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.940" offset="491729">And this makes it prime to attempt to overthrow the United States or Texas, to advocate such doctrine, to conspire, to commit such acts, to support or be a member of an organization which engages in such act.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.672" offset="554632">The law so states that the Communist Party cannot be on the ballot in the Communist Party is outlawed in the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.467" offset="581799">Now, then we get to Section 9 of the Texas Suppression Act and this in -- the most vital part of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.157" offset="612624">It says Section 9 that a search warrant maybe issued showing to describe premises as they please where some specified -- some specified phase or phases are being violated or are violated in showing -- in repeating this phase, were showing a violation of some phase or phases of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.410" offset="705620">The affidavit who is supporting the search warrant were signed by Mr. V. Murray Jordan and Lonny F. Zwiener both of whom are Assistant Attorney Generals of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.998" offset="755984">After naming Stanford in their affidavit, they stated that his home poses a place where books etcetera concerning the Communist Party, books concerning the Communist Party of Texas and the operation in the Communist Party of Texas are unlawfully possessed in the violation of these two Texas statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.696" offset="838740">Now here it should be noted that not one phase of either of these two Texas laws was mentioned that this man allegedly was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.721" offset="878864">They based their beliefs they said on this case, “Recent mailings by Stanford on 12, December 1963 a material from his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.536" offset="918047">Such material being identified as pro-Communist and they did not define what this norm -- they did not provide a norm or standards on what is pro-Communist."</text>
            <text syncTime="240.958" offset="963814">They said what he was mailing out of his home was pro-Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.997" offset="979905">Then they had the application for the search warrant signed by Mr. Barlow who carried along the language of the affidavit and then he stated to Mr. Barlow the District Attorney who will speak to you shortly, stated that his belief was founded on the following information, “That this officer had received information from two credible persons that the party named above has such books and records in his possession which are books and records of the Communist Party that such information as recent or again has been confirmed by recent mailings by Stanford on December the 12, 1963, a pro-Communist material."</text>
            <text syncTime="288.702" offset="1154717">Again they do not describe or set out any norm or standard as to what they mean by the term pro-Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.473" offset="1185855">Then District Judge Solomon Casseb Jr. issued his order whom in -- to pick up the books, records, pamphlets "concerning the Communist Party of Texas and the operations of the Communist Party of Texas."</text>
            <text syncTime="311.404" offset="1245518">Now on December 26th, Your Honors, 1963 which is a day before this Texas warrant was issued and acted upon a U.S. Marshall Jessie Dobb served an order on Mr. Stanford to register under the U.S. Subversive Activities Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.681" offset="1330678">By this time -- by the time Stanford had been served with this Texas warrant he had already had a hearing before the federal authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.962" offset="1363801">The next day and this is in the record because we moved it in the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.670" offset="1378638">It had been the headlines in the San Antonio paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.240" offset="1392953">The screaming headline in the San Antonio News, Admit Red Ties, San Antonio Man Ordered, and so there wasn't many secret about the fact that the Federal Government had first entered the field of prohibited activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.048" offset="1448124">Now Your Honors if I may I would like to refer some of the testimony that took place at the hearings to determine to the validity of this search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.357" offset="1485427">First of all, I would bring your attention the testimony of John Good Jr. -- Mr. John Good Jr., he was first Assistant District Attorney in 1949 and 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.051" offset="1544150">He said that either in 1949 or 1950, at the request of then Governor Allan Shivers of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.738" offset="1578945">They called Stanford into the Office of District -- to the Office of District Attorney and they asked him about his activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.940" offset="1607680">They didn't do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.421" offset="1613636">Mr. Good in his testimony said to Mr. Barlow, “You have a file on him Mr. Barlow”.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.063" offset="1636206">But 13 years later and several weeks after the Federal Government enacted and one day after the U.S. Marshal had served this man a process then and only then that the State of Texas moved against this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.582" offset="1706318">Now we get to the witness E.L. Ritchie, the Assistant County Clerk in charge of “Assumed Name” section.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.314" offset="1737247">He got on and testified that Mr. Stanford operated the business in his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.722" offset="1754802">It qualified with all the local laws within his All Points Of View and then at that particular time, in time of the hearing time -- the time of the search warrant, he was acting in accordance with “Assumed Name” statute of Barrett County.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.412" offset="1809554">Now as to the search itself I would like to quote something from the witness Charles Neil.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.279" offset="1845081">Mr. Neil is a retired FBI agent and he states that on December the 27th about 3 PM they went into Mr. Stanford's home and stayed about five hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.846" offset="1895340">He testified that the Office of Attorney General of Texas alone not the District Attorney but the Attorney General alone decided what books would be taken out, his office, his representatives that a number of items were taken from Stanford's home which was not listed on the -- under the inventory, but under the Texas Code of Criminal Procedures they must be listed under the inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.709" offset="1994815">That nothing was found in Stanford's home that was capable of committing any act of physical violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.172" offset="2020624">That private correspondence between Stanford and his American Civil Liberties Union Attorney in Houston Texas was seized and taken away by the police.</text>

            <text syncTime="518.400" offset="2073600">She called her husband and then he came out.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.275" offset="2085094">He was there, the press was there, the T.V. was there -- well -- it's well represented Your Honor, the -- many people are in the house.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="531.502" offset="2125949">And this lasted for five hours?</text>

            <text syncTime="538.152" offset="2152594">No sir, I will get on to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.327" offset="2161267">The -- I will -- I'm going to quote to you later on if I may the statement of the District Attorney that they're waiting to see what this Court does, they want to take him back and get him indicted and put him in the Texas penitentiary if they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.825" offset="2207242">This is what -- this one of the things that's being held in advance at the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.712" offset="2222811">They then picked up the private correspondents between Stanford and his defense committee in New York City, which is representing him on the Subversive Activities Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.856" offset="2263353">They took his correspondents the way that he -- with his committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.727" offset="2278818">They took away Stanford's marriage license.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.885" offset="2287491">They took away his Blue Shield policy, they took away his automobile license, they took away his honorable discharge from the navy and the titled papers to his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.027" offset="2328033">Alright, now the inventory that was going on to this inventory reflected that hundreds of allegedly seditious books and pamphlets were taken out and let us see the spread of books that were taken out, there's a few examples, “Soviet Power” by Hewlett Johnson, “What is to be Done?”</text>
            <text syncTime="599.872" offset="2399399">by V.I. Lenin, “Letters from Prison” by Eugene Dennis, this was supposed to show that he was a man committing a law against -- a violation of the Texas Sedition Laws, “Cuba and the ‘Kennedy Plan'” Che Guevara, “A Visit To Cuba” by I.F. Stone, “Let Man Prevail” by Eric Fromm, “A Faithful Moment in our History” a dissenting opinion by Justice Hugo Black, 19 copies of “Pacem in Terris” by Pope John with editorial comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.311" offset="2521234">He used the word of a good Texan who passed away a few days ago, a few weeks ago, Professor J. Frank Dobie.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.048" offset="2552163">When you read his astounding and astonishing inventory that they -- of things that they took away, when you read that, you can see the elephant and you can hear, do you know that -- you can hear the owl hoot because there just isn't any questions at all if they have taken away things like letters, marriage license, judicial opinions, all as an example of fact that this man is disloyal to the State of Texas.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="663.168" stopTime="666.022">

            <text syncTime="666.022" offset="2664072">Well, Mr. Dobie says -- when he sees something like this, this is bad as this, you can see the elephant and hear the owl hoot.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.811" offset="2695210">That's a colloquial --</text>

            <text syncTime="674.626" offset="2698449">-- expression in my part of the country that when something's really bad, you can see the elephant and hear the owl hoot, maybe I'm being a little to provincial but Mr. Dobie is an old hero of mine and I wanted to quote him before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.995" offset="2759889">Now from the witness Lonny Zwiener, Assistant Attorney General, he was on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.862" offset="2787370">He said that Mr. V. Murray Jordan, Assistant Attorney General made the choice of books to be took -- taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.269" offset="2817045">And then this exchange took place, question, “Alright Mr. Zwiener, do you recall any single object taken from the Stanford home under search warrant issued by Judge Casseb which could be used as a physical object of violence to overthrow the United States of America?”</text>
            <text syncTime="721.542" offset="2886113">Answer, “Not Mr. Maverick, unless you can consider throwing hard backs books -- hardback books to the people -- at people like a weapon”.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.970" offset="2923833">Now then came on the young Assistant Attorney General of Texas, V. Murray Jordan in 1959, graduate of the University of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.580" offset="2962286">He stated that he saw books and publications hostile to Communism in the Stanford home but refused to take them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.556" offset="2994155">Now this exchange took place, question, “Did you see any books unsympathetic to the Communist?”</text>
            <text syncTime="753.813" offset="3015158">Answer, “Yes, sir”.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.087" offset="3020278">“Why didn't you take those out?”</text>
            <text syncTime="756.913" offset="3027592">Answer, “I felt my position there wasn't making selection as to what comes under the affidavit”.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.566" offset="3050162">Question, “The affidavit said you were to pick up books concerning Communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.087" offset="3068343">That's all it said pick up books concerning Communism”.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.049" offset="3080150">Answer, “Well, used by the Communist”.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.721" offset="3090808">Question, “It says concerning the Communist Party, why wasn't the speech by the late John F. Kennedy denouncing the Communist Party taken?”</text>
            <text syncTime="780.995" offset="3123931">Answer, “Denouncing the Communist Party doesn't file -- fall into mind the idea the definition as in the affidavit”.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.718" offset="3150785">Question, “What does the title of the bookstore, All Points of View mean to you Mr. Jordan?”</text>
            <text syncTime="794.904" offset="3179520">Then Mr. Jordan was questioned as to his expertise on the question of Communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.345" offset="3205329">“Did you have any studied -- any experience in the University of Texas on Communism?”</text>
            <text syncTime="816.785" offset="3267082">“No”.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.566" offset="3266978">“Did you have any experience in law school on the study of Communism?”</text>
            <text syncTime="812.153" offset="3266873">“Did you have any extensive formal training in the Navy on the study of Communism?”</text>
            <text syncTime="817.585" offset="3270322">“Have you ever had any training extensively in the field of Communism?”</text>

            <text syncTime="1340.054" offset="5360118">They didn't say it was preempted, so that's a signal to get this man indicted”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.517" offset="5377985">Now if this man, if this law is unconstitutional and if he is indicted, we'll be back in two or three years and so, the status, the State of Texas has joined in with me on asking for a ruling on constitutionality or preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.012" offset="5444023">Now we say that there is a preemption because of the Smith Act, Internal Security Act, the Communist Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.459" offset="5469832">And in the Nelson versus Pennsylvania case this Court found preempion by the mere availability of these federal statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3988.214" offset="15952771">This would depend and it would certainly depend on the evidence produced on the trial as whether or not these books were actually used as an instrumentality of crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="4005.732" offset="16022883">Something that might be read, something of interest something to be studied as a document in history would be one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.178" offset="16052663">But the Communist manifesto being taught as a document or as a theory to influence those who were hearing the teaching to adopt that is a theory with the idea of subsequently at perpetuous time overthrowing the government of the city or the state, or the United States, would cause these documents to be instruments of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.039" offset="16164153">The same with the books themselves, books advocating particular lines of Communist spirit, it would be necessary to prove that in evidence on the trial, the other portions, the other testimony would have to do that, testimony of people who were present -- possibly at meetings where these books were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.625" offset="16266449">Now, that goes of course to the burden of proof that would be on the state before there could be a conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="5556.558" offset="22226129">That certainly in that connection, in the field again of preemption, we might state that the government of a state or a city of the United States isn't overthrown by a single act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5575.367" offset="22301466">It would have to be a series of acts and I believe this Court has recognized that doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5584.476" offset="22337829">The one they stated in the Dennis case that -- but to have a clear and present danger it was not necessary that there actually be a push but that certainly an attempt to overthrow the government by force even though doomed from the outset because inadequate numbers or powers of the revolutionist is a sufficient evil for Congress to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5610.683" offset="22442632">The damage with such attempt creates both physically and politically into a nation makes it impossible to measure the validity in terms of probable success.</text>
            <text syncTime="5623.895" offset="22495504">Now, certainly the Acts that I'll state -- might go into, might consider to be seditious, could be a situation I think -- I can think of a number of inciting a riot possibly as part of a design or scheme to eventually probably overthrow the national government but immediately to create a condition of chaos on a local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="5662.006" offset="22647954">Certainly if you have a riot and the breaking down of law order as a part of a scheme to overthrow the government of the state or to go away with the government of the city and that riot does for a time being cause a breakdown in law enforcement, you have had a temporary breakdown or an overthrow of the government of that particular city.</text>

            <text syncTime="5796.477" offset="23185868">Although they might be some burden on interstate commerce indirectly, the state still has that right to conduct that regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5807.253" offset="23228918">Now in the field of sedition we do have damage to the individuals in a local area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5818.123" offset="23272490">In the case of riot or the other disorders, we have said -- just take for example in the City of Austin, probably 150 policemen and 15 or 20 deputy sheriffs, while there are only three FBI agents.</text>

            <text syncTime="5963.555" offset="23854184">There's a story told about Lincoln that after he had been subjected to an over long argument by opposing counsel that he was reminded and told the court that he was reminded of the lazy preacher who used to get up and give sermon -- very long sermons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5982.608" offset="23930358">And he just got started talking and was too lazy to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="5986.803" offset="23947180">I'm not going to do that I hope.</text>
            <text syncTime="5993.130" offset="23972467">There are some errors that were stated along the way that are purely factual, but I think it would be well to straighten them out now.</text>
            <text syncTime="6002.873" offset="24011442">A reply as was mentioned was filed this morning which deals with the First Amendment questions of vagueness and that question was raised in the trial court and specifically mentioned in paragraphs which are in both the motion and the application for rehearing on pages 5 and 14 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6028.621" offset="24114469">So the issue of vagueness is not being presented to this Court for the first -- as an issue which has never been before -- judicially considered before.</text>
            <text syncTime="6043.465" offset="24173819">The court has shown a certain interest in the knowledge of the Attorney General and that is the affiance about information they had about the books and their content, about the position of Mr. -- of the petitioner Mr. Stanford and this suggests that in some way, a hearing upon return of the warrant can cure the warrant in some nunc pro tunc fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6081.287" offset="24325120">Now I think this Court has in -- complete agreement that that isn't really possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6088.139" offset="24352496">The warrant will have to -- and its issuance will have to be judged in the light of the evidence, the facts and circumstances before the magistrate and in this case it was hearsay evidence only.</text>
            <text syncTime="6102.669" offset="24410593">The sources of that hearsay evidence are still not known to anyone but the affiance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6110.921" offset="24443611">The magistrate as far as we know does not know who provided the information, nor their reliability.</text>

            <text syncTime="6144.481" offset="24577881">One thing which it seems to have been I think distorted or misstated in discussing preempts -- in discussing preemption is a characterization of the Texas statutes as seditious -- sedition statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6159.889" offset="24639530">I think it would be well to note that the statutes by name and by constant reiteration by legist -- the statement of legislative purpose in the preamble are concerned not with sedition generally which make under Pennsylvania versus Nelson be an appropriate area for state action today, tomorrow but it was an attempt to control the activities of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="6187.602" offset="24750393">This is not some San Antonio Anarchy Society.</text>
            <text syncTime="6194.545" offset="24778083">This is -- it is asserted, the activities of the Texas Communist Party an affiliate or the branch of the United States Communist Party which this Court has found to be -- have as its purpose the overthrow of the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6213.628" offset="24854465">Counsel made a reference to -- I thought they were arguing our side of the case when they said that a series of acts directed against Texas would be the normal way of overthrowing the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6228.844" offset="24915278">Indeed, I think that so, and that is the very reason these Texas statutes and other state statutes which are directed as I say, not at sedition generally but at control of Communist activities should be declared unconstitutional by reason of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="6252.001" offset="25007961">I could illustrate that perhaps by talking about Communist blowing up things or inciting riots as was illustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6260.947" offset="25043696">There is no argument made here that the states can't, in the normal exercise of their police power, break up riots.</text>
            <text syncTime="6269.647" offset="25078491">There isn't -- there is -- if someone is killed in a bombing by a Communist, he is guilty of murder and should be prosecuted for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6278.239" offset="25112869">But if he's activities as a Communist are the -- in other words if the -- if he -- if the state seeks to punish him not for the murder, not for the violence, not for the destruction of property, but ecause of Communist activities, we say that the state has acted beyond the limits of its authority and power.</text>
