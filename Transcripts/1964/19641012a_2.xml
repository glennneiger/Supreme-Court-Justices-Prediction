            <text syncTime="1501.884" offset="6110960">One justification of the state's power to arrest then convict a sit-in demonstrator in the face of the Fourteenth Amendment has been that the Negro would-be patron has not demonstrated that he is entitled to service.</text>

            <text syncTime="1631.241" offset="6628289">And in criminal cases, the further thrust of our jurisprudence is that at least reasonable doubts will be resolved in favor of defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.041" offset="6663502">The argument may be made that because we have an asserted divestment of state authority by federal law, the delicacy of the Federal State Relationship Council's caution in reaching the conclusion that the 1964 Act restrains the continued prosecution of those whose offenses predate the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.277" offset="6744482">But the real question is whether following enactment of the 1964 Act, any state constitutionally retains power to persist in regulating through continued prosecution and punishment the behavior which had been taken under direct federal control by the federal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.915" offset="6811042">We submit the federal act strip the states of such power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.667" offset="6826088">In answer to questions earlier, I stated our position on this point, and that is that the action of the Congress under the Commerce Clause with respect to a power that the states have exercised only because Congress over the years has permitted them either by intention or sovereign or otherwise they exercise it, is now such a paramount exercise of federal power that the states have had authority taken from them in this just as the Congress had authority taken from it by the passage of the repeal amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.859" offset="6954820">Now, Congress could have narrowed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by expressed limitation for the limited purpose of letting states impose punishment in cases like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.576" offset="7009677">It could've affected such a limitation just s Chief -- Justice Hughes pointed out in the Chambers case it could've done in connection with the prohibition amendment, but Congress didn't do this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1781.554" offset="7229628">That's quite right and states have -- but we submit there's even more than the constitutional consideration than the -- what we call the common law federal statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.032" offset="7307473">Congress has enacted a savings clause, Section 109 of Title 1, and what that savings clause deals with, and it's been on the books for a long time is perhaps quite indicative of what Congress did not intend to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.519" offset="7365465">Of course there've been cases in connection with 109 over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.768" offset="7382392">Now, Section 109 which is the federal savings clause does not apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.745" offset="7410395">First of all Section 109 applies only to state -- or I'm sorry, is only federal statute, does not apply to state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.658" offset="7446026">Secondly, Section 109 deals only with repeals, and in the Chambers case and in Mr. Justice Brennan's opinion in Bell against Maryland demonstrate that what has occurred here is not a repeal but something else, something which may be characterized as substitution of a right for a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.012" offset="7519378">Finally, Section 109 allows for exceptions even for those statutes which have been repealed, assuming that you wanted to call this a repealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.237" offset="7552293">And Section 203 (c) would be such an exception even if this could be called a repeal and even if it did apply to state judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.849" offset="7582804">Section 203 (c) provides that no person shall punish any person for exercising any right or privilege secured by Section 201 or 202.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.394" offset="7624913">And we have an argument in our brief that is -- there's no point in going over here, but they're canvassing the various dictionaries and so forth the meaning of the word secure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.919" offset="7675068">The legislative history indicates the word right was not used in the strictly jural sense, even though they're obviously were Fourteenth Amendment rights covered by the Act now that were covered earlier so -- but it was used in some certain morals and since that legislative history is set forth at length in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.679" offset="7738075">So if you view it, 109 is applying to state judgments and you view this as a repeal, Section 203 is an explicit exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.322" offset="7792619">But we think Section 203 (c) has even more force than that, because if there's going to be a punishment there's no problem of retroactivity that punishment is going to occur in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.792" offset="7830549">And Section 203 (c), even if we fall into the use of the words perspective and retroactive, is applying to something that's going to happen prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.785" offset="7874539">It says no one shall be punished for exercising rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.042" offset="7887496">These rights sometimes are legal, sometimes are moral, even predating the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.506" offset="7905364">And we would submit that 203 (c) would cover the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.328" offset="7928665">Now, even if our argument that the federal act wipes this all out doesn't apply, the federal statute is the law of South Carolina just as any federal treaty is the law of the state, constitution as the law of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.572" offset="8009644">Cases of this Court (Inaudible) Hallenstein v. Lyman (ph), and other cases have made this abundantly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.694" offset="8046111">The law of South Carolina, we've argued and this conceded in the brief for the State of South Carolina is that if this were South Carolina public accommodation statute, it would have to abate under South Carolina law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.165" offset="8088012">Except that South Carolina has an argument that, I trust this Court will not accept, and that is that even were this incident to occur today these petitioners could be prosecuted for trespass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.671" offset="8138062">South Carolina argues that if they're told they can't be served, they have to go out and file an action for an injunction, if they don't, they're trespassers.</text>

            <text syncTime="5653.916">Like the preceding case, these petitioners also contend that Title II mandates a reversal of the judgments below and the remanding of these cases for dismissal as a matter of federal law pursuant to the unique legislative phenomenon rule annunciated by this Court in Bell against Maryland and in accordance with the expressed terms of Section 203 (c) of Title II which we have just referred to permitting punishment for exercising the right to equal treatment in places of public accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5702.414">The argument just made by Mr. Greenberg of course in the preceding case with respect to this we adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5710.481">But I'd like to point out that Arkansas like Maryland and unlike South Carolina does have a saving clause statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5724.851">In fact they have two which relate to this problem and these statutes appear on pages 6 and 7 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5733.798">Unlike Maryland however, these Arkansas statutes refer only to repeal of any criminal or penal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5745.435">Consequently, if this Court for some reason should not agree with the petitioner's argument that Title II has the effect of compelling a reversal of these convictions as a matter of federal law and a remand of these cases for dismissal, then these cases may be subject to the same disposition made by this Court in Bell against Maryland that is a remand to the highest court of the state for consideration of the effect of the enactment of Title II on these convictions as a matter of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5786.297">It may very well, be as this Court held in Bell against Maryland that the Supreme Court of Arkansas, whose judgment this Court is now asked to review, might hold the enactment of Title II substituting a crime, a right rather for a crime and vice versa is a unique legislative phenomenon in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5810.572">And consequently, these convictions are outside of Arkansas' general saving clause statutes which relate only to repeal of criminal statutes, thus leaving the Supreme Court of Arkansas to hold applicable to these cases the common law rule requiring dismissal of a pending criminal proceeding whenthe legislature removes the state's condemnation from conduct that was formerly being criminal.</text>

            <text syncTime="5871.660">As a part of the State of Arkansas, as I've indicated, Title II not only removes Arkansas' condemnation of petitioner's conduct which was peacefully seeking food service in a department store and refusing to leave the lunch counter when ordered to do so by the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5891.440">But it precludes Arkansas from now imposing upon petitioners Lupper and Robinson of $500 fine and a 30 day prison term, that's what these petitioners' fate in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="6085.437">We say first, if this Court determines that enactment of the Civil Rights Act results in abatement of state prosecutions as a matter of federal law, then these convictions must be reversed and remanded for dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6105.446">We say secondly that if this Court in interpreting Section 203 (c) determines that the states cannot carry out punishment even though the act of sitting in took place prior to adoption of the Civil Rights Act then these convictions must also be reversed here and remanded for dismissal below.</text>
            <text syncTime="6138.289">Now, our third position is that if this Court determines as a matter of federal law that there is no mandatory abatement of state criminal proceedings, then the cases would have to be remanded with instructions for the state court to determine the effect of its law of abatement in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="6164.788">Now, Mr. Greenberg has already pointed out, South Carolina does not have a saving clause and therefore the Civil Rights Act in that state interpret it as a part of the law of that state, these decisions would abate because the common law would be applicable and the state -- on the state law they would abate and the State of South Carolina could not discriminate against a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6200.567">In Arkansas on the other hand, there is a saving statute and therefore it's a question of statutory interpretation if repeal means the same thing as repeal in the federal statute then the Supreme Court of Arkansas might hold that these convictions abate because there is no statute saving the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6235.133">If not, then the proceedings do not abate and of course that would be a question of state law and the law of the state, they would not abate and then we could not come back here on that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="7148.137">They went into a discussion of custom and the testimony of the manager was, in the South Carolina case if that was what he was following, the officer also said there's no law, it's custom.</text>
            <text syncTime="7166.281">I would like to move now to petitioner's due process claims in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7174.240">Petitioners' claims with respect to due process are the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="7179.635">First, these petitioners claim that there is no evidence in the record in this case to convict petitioners of failing to obey the store manager's order to leave the premises since no such order was in fact given, the only order given being an order to leave the luncheon area.</text>
            <text syncTime="7204.584">The second claim is that the plain words of the trespass statute here under which petitioners were convicted gave no fair warning that a failure to obey an order to leave the luncheon area was tantamount to a failure to obey an order to leave the premises which is the effect of the affirmance of petitioners' convictions here by the Arkansas Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7234.233">As in the previous case, these petitioners are two Negro college students attending college in Little Rock and on April 13, 1960, they went into Blass' department store in Little Rock.</text>
            <text syncTime="7250.082">When these petitioners arrived, as I've said earlier, they were observed by police Officer Bair who followed them along with a few other Negro students into the store and observed them sitting themselves in the luncheon area located on the mezzanine level.</text>
            <text syncTime="7268.662">Officer Bair immediately left the store and reported his observations to police headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="7275.127">Two other police officers were sent to by headquarters to join Officer Bair.</text>
            <text syncTime="7280.983">The manager of the store, Mr. Holt, observed as he said, “five Negro boys sitting in the lunch room, three at the counter and two sat at the table.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7296.501">He then testified that he told each one of them in turn that he didn't want any disturbance and asked them to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="7304.458">They refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="7306.139">The manager left the store and across the street found Police Captain Terrell and Lieutenant Talbot.</text>
            <text syncTime="7313.751">The mnager returned to the store with the police officer and identified petitioner as being among the five Negro boys he had asked to leave the lunch area.</text>
            <text syncTime="7323.527">Petitioners were on the main floor on their way out at this time, which was two to five minutes after the original encounter with the manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="7333.731">The incident took place between 11:30 and 12:00.</text>
            <text syncTime="7337.697">The assistant store manager as I said before testified that he too saw these boys and he said to one of them not the petitioner that, “We're just not prepared to serve you would you please excuse yourself?”</text>
            <text syncTime="7352.629">None of the officers actually heard the manager order these petitioners to leave the premises, but Captain Terrell testified on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7365.803">And on page 29 of the record, in two places, Captain Terrell said this, “He” referring to the manager “had requested our assistance to get them out from the lunch counter when he came over to get us”.</text>
            <text syncTime="7388.211">Then Captain Terrell said on the same page, “He told us that he had two boys that had refused to leave the lunch counter and asked that we assist them”.</text>
            <text syncTime="7400.028">In short, there's no testimony in this record to support any finding that the petitioners were asked to leave the premises as required by the statute here for conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="7419.741">Petitioners were at all times orderly and they were arrested on an open charge and then they were --</text>

            <text syncTime="8074.337">I, with the Attorney General and his staff of course represent the respondent in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="8081.011">I think it proper that I mention at the outset that any lack of convincing quality in the brief from my oral argument I hope it is not based upon reasons or authority thereof but maybe my own in that missing -- the feeling that every young advocate may have at his baptism before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8101.451">I think that petitioners and their several eminent counsel ought to be congratulated, perhaps envied on the magnificent job they've done in both the preparing their brief in this effective oral presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="8114.501">But I necessarily disagree with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="8117.321">I think it proper that certain aspects of the record before this case be emphasized before I embark on the argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="8135.678">It does have a mezzanine tearoom that does serve luncheons.</text>
            <text syncTime="8139.995">And I certainly didn't mislead -- intend to mislead Mr. Justice Stewart by saying they just serve salads, they do have light luncheons in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="8149.639">But if you can imagine at just very briefly this is the type of place where during the serving hours a young lady comes out and models sweaters and skirts and other female attired to their customers that are seated there wherein they're almost all women that use this facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="8168.519">Now, these demonstrators came in and they weren't just five, they were five there perhaps when Mr. Holt came back or came upstairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="8176.978">But there were 15 or so demonstrators who came here and they strategically placed themselves across this narrow entrance at the tables and at the counters.</text>
            <text syncTime="8187.138">They were courteously asked to leave by the store personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="8191.819">They refused to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="9955.670">There have been a number of cases which dramatically points this out.</text>
            <text syncTime="9959.293">This Court denied certiorari, I think back in 1949, when the federal statutes were changed to -- from permitting imprisonment for rape at either death or life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="9971.978">After the charge, it went back for retrial and they argued that the jury be instructed to provide for a lesser term of years that the court be so -- the jury be so instructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="9984.820">The court refused to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="9986.718">I think there's a significant difference in a man being fined $500 and given 30 days and not permitting the jury to give him some term of (Inaudible) -- years but serving a life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="9998.777">There are numerous analogies here -- the violations of the Emergency Price Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="10007.388">I don't think there's any question at this statute that we could twist it so it'd have federal origin, it would not have been abate -- abated under the federal saving statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="10018.552">I don't believe that the Supremacy Clause of the United States constitution has given such an interpretation that we're going to treat states one way, and federal laws another way.</text>

            <text syncTime="10069.200">If you look at that statute, it was enacted within three years at Plessy v. Ferguson, and one that -- and it held that -- what this Court hold -- held at that time, I think a real fine analogy.</text>

            <text syncTime="10118.416">Look at those cases, I invite the attention of the Court to see those cases where the community leaders, the Chamber of Commerce, the police officers all acted to enforce the law and I think that they have.</text>

            <text syncTime="10175.378">There was no proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="10177.100">There was something -- some mere inference in their motion for new trial they wouldn't even argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="10183.215">And if this had been a jury discrimination case, this Court would hold consistent with its holdings in hundreds of other cases that these matters have to be brought to the state court's attention.</text>

            <text syncTime="10352.538">I think Shelley v. Kraemer confirms the fact that an individual has a right to discriminate if he so desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="10359.904">I understand Shelley v. Kraemer to say two or three different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="10363.115">The first is that a state court cannot require a person to discriminate if he does not wish to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="10370.003">Also, Shelley v. Kraemer was determined, in part at least, upon the federal given right of colored people to deal in property as white men.</text>

            <text syncTime="11330.891">On page 47 on direct examination, he was asked by the state's attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="11336.996">Question, “About how long would you say you were gone from when you left to go to get the officers until you came back?</text>
            <text syncTime="11346.280">How many minutes would you say approximately?”</text>
            <text syncTime="11349.208">Answer “Oh, two or three minutes I guess, perhaps five no more”.</text>
            <text syncTime="11354.273">And then on cross-examination by these petitioners' counsel, he was asked that question again and he was asked this question by Mr. Anderson.</text>

            <text syncTime="11382.081">Answer “Something like that”.</text>
            <text syncTime="11384.407">So that was gone over with the manager and locations as to the time element involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="11390.161">And then the manager seems to be quite sure that there were only five Negro boys involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="11397.066">On page 46 of the record, he states what he observed and he said, “There were five Negro boys”.</text>
            <text syncTime="11404.770">And then again on page 51, again on the cross-examination, he was asked “Now, again, how many colored men were there?”</text>
