            <text syncTime="48.558" offset="194142">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.421" offset="205636">The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue oil and gas leases on the public lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.345" offset="245342">By its terms, that statute is fully applicable to areas that have been withdrawn or set aside for use as wildlife refuges.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.180" offset="284630">This case involves the validity of oil and gas leases issued by the Secretary of Interior under that Act and the Kenai National Moose Range in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.743" offset="338965">At page 17 of the record, you'll find a map of the Kenai Peninsula and the insert at the lower right shows the relationship of the Peninsula to Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.287" offset="397061">The larger map shows the boundaries of the Moose Range on the Peninsula.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.083" offset="424229">The Moose Range was created in 1941 by order of President Roosevelt which set it aside for the use by the Department of the Interior as a refuge for wildlife, primarily for the giant Kenai moose.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.751" offset="494968">This large exhibit involves and furnished to do with individual copies of the same exhibit for your convenience but it shows the Moose Range divided into three separate parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.611" offset="550348">Each of which has a somewhat different status.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.707" offset="562782">The one on the right, that large area which we have labeled area one was withdrawn by the original Executive Order 1941, Executive Order 8979 withdrew that area and only that area from a settlement, location, sale or entry or other disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.028" offset="652016">And the basic question in the case will be what that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.876" offset="671451">The two areas on the right -- I'm sorry, on the left, your left were accepted from the original order.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.070" offset="712202">However, the one on the bottom which we call area two was seven years later withdrawn by a public land order issued by the Secretary of Interior is at that time was withdrawn from settlement location, sale or entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.336" offset="789316">The third area, top on the left, area three, was never withdrawn by either order.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.750" offset="818991">It in fact is wholly irrelevant to this case and we have it there only for the sake of completeness and I won't -- again refer to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.258" offset="852950">The colored areas on the map represent oil and gas leases, leases issued by the Secretary of the Department of Interior, all on applications which were filed during 1954 and 1955.</text>

            <text syncTime="740.449" offset="2961763">What the Court of Appeals held was that the Executive Order that created the range in 1941 which withdrew the lands from settlement location, sale or entry or other disposition whose other language I'll deal with later, in effect closed the area to leasing it, prohibited leasing in that area and so the earlier applications were invalidly filed and the leases issued on them were nullities.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.814" offset="3079210">Now, it also held that the -- some regulations which I'll come to later also, they were issued in 1958 and an implementing order have the effect of opening the range to leasing and therefore, the -- the Tallman group as those first to file after the range was opened, became entitled to the leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.441" offset="3173669">Now, I already generally -- the ultimate question is the interpretation of the Executive Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.093" offset="3204284">But that is not a question to be decided by the Court in the first instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1077.559" offset="4310204">The -- as I say, the range was covered with applications in 1954 and 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.270" offset="4332983">But action was -- the final action, they were exempted for filing but filed action on the application was withheld under this suspension directive not to take file action because of a possible revision of regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.696" offset="4386691">And there the matter stood until 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.896" offset="4399543">In 1956, some bills were introduced in Congress to restrict by statute leasing in wildlife refuges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.016" offset="4432039">This is across the country not just the Moose Range.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.043" offset="4448131">The committees did not report out the bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.279" offset="4461087">However, the House Committee noted in its report that an understanding had been reached between the Committee and the Secretary whereby the Secretary would not issue any more leases in wildlife refuges without first advising the Committee and asking for its approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.063" offset="4536216">So, in July 1956 -- June 1956, the Secretary submitted to the Committee a proposal to lease, to issue leases on the Swanson River Unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.656" offset="4586580">That's the dark area up at the top.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.427" offset="4601626">The Committee held public hearings on the proposal and ultimately in July, advised the Secretary by letter that the Committee was in unanimous agreement that issuing those leases would not be detrimental to wildlife uses and they might properly go ahead and issue those leases without awaiting the final resolution of the policies generally to be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.219" offset="4692846">So in September 1956, leases in fact were issued in the Swanson River Unit which is the dark area on the top.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.161" offset="4728581">That's a large area at 71,000 acres over 100 square miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.491" offset="4753868">Now, under those leases oil was discovered in July 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.500" offset="4789917">That was responsible -- that discovery lead to the development of this oil field which is shown by the custard dots.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.148" offset="4828578">And mind you, all of these was during the time that the Court of Appeals holds that the range was closed leasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.561" offset="4858149">Now, the next thing that happened is that in 1958, the new set of regulations was finally issued in an implementing order specifically applicable to the Kenai range was issued which became effective August 14th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.344" offset="4937352">Now, what the order did was to in effect, we -- well, we say what it did was to close the lower half of the range.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.969" offset="4987820">It forbad any leasing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.822" offset="4999210">And this part of the range down at the bottom is outlined in the heavy line also in a small piece over the top.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.847" offset="5031288">But it directed that the pending applications now be acted on and so promptly after that, they acted on all the pending applications and then in the next few months issued, I think it's 294 leases covering 620,000 acres on the application that have been filed back in 1954 or 1955, leasing thereby substantially the whole range that was still available for leasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.533" offset="5150093">Among those leases were the leases involved in this case issued to the Griffin applicants and the status then is exactly the same as the status of all of the other leases that were issued at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1522.014" offset="6087993">They simply reflect the longstanding interpretation of the Executive Order as never having part of any leasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.698" offset="6118713">Now, the regulation, I'd like to go back a bit on the regulation that the 1955 version of the regulations, we think at equally confirmation of the Secretary's interpretation of the Executive Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.796" offset="6179109">The regulations begin at page 3A of the government's brief, in the appendix to the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.916" offset="6223621">Now, what the regulations are the Mineral Leasing Act itself applies to wildlife refuges generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.140" offset="6252460">But it's not mandatory, it just gives the Secretary the power and he therefore has discretion to limit leasing any place in the public domain and this regulation states the departmental policy on leasing in wildlife refuges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.624" offset="6322469">There's no doubt he has the power so to limit or control leasing in wildlife refuges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.743" offset="6346919">So the original one was issued 1947 and it said very little.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.716" offset="6362802">It simply said that oil and gas -- that no oil and gas leases may be issued in the wildlife refuge unless it's subject to a unit plan and no drilling or prospecting under the lease may be conducted without the consent of the Secretary on the advice of the Fish and Wildlife Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.137" offset="6436467">Now, as I say in 1953, August of 1953, they took under -- or they took under advisement and study whether they shouldn't revise the leasing policies and restrict leasing in wildlife refuges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.018" offset="6499997">I might say the evolution of these regulations can be seen as a competing forces between those who are in favor of conservation and those who are in favor of development of minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.179" offset="6556630">And even to say, they have quite different views about the extent to which leasing is compatible with wildlife uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.195" offset="6584738">And I might anticipate the end by saying that ultimately the conservation has went out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.070" offset="6604278">And except for Alaska, the new regulations would bid leasing altogether in wildlife refuges but I'll come to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.596" offset="6638341">Now, in 1955, a new version of the regulation was issued in December 8, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.107" offset="6672405">And it's set out on page 4A and 5A of our appendix and I would like to emphasize this because it's the first formal document of the Secretary which expressly, we think, or virtually expressly does treat the range as open to leasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.776" offset="6755056">The operative provision is paragraph B and it treats with three categories of lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.263" offset="6789016">The first sentence says that areas determined to be indispensable for the preservation of endangered species and the like are not available for leasing at all, and areas in that category are included in Appendix A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.249" offset="6852963">And Appendix A, they enlisted a few, did not mention Kenai range.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.758" offset="6870936">The next sentence begins, “Oil and gas leases may be issued for other lands administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service for wildlife conservation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.429" offset="6909701">Now, I would like to stop there for a moment, it goes on to say that literally that would include the Moose Range.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.468" offset="6937809">It says, “Any areas administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service for wildlife conservation,” and it goes on, “except that”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.351" offset="6969365">What follows is an exception from that statement that leases may be issued, “Except that on those areas designated by the Fish and Wildlife Service as wilderness, recreational, water development or marsh with respect to which it determines that oil and gas development might seriously impair or destroy the usefulness of the lands for wildlife conservation purposes, no leases will be issued unless the service first approves a detailed program together with safeguards.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.919" offset="7099664">Areas in this category are listed in Appendix B and over in the next page 5A, Appendix B includes this item, Kenai.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.967" offset="7143863">The following areas in all lands within one mile of Tustumena Lake, Skilak Lake, Kenai River, Upper and Lower Russian Lake -- River, Hidden Lake, Kasilof River, and Chickaloon Flat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.148" offset="7188584">Those parts all within the range of -- some of them show in the map.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.304" offset="7205198">They're all within the range were designated mind you, to exempt them from provision that oil and gas leases may be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.496" offset="7241979">They were designated as areas in which leasing might seriously impair or destroy wildlife conservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.725" offset="7274893">Now, I suggest that it make -- it would make a certainty of the regulation if they did not necessarily assume that the whole range was open to leasing and it was accepting the rivers, lakes, and marshlands as areas in which because of their special sensitivity that's where fish and wildlife are bound, no leasing will be permitted except on a very stringent conditions.Now what the respondent --</text>

            <text syncTime="2101.415" offset="8405577">But they didn't specifically refer to Kenai Range as the 1955 regulation did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.672" offset="8422609">So I think the 1955 regulation is very explicit in treating the range as a whole as open to leasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.581" offset="8446224">Now, respondent's final argument on that is to say well if it does it opens them henceforth and doesn't say anything about the status and the year previous to that when the applications were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.381" offset="8505469">Now, I suggest a number of reasons why that is not a permissible reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.304" offset="8521143">It certainly had that the Secretary intended this as a modification of the Executive Order and not an interpretation of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.865" offset="8559386">He would first of all have used the Public Land Order which is what the delegation said they should use for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.820" offset="8579239">And secondly, he would have done it by indirections, see, I got then that the inference by the exception and if he thought he was changing the status he wouldn't do it by indirection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.676" offset="8626678">And I think it's perfectly clear that this is based on his construction of the Executive Order as not barring mineral leasing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2173.201" offset="8692715">Oh, I would think by -- with -- that this 1955 regulation as the plain interpretation of the Executive Order, arguably at least would ratify the action of the land office in accepting the leases or the applications for filing but we've not made that argument and I don't want to make it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.906" offset="8775576">Now, when these new regulations were issued, one they didn't promised, it didn't satisfy anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.014" offset="8796056">It's still permitted too much leak and immediately Congress started to conduct hearings on the statute restricting leasing even further and it was then that they entered the agreement that they didn't report a bill but they agreed that the Secretary wouldn't issue anymore leasing -- leases in the meantime without first consulting the Committee and it's that time that they leased the Swanson River Unit with the prior approval of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.928" offset="8903680">So they took the regulations under study again and finally in 1958, they came out with a brand new version of the regulations, and that begins at page 6A of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.725" offset="8954880">Now, this regulation is an almost complete victory for the coservationist forces.</text>

            <text syncTime="2662.590" offset="10650331">They say what that means is that these two areas over here, area three and area two, where area three, no order ever withdrawn at it all, they could have filed it any time, it was unaffected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.889" offset="10711458">Though as a part f the refuge action would have been suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.786" offset="10727131">But you could apply at anytime and they said well also area two withdrawn in 1948, that withdrawal order was revoked in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.957" offset="10763807">After 1955, this area they say, well, admittedly after 1955 this is -- and they say this reference is way to these pending applications in those two areas and not to all the applications in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.465" offset="10825770">Now, I will refer the Court to the press release issued -- I think I'm going to say so that it obviously is not limited to that, so I'm referring with press release at page -- quoted at page 23 of our brief in the footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.112" offset="10884389">On July 25, 1958, this is just before this order was announced, the Secretary issued a press release announcing the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.682" offset="10922632">And what he said in the press release was that most of these lands that are available under this new order are now covered by applications that will be adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.092" offset="10968294">He acknowledged it on the issue as in fact all of the lands have already been filed on and the fact that you can now find new offers shouldn't be taking the promise very much because the whole area was already filed on and I think it's perfectly saying that throughout the regulations have treated and assumed that the range was open to leasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.130" offset="11052513">One other point, well we don't have an argument that the Congress in fact endorsed that interpretation when the 1958 Act did added to the leases navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.134" offset="11108519">I don't want to go to that now, it's in our brief but I'm just taking note of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.759" offset="11122939">And then I would like to turn to the language in the Executive Order to see if it can be read to support the Secretary's interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.653" offset="11162540">The full text appears in the respondent's brief, this yellow brief, we didn't print the full text so I used his, it's on page -- it begins at page 1A.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.378" offset="11201411">And the withdrawal of provision, however, begins -- the withdrawal of provision begins at the bottom of page 2A and carries over the top of page 3A.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.837" offset="11259298">I want to emphasize that I post this with the guise loaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.552" offset="11278106">The Secretary has already interpreted it and his interpretation noted, it's been acted on, it's been relied on, the Congress as in effect approved it and I don't know what interest would become vested in any other meaning of the words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.832" offset="11335262">And if there's any basis for the Secretary's interpretation it seems to me that a case by one in which that interpretation should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.334" offset="11377267">What we're looking for is something to support his interpretation not whether we can criticize it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2921.274" offset="11685094">Now, settlement, location, sale or entry or terms that are in the land law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.652" offset="11706514">A settlement is what you do when you are homestead and you go on settle on the land and become entitled to a patent on to the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.175" offset="11736607">A location is a mining location, you go out and stake out in location and record it and then if you discover mineral, you become entitled to a patent to the land as well as the minerals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.250" offset="11776940">And an entry is using a variety of ways which primarily of the initial act of settling for example, if you enter up on the lands or open the entry intending to settle and acquire title under the Homestead laws, you'll have a protected right to prefecture the right by staying on and that's generally on entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.983" offset="11855830">Now, sale means I think it has no definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.107" offset="11864398">Now, all of those four things plainly aren't involved complete alienations of the government's title.</text>
