            <text syncTime="266.633" offset="1066527">Your Honor, the reason that we raised this in our brief and I will address myself immediately to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.277" offset="1093068">Initially this case was a case of simple -- simply the case of whether King should be liable where he had followed the orders of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.068" offset="1136222">In the complaint, paragraphs 14 and 15 of the complaint say that King distributed -- he distributed a $160,000 as distributing agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.934" offset="1179690">Then they go on to say this was in violation of Section 192.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.681" offset="1198707">In the answer which the defendant made in that case, we said that King followed explicitly the orders of the Court and therefore shouldn't be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.683" offset="1242697">On this narrow issue, we preceded to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.721" offset="1262864">In the District Court, we had a stip -- a -- well, first of all we had a pretrial conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.957" offset="1283762">Then there was a stipulation of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.670" offset="1294629">In both the pretrial conference and the stipulation of fact, the -- absolutely the only issue was whether King as a distributing agent who distributed under orders of the Court was liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.801" offset="1347187">We reached the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.645" offset="1362547">We -- and the -- there, we -- the Court found that there -- reversed Judge Wortendyke in the District Court and stated that that -- well, several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.261" offset="1420957">First of all they indicated that although Crocker and Stephens which are the two cases in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.255" offset="1452931">And by reason of which I believe this Court took cognizance of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.781" offset="1483024">They said although in the -- the Third Circuit opinion, they said although these cases are helpful, they're not determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.726" offset="1510818">And then they found -- they made some statements such as that there was -- that negligence in the case at bar is apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.404" offset="1541538">Then Judge Biggs who is writing the opinion of the Court, said -- made a further statement, the equities are not with King in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.181" offset="1592633">It seemed to us from this opinion that we had gone entirely off the subject of the initial District Court opinion and the findings of that Court as well as the stipulation of facts as well as the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.146" offset="1656581">We felt that the Third Circuit Court was trying to hold Mr. King on some other basis and possibly raise him from the stature of a distributing agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.952" offset="1703706">We -- so that at that point, we went back to the statutes and the cases and dug into them much more deeply and try to read these -- the cases that have been interpreted 191 and 192.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.397" offset="1777580">And we did bring up these other issues.I do not propose to argue them here Your Honor unless you wish me to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1952.671" offset="7810612">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.542" offset="7826077">As we understand it on the faces of the petitioner's argument this morning, they recognized that the first, the second, and third questions which were presented in their brief in the merits, not properly before this Court because they were not raised in the petition for certiorari or indeed in either of the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.205" offset="7920744">For that reason if the Court pleases, I will confine myself to the single question which is properly before this Court as having been raised in the petition for certiorari, and having been an issue in the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.497" offset="7977900">That question if the Court pleases is whether a distributing agent appointed in a Chapter 11 arrangement, who fails to honor the Government's debt priority under Section 191, subjects himself to personal liability under Section 192 for the amount of the Government's indebtedness that was entitled priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.814" offset="8071210">Now the question as it arises in the context of this case breaks down into two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.189" offset="8092735">The first part is the part to which Mr. Justice Harlan referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.110" offset="8108408">Namely, are fiduciaries of this type called in this case the distributing agent, are fiduciaries of this type within the reach of Section 192 at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.093" offset="8160340">Now then on this question, there is concededly a conflict between the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.550" offset="8186149">And indeed it is because of this conflict that the United States acquiesces in the petition and presumably it was because of this conflict that this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.701" offset="8226795">The second question is, assuming that distributing agents, this type of fiduciary, comes within the range or reach of Section 192 is that the defense in an action of this kind that the distribution made by the fiduciary was pursuant to a Court approved order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.902" offset="8323553">Now it is the position, if the Court pleases, of the United States first that as the court below held Section 192 does reach fiduciaries such as Mr. King.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.762" offset="8370991">And secondly that in the circumstances of this case, admitted circumstances of this case, it is no defense that Mr. King's payments were under a plan of distribution which had ben approved by the referee.</text>

            <text syncTime="2115.988" offset="8463882">Your Honor, we would suggest this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.982" offset="8475899">And that is that if the plan of arrangement is approved by the referee, first with full knowledge of the fact that there is a priority claim in the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.507" offset="8549982">And second, with the United States having been given notice by the debtor or by the distributing agent of the fact that this plan arrangement is being considered for confirmation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.804" offset="8607138">If then the Court or the referee were to disregard the Government's priority with full knowledge of the existence of the priority, and with the full opportunity to the United States to defend this priority claim before the referee in that limited of circumstances, we've indicated in our brief, we would concede that the distributing agent would not be liable for executing the Court's orders.</text>

            <text syncTime="2176.784" offset="8707135">That is correct Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.907" offset="8711628">Now that is quite a different case from that which is presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.137" offset="8732526">I might point out that the Bankruptcy Act itself in Chapter 11 specifically makes provision for priority claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.368" offset="8777456">Section 337 for example provides that the debtor shall deposit the money necessary to pay all debts which have priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.815" offset="8811207">Section 367 (2) provides that upon confirmation of the arrangement, the money which the debtor has deposited for priority debts shall be dispersed to the persons entitled thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.563" offset="8862198">So there is a contemplation in the Act itself that the debtor as a condition proceeding to the approval of his plan of arrangement shall deposit the moneys which are necessary to pay off priority claims and upon confirmation of the arrangements, those claims will be paid properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.037" offset="8928131">Now the order which appointed Mr. King in this case, which appears at page 11 of the record, directed the debtors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.020" offset="8956029">This is the corporation of which Mr. King was the president to deposit with Mr. King the moneys necessary to pay all debts which have priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.113" offset="8996362">So this was of course executing the provisions of Section 337.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.945" offset="9015693">Now what happened in this case was the plan of arrangement, amended plan of arrangement, came on for confirmation and at that point the referee raised the matter of this priority claim of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.363" offset="9069401">And as the Court has noted itself, Mr. Freeman, the counsel for the debtor, specifically stated that there would be at all times $94,000 available to pay that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.975" offset="9123840">Now the referee has stated, and this can be found on page 16 of the record, that the confirmation on his part was conditioned upon a provision or payment of the Government's claim if allowable up to $94,000, this was pursuant to what Mr. Freeman had stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.519" offset="9194057">The result of it here is that there was a plain violation by Mr. King of his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.829" offset="9223314">When he drew up these checks and presented them to the referee for countersigning without having seen to it that the debt of the United States was protected as Mr. Freeman has stated it would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.169" offset="9296666">But we would say here tat the game that the issue of knowledge, the issue of whether or not there has been plans with the order that would come in again only in the context of whether a -- it is a defense that there was a court order under which the payments had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.324" offset="9405231">And again we would say there that it is only a defense in the limited circumstance where the referee has been advised of the priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.214" offset="9440758">When he entered the order, he's aware of the actual state of affairs and where he chooses to -- the reasons best known to himself, not to honor the referee that is, not to honor the Government's priority and honoring his order, and the United States as I say, has had notice and has an opportunity to convince the referee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.716" offset="9514841">Now the really basic question that we think that is before the Court is the question which is presented by the question rather which relates to the coverage of Section 192 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.283" offset="9573042">Does Section 192 extend to fiduciaries such as Mr. King?</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.521" offset="9601985">Now it's the Government's position stated that the court below was quite correct in rejecting the position as we understand it of the petitioners that Section 192 does not reach a court appointed fiduciary unless he is one of the court appointed -- types of court appointed fiduciaries or designated ao nominee in Section 192 itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.093" offset="9712327">Now we think that the starting point in any discussion of the reach of Section 192 must be this Court's consistent recognition that Section 192 is (Inaudible) with Section 191.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.057" offset="9772199">As the Court is aware, both of these Sections date back to the early days of the republic and manifest the firmly rooted legislative interest in securing and protecting the public revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.050" offset="9820160">As such, this Court has held that both Sections are to be liberally construed to effectuate their objectives not only Section 191 which establishes the Government's debt priority but also Section 192 which subjects to personal liability any person who pays the debtor's debts in disregard of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2522.864" offset="10091416">But in most of these cases, I doubt that the question of fraud could -- the issue of fraud could be established by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.336" offset="10121300">Here for example, there's no contest that Mr. King was a creditor of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.795" offset="10147109">The question here as in most of these cases is whether or not or -- wasn't the absence of any fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.208" offset="10168738">The claim of the United States is going to be satisfied first as the statute directs that it shall be satisfied if it is entitled priority.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan S. Rosenthal</label>
            <text syncTime="2555.333" offset="10221296">Well, we would submit if the Court pleases that in -- that the position that the petitioners take here is that there is an entire class of fiduciaries, namely these fiduciaries who have court appointments and are not designated ao nominee in 192 or outside the reach of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.972" offset="10299873">Now that would mean that there's a whole class of priority debts of United States which have no protection in the absence of a -- at least of the Government's being able to establish fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.586" offset="10362253">Now we think that the argument of the petitioners which does derives support from the Fifth Circuit's decision in United States against Stephens that there is this class of fiduciaries who were outside the ambit of the Act cannot even be squared with the language of Section 192 even if it were to be assumed that this language were to be taken in a vacuum divorced from the legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.788" offset="10463086">Section 192 applies to every executor, administrator, or assignee, or other person who pays any debt due by the person or state for whom or who which he acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.707" offset="10514808">Now as this Court noted in the Bramwell case, this language is very general.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.460" offset="10533825">And it said the generality of it before any person insignificant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.489" offset="10553887">Now, a receiver or distributing agent in this case -- in the context of this case Mr. King is plainly a person who pays the debts of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.904" offset="10587533">And in doing so, we respectfully submit he is acting in the most meaningful sense for the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.567" offset="10614178">Mr. King, we would say was acting clearly on behalf of the debtor corporation in paying its debts in accordance with the plan of distribution which the corporation has prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.839" offset="10655347">Now it's quite true whereas the petitioner's stress that in discharging their functions, a distributing agent or receiver as it was involved in the Stephens case, maybe an officer armed with the Court because he's acting under a court appointment, and additionally is the custodian of property which is under the supervision of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.591" offset="10738312">And we don't think it follows that for the purpose of Section 192 that a fiduciary is to be regarded as actig for the Court rather than for the debtors merely because of his status as the Court or appointee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.124" offset="10792438">And in support of that argument, we don't think we need to go beyond the fact that the administrators are designated ao nominee in Section 192 as being persons who pay the debts of the state for whom they act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.955" offset="10847817">And of course, the Court well knows the administrator coming with a -- Mr. King or a receiver is an officer -- is appointed by the Court and as such is an officer of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.186" offset="10904660">Apart from the terms of the Section, we would say that the construction that the petitioner offers cannot squarely or cannot be squared rather with the underlying legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.688" offset="10946664">I would just point out in that connection that under this construction, there must be imputed to Congress on a petitioner's construction an intent to give a higher dignity to the Government's priority claims against the proceedings of states, insolvent proceedings of the states then against as here an insolvent corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.146" offset="11044571">That follows from the fact that where you have an insolvent proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.034" offset="11060036">He invariably will have an administrator or an executor who are designated ao nominee and therefore within the reach of 192.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.644" offset="11090547">On the other hand, as the petitioner views it, where you're having insolvent corporation anytime that the fiduciary is other than one of the classes of the fiduciaries designated ao nominee and is in addition a court appointee, there's no protection afforded by 192 at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2856.574" offset="11426273">We would say here that these particular facts of this case with this distributing agent who is the president of the debtor corporation put forth the plan of arrangement, that these merely reinforced the fact that in the circumstances of this case, there was a breach of the duty which was owed, the referee, in which would owe the United States on the part of the distributing agent.</text>
