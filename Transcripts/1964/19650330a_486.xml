            <label>Mr. Bernard E. Brandes</label>
            <text syncTime="37.835" offset="151301">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.228" offset="160810">This case is before the Court on certiorari to the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.653" offset="182544">There are two issues involved and the first of the two issues, the same issue is involved in the companion case of the Midland-Ross Corporation in which the government is the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.335" offset="237296">That case follows immediately after this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.904" offset="255582">So far as the first issue was concerned, the facts are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.506" offset="282018">The year involved is the year 1952 and accordingly the provisions of the 1939 Internal Revenue Code apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.114" offset="320366">In that year, the petitioner's here were members of the partnership engaged in the business of dealing in securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.391" offset="357564">In addition, the partnership from time to time purchase securities for its own account as principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.651" offset="390583">In early nine -- commencing in early 1952, the partnership purchased certain securities consisting of promissory notes that had been issued at a discount and did not bear interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.957" offset="451814">It is conceded that these securities were properly identified and marked for investment as is required of a deal of in securities so that they constituted in the hands of the partnership, capital assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.126" offset="520464">These securities were sold after -- certain of these notes were sold in 1952 after they have been held for more than six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.385" offset="561528">And the gain on the sale was reported by the partnership and therefore by the petitioners as a long-term capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.682" offset="598727">On audit, the Internal Revenue Service held that the gain which had been reported on sale as long-term capital gain was in reality interest income and so far as the notes which as of the end of the year had not yet been sold, as to those notes even though they had not yet been sold, there was a requirement for a picking up on a pro rata basis of the discount at which those notes had been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.312" offset="741146">The first issue is therefore a very narrow confined issue with statuary construction under the 1939 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.883" offset="787435">It is an issue that does not exist in the context of this case under the 1954 Code because as we propose to develop the law that has been changed.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="209.925" offset="839680">Properly stated was, the issue is very simple, what under the 1939 Code was the status of issue discount and to what is the answer to that question is to be determined only in the light of the words of the statute as written, in the light of a demonstrated intent of Congress and in the light of such precedent as we have on the issue and so far as precedent is concerned, the only precedent close to this issue consists of decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.437" offset="985652">Now, in the court below and continued here, the respondent has offered a very simple, disarming approach to the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.827" offset="1031210">The respondent's approach basically is, discount is like compensation for the use of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.751" offset="1062975">Interest is also compensation for the use of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.185" offset="1080738">Accordingly, discount and interest must be related and the measure involved of compensation for the use of money must be the measure of ordinary taxable income in the nature of interest that must exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.567" offset="1154194">Now, this approach which I have taken the liberty of terming it a simple and disarmingly simple approach was fully accepted by the court below and so far as we can ascertain from the opinion, the Court did not proceed to examine what it is that we there offered and there offered again by way of material that shows that Congress was aware, that obligations were issued at a discount and was aware that the tax treatment which attached to obligations that were issued at a discount were different.</text>

            <text syncTime="560.262" offset="2240993">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.737" offset="2278922">Turning to what we believe that we are in a position to prove with regard to the intent of Congress in connection with the 1939 Code as in support of our position that under the 1939 Code, unlike under the 1954 Code, issue discount is a capital item.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.002" offset="2375993">We should like to refer to the structure of the statue to the fact that there were specific provisions of the statue which should have been superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.922" offset="2415595">If the rule is as respondent contends namely, if the rule is that issue discount is always an income item.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.247" offset="2460944">We also -- to demonstrate the state of the lower pride to the 1954 Code will show that the administrative practice existing at least prior to 1953 was to regard issue discount as a capital item.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.378" offset="2545476">The capital gains and losses provisions of the 1939 Code are very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.104" offset="2572330">They define capital assets and they further define that any gain realized on the sale of a capital asset is a capital gain and that it is true, is as far as they go and there's -- in that connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.219" offset="2644846">Within that framework if we went no further, it would be very difficult to find why.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.110" offset="2668356">This discount when realized on sale should not be a capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.473" offset="2689881">There was a sale and there was a profit and it was realized after six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.802" offset="2719138">If we are to believe that there are some hidden, ipso limitations on the definition of what constitutes a capital gain, it is most material to observe that within the framework of Section 117, which is the pertinent Section, the Congress has inserted a very explicit exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.025" offset="2816000">Securities that have been -- short-term securities that have been issued at a discount and without interest, the statue goes on to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.788" offset="2855079">By any government, do not constitute capital assets by excluding them from the definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.118" offset="2888411">Congress saw to it that any gain on those securities was ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.539" offset="2914116">Now, it is true that the respondent has come forward with some explanation of the background of that section of the statue.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.701" offset="2946717">But the fact remains that the existence of this section of the statue shows that the Congress was in a position and knew how to deal with issue discount under the 1939 Code, when it was faced with the need so to deal with issue discount under the 1939 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.379" offset="3025502">There were other examples as specific enactments dealing with issue discount that should have been superfluous, if the rule under the 1939 Code was as is contended.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.462" offset="3077747">There are special provisions in Section 207(d) and 207(e) dealing with certain insurance companies and specifically requiring those certain insurance companies to accrue and report is ordinary income discount and on the counter balance to accrue and report by way of reduction of ordinary income on premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.433" offset="3197701">Going back into the legislative history, we find specific statements in the Congress wherein they displayed their understanding and awareness of the fact that debt obligations were issued at a premium under the discount and that different -- were being issued with expressed interest under the discount and that different tax consequences attached to the different types of obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.311" offset="3337195">We have at some length delved upon the Senate debate in 1929.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.656" offset="3366557">This debate was occasioned by a proposal which authorized the issue of treasury bills at a discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.357" offset="3409398">At that time, interest on U.S. obligations was exempt from the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.158" offset="3436565">It was recognized that to make the treasury bills competitively saleable, there had to be some exemption factor attached to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.677" offset="3482645">The proposal of the treasury and accepted by the senate finance committee was to attach the exemption factor by providing in the statue that all gain on the sale or rather disposition of these bills should be exempt from tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.304" offset="3565192">The debate in the Senate shows that there was considerable opposition to such a proposal, because it was felt that there should not be any weakening of the structure which required all capital gains to be subject to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.746" offset="3626945">The debate in the senate further shows that the senate was fully aware of the fact that the discount at which these bills were being issued represented to use the words of Senator Reid ‚ÄúHire for the use of money‚Äù and further demonstrates that the Senate believes because it had been so advised by the treasury that under then existing regulations of the treasury, discount, issue discount when realized would be taxed as capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.605" offset="3754318">And accordingly, the exemption for interest which then existed pertaining to obligations of the United States could not apply to a treasury bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.546" offset="3806145">The Congress again displayed the great awareness of the situation by carving out the discount, by specifically legislating that the discount shall be labeled and classified as interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.064" offset="3872183">And in that way, the Congress permitted to be attached to the discount at which these bills were issued, the exemption then applying for interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.234" offset="3920875">In 1938, there was a subcommittee appointed as a part of the study leading to 1939 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.302" offset="3973120">This subcommittee considered whether or not to eliminate the capital gains tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.293" offset="4001123">Because time is running out, I cannot now read to you the excerpt from this committee's report, but I should like to refer You Honors to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.701" offset="4042710">It is on, page 15 of my brief, and clearly again shows that the Congress was aware of the practice and was aware of the different tax results that existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.236" offset="4108852">I have no place in the respondent's paper been able to find any statement by respondent, that his practice was other than during this period prior to 1953, 1952 and prior, other than to treat issue discount as capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.385" offset="4189518">We have in our papers, references to the acquiescence which stood through five major legislative overhauls in a case which held that issue discount when realized was capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.250" offset="4248973">At the very beginnings of 1952, there was a special ruling issued in publishing the tax services, which again repeated respondent's position that issue discount when realized was taxable as a capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.221" offset="4312816">Now, it's true that the statue was changed in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.214" offset="4336849">However, I invite the Court's attention to the structure of the statue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.943" offset="4359732">It is as clearly as prospective an application as any statue could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.542" offset="4398080">It applies only to obligations issued after December 31, 1954, and that although the statue itself was passed in August of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.075" offset="4452206">Furthermore, in one specific instance, in Section 1232, where they wanted to change the existing rules, they have yet another effective date of March 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.671" offset="4518661">In connection with the enactment of the 1954 Code, the House Ways and Means Committee clearly stated that this is a change in the law that under the prior law issue discount was taxed when realized as a capital item.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.096" offset="4612284">With regard -- I have mentioned the situation with regard to bond premium and there legislative history was the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.651" offset="4642586">The situation is to bond premium to bring up more in line with concepts of finance and economics was corrected in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.894" offset="4687517">The respondent's answer here apart from the argument to which I have referred is primarily that discount is deductible to the issuer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.814" offset="4735164">Now, I can't find that that is an answer to the problem because as regards premium, premium has always been an item of increase to the issuers income even at the time when it was not an item of decrease to the holder's income with regard to the obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.595" offset="4846341">In summary so far as this first point --</text>

            <text syncTime="1232.780" offset="4931082">That is correct sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.668" offset="4954593">Now, I have -- there are several -- there are two things about this first point that I'd like to repeat and reiterate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.741" offset="5006942">One is, I think the government should come forward and clearly state what it is, what its position with regard to issue discount prior to 1953 since we are here dealing with the year 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.585" offset="5062322">And further to explain why, the government did not approach Congress prior to 1954 to amend the statue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.897" offset="5099520">Is the government not now in the position where it is coming to this Court and presenting to the Court arguments and reasons that should have been more properly presented to the Congress and which were not presented to the Congress until 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.062" offset="5184157">The second point that's involved in this case is a matter of fundamental importance and the administration of the tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.266" offset="5237029">It involves the question of the extent to which taxpayers are privileged to rely on public pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service and are privileged to believe that if those pronouncements are changed or if the position set forth therein is changed, they will be changed on the basis that does not discriminate as between taxpayers or as among the taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.884" offset="5363461">The partnership here purchased the securities at a time when it fully believed, because of the preexisting government practice that had been announced in more than one place and particularly announced in the acquiescence in the Fulton's case, that issue of discount when realized would bring about capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.854" offset="5467324">The government withdrew the Caulkins acquiescence in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.088" offset="5504313">At the time when the Caulkins acquiescence was withdrawn, the government stated that it could not and there was no basis to distinguish the discount element present in any security from the discount element present in any other security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.365" offset="5585398">In addition, although the Caulkins acquiescence which was a -- well, let me say this about acquiescence, that all of the things that the treasury may say ‚Äúthe most significant on this side of the table is the acquiescence.‚Äù</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.074" offset="5644225">This is what the practitioner and the businessman go high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.112" offset="5668362">When the Caulkins acquiescence was withdrawn, the government withdrew it not only retroactively without warning, but withdrew it on a basis that discriminated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.942" offset="5751745">In that case if you will remember sir, the Automobile Clubs' exempt status was revoked in 1945 and carried back to 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.007" offset="5807961">The Automobile Club said that the Commissioner should not be permitted retroactively to change his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.540" offset="5838158">This Court held that the Commissioner is privileged to change his position to correct the mistake of law, but whether he has acted properly always depends on the circumstances of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.161" offset="5888627">And in the discussion of the circumstances of the case, if my memory serves me correctly, there are two aspects that are emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.698" offset="5922691">One is that the carry back to 1943 gave the Automobile Club no cause for complaint, because in 1943 it had already been placed on notice by a publicly issued general counsel's memorandum that clubs such as it would no longer be exempt from tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.554" offset="6002207">And most importantly, when the Internal Revenue Service changed its position, it was uniformly applied clear across the boards to every taxpayer similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.210" offset="6052780">In this case, we have a retroactive application without warning and we have a discriminatory application, because the withdrawal of the Caulkins acquiescence is not applied as against particular taxpayers who purchased a particular kind of security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.290" offset="6133133">Even though at the same time, the Internal Revenue Service admitted that there was no basis on which to distinguish one discount security from any other discount security.</text>

            <text syncTime="1558.876" offset="6235429">Despite the shortage of time available today, I'd like to begin by restating very briefly the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.706" offset="6262805">The partnership of which the petitioners were members, in 1952 purchased $43 million worth of short-term promissory notes, either directly from the obligor corporations or through brokers -- through dealers and agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.686" offset="6334694">These notes bore no stated rate of interest, but in each case, they were issued at discounts ranging from two and three-eights to three and three-quarters percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.846" offset="6375340">By the end of the tax year, the partnership had sold 20 of these 33 notes for an aggregate gain of $500,000, virtually all of it should be result of discounts at which the notes were originally issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.611" offset="6430407">The other 13 notes remained on hand unmatured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.866" offset="6447438">The Commissioner determined that the excess of the face amount of the notes over the amount money for which they were purchased represented interest, accruing over the life of each note, both those that were sold and those that were not sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.547" offset="6514103">And since the partnership was on the accrual basis, the interest accruing on each of the notes was required to be included within the partnership's taxable income for the year and therefore, in the taxpayers distributed shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.345" offset="6573349">The taxpayers concede that this treatment would have been entirely appropriate if the notes that had provided for interest in so many words.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.178" offset="6604696">But they say, that because the interest element -- because the compensation they received for the use of their money was not specifically labeled as such, but was simply added to the amount which the borrower agreed to pay on the maturity of the notes, that they are not required to accrue it and that they are entitled to treat it as capital gain upon the sale of the notes.</text>

          <turn speaker="frank_i_goodman" startTime="1750.269" stopTime="2003.279">
            <label>Mr. Frank I. Goodman</label>
            <text syncTime="1750.269" offset="7001025">Caulkins, that's the name of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.039" offset="7016072">We think that the petitioner's contention is wholly formalistic and that it becomes all the more extraordinary when one further fact is noted which was not adverted to by Mr. Brandes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.292" offset="7061107">The record shows that as each of these notes was purchased, it was immediately pledged as security for a bank loan in an amount exactly equal to the face amount of the note.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.374" offset="7109486">Now, that indicates I think fairly clearly that the partnership obtained the $43 million with which to purchase these notes by borrowing it from a bank specifically for the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.609" offset="7162358">In 1952, it paid interest on the money which it borrowed in the amount of $625,000 and claimed that amount as an ordinary deduction on its income tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.908" offset="7211572">At the same time, the profit which it realized on the notes which it sold amounted to only $495,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.977" offset="7243860">So the tax consequences aside the net effect of the borrowing and lending transactions was an economic loss of $130,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.734" offset="7282834">Now, the explanation for this seeming folly lies of course in the tax consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.336" offset="7305300">Assuming that the partners were in the 60% bracket which seems a reasonable assumption, the net effect of their obtaining ordinary interest -- ordinary deduction on the interest which they pay while obtaining capital gain on the interest which they received is to reduce their overall tax bill by $250,000, thus not only completely wiping out the economic loss which they incurred before taxes, but giving them a fairly handsome after-tax profit to boot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.870" offset="7447406">And indeed so long as the taxpayers are in the 40% bracket or higher, they stand to gain on this arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.098" offset="7476349">To us, this is merely another illustration of the fact that unless the tax law conforms to the economic realities of a transaction, gimmicks and devices will readily be found to exploit the artificiality and to obtain advantages which the Congress never dreamed of giving.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.273" offset="7553045">Our position could be illustrated by a simple analogy, a disarming analogy as Mr. Brandes has referred to it without saying in anyway why it isn't completely applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.382" offset="7601528">If A gives B -- A lends B a $100 in return for B's promise to repay the $100 a year later, plus $6 extra, this obligation can be worded in a number of different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.604" offset="7666416">The note could say a $100 plus 6% interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.126" offset="7680418">It could say a $100 plus 6%, a $100 plus $6 interest, or $100 plus $6 or as in the present case, the note could simply say a $106.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.336" offset="7729319">Now, every one of these forms of expression obviously means exactly the same thing and our basic position in this case is that the tax consequences of each of these transactions should be exactly the same whether the interest is specifically labeled as such and whether or not it is stated as a percentage of the amount borrowed or as an amount added to what the borrower agrees to repay on maturity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.530" offset="7834018">In each case, the $6 increment represents exactly the same thing economically and that is compensation paid by the borrower to the lender in exchange for the use of the lender's money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.927" offset="7891696">In short, interest as this Court has defined it in Deputy versus du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.412" offset="7925551">Now, in the case of the note with the stated interest of 6%, everyone agrees that an accrual basis taxpayer has to accrue the $6 increment ratably over the term of the note.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.049" offset="7972153">We say that precisely the same should be true in the case of the non-interest bearing note promising a $106 at maturity.</text>
