          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_g_segal" startTime="55.969" stopTime="281.066">
            <label>Mr. Bernard G. Segal</label>
            <text syncTime="55.969" offset="223817">Fine, but I will remember to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.841" offset="231340">Now, I will consider that.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.433" offset="241685">First, I should like to correct and this is one of my problems, the misapprehension created in the other argument yesterday, Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, that there is a simple expedient here that the government can just go to the tax court.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.456" offset="297796">Your Honors, will remember that, that was the answer you got form Mr. Begley when you asked the question, that simply isn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.233" offset="324859">In the first place, the government can never go to the tax court.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.616" offset="334367">The tax court is not available to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.037" offset="344085">In the second place, what would happen in the related situation, demonstrates the safeguard that Congress did place on fraud cases because what would happen is the taxpayer would got a 90-day letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.760" offset="391001">He would then come to the tax court and ask the tax court to stay the assessment.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.027" offset="420049">Then the government would have to raise the defense of fraud and the statute expressly says that, then the government has the burden of proving fraud and the rules say it must then set forth all the facts that constitute the fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.166" offset="484624">Then it must improve suspicion of fraud, it must then prove fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.489" offset="501864">So that as Your Honors can see that government even if allowed to go the tax court under those circumstances never would because it would have to show all the facts and would have a far greater burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.014" offset="540003">So that simply was on a say, with full deference an erroneous answer to the justices' question.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.655" offset="570619">Second I should like to point out, yesterday I said that it was not available to the government in this case, the argument on the affidavit's conclusory statement about over purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.048" offset="620147">Since that is not the issue presented for certiorari and it wasn't the issue argued in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.655" offset="646583">But there's a much more fundamental reason, I should like to refer Your Honors to that argument by the Court, because it really shows what the Courts -- what the Government's concept is of a fair hearing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.485" offset="697887">Because what it means is that the Court believes -- the government believes that all it has to do is file an affidavit, refuse to permit the witness to appear, and on that conclusory statement get relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.081" offset="764238">Now, Your Honors will remember that in Reisman, this Court held and the government contended the very opposite of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.538" offset="790152">It said, don't permit the government to be enjoined by the taxpayer because he has the right to a full adversary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.306" offset="821185">Now is that a hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="207.478" offset="829858">You file an affidavit with a conclusory statement, you refuse to produce the witness, isn't cross-examination the first fundamental of a fair hearing?</text>
            <text syncTime="216.202" offset="864758">So I say to Your Honors that while the substance isn't available, the argument really points out, the government's view point here that what the Court is a rubber stamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.338" offset="909270">That when the government comes to the Court for enforcement all the Court can do is say, "Here's an affidavit, you don't have to produce the witness, he doesn't have to be cross-examined."</text>
            <text syncTime="237.629" offset="950439">And now Mr. Justice Black to relieve your mind as to the length of the hearings, may I say that I have reviewed all of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.901" offset="983562">In only one case did the hearing exceed a day, because all that's involved is the suspicion of fraud and therefore all that has to be done is to put the agent on and in these cases what has happened is the agent says "Here are my grounds for suspecting fraud."</text>
            <text syncTime="264.643" offset="1058482">There is usually nothing the taxpayer can do except cross-examine him as to the honesty of whether he is giving answers that are true.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.389" offset="1085544">On one or two occasions, there was countervailing testimony, in only one case was a day-and-a-half consumed, usually a half day is consumed in all this cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.053" offset="1216157">The issue is whether the government has a reasonable basis for suspecting fraud, whether it can meet this burden relatively slight which is cast upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.571" offset="1270282">In the relatively few cases out of the 60 million taxpayers, where it wants to allege fraud, whether before it can place on the taxpayer the onus of a fraud examination, it comes into Court and says "Your Honor, we'd like our summons enforced and we'd like it enforced because we have a suspicion of fraud and the reason we suspect fraud is this” and all the cases have used that test for alternatively probable cause except Judge Browning who has used this rational judgment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard G. Segal</label>
            <text syncTime="381.105" offset="1524402">The real question Mr. Justice Goldberg is whether the government has any basis to go into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.625" offset="1546449">I say that a mere letter is not a basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.715" offset="1558779">If the government thinks it's a basis it looks at -- it looks at the kind of house the man lives in from the outside, it tries to get such superficial evidence as it can get, but it can't act and ask the Court to enforce summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.569" offset="1622204">It can issue a summons if it wants to, but if the taxpayer objects, then the Court must have a hearing and there's an obligation on what the government must show and this is what Congress intended to protect against.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.671" offset="1678629">This is why Congress put on the government the burden of proving fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.959" offset="1691794">This is why all these cases say you must show a suspicion of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.954" offset="1711752">It isn't automatic that the government ought to have the right to examine each citizen for fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.498" offset="1729933">It's automatic that it has the right to examine each citizen's return and we must remember that, Mr. Justice Goldberg how plenary is the authority of the government in the first three years and it uses this plenary authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.489" offset="1773923">Now to please the Court, as I left the Court yesterday and this is my last point, I thought what could be said to counter the force and the specific facts of the history that I related to Your Honors yesterday of the practices and the decisions under them, certainly, it can't be said that the statute is not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.316" offset="1861172">Certainly that they're not old.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.943" offset="1875696">Certainly it can't be said the treasury department has ever asked for an amendment or that Congress has made an amendment and I say it cannot be asserted that the Government has not used this very test and I just quote one case to Your Honors Martin against Chandis back in 1942 where the Court said, "It is appellants, that's government's, contention that the only showing required and we assume also that the only contention required is" and I quote the government's contention, “a showing of probable cause sometimes called reasonable ground for suspicion of fraud.”</text>
            <text syncTime="505.275" offset="2021042">That's right in the decision of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.635" offset="2030446">Therefore, the only possible confusion that might result this from language used in cases, and I discount the Second Circuit for the moment, where the holdings are contrary to some of the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.597" offset="2078302">In older cases where they talk about the Fourth Amendment where the taxpayer raises the defense of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.892" offset="2103484">In newer cases, few of them where they talk about Oklahoma Press and Morton Salt, which Your Honors will recall is a case -- are cases where there were challenges under -- constitutional challenges under Fourth and Fifth Amendment, where it was assumed that the statutory authority existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.942" offset="2175687">For example, in the first part of De Masters, and that's the only one I can say to Your Honor Judge Browning's case, there is language in which he rejects probable cause as a test citing Oklahoma Press and Morton Press.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.839" offset="2223334">But then what does he go on to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="557.961" offset="2231798">First, he shows the difference in the authority of the commissioner in the three years and thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.285" offset="2253113">Second, he goes on to show the -- that after the bar the burden had shifted.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.567" offset="2286237">Third, he just demonstrates the dichotomy of 7605 (b) showing that there are two distinct prohibitions, and the first, no one necessary investigation is mandatory is the word he uses and then he establishes his test.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.318" offset="2345169">That reminds me if Your Honors please, of Mr. Justice Jackson's favorite quotation from Byron and Julia saying, she never would consent, consented because eventually what he holds is and I quote him, "The decision to investigate a innate of that purpose, namely to ascertain whether a suspicion of fraud is present, was in fact reached as a matter of rational judgment based on the circumstances of particular case” which wipes out the language as it does in the other cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1843.575" offset="7374263">I think this case is an excellent example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.417" offset="7385652">Here, the Government didn't have to show fraud when this summon was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.695" offset="7402684">We could have shown 25% under statement of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.341" offset="7417313">Now, what's happened because of the delay from this litigation we can't assess for under statement of income.</text>

            <text syncTime="1862.452" offset="7449704">Now, Mr. Segal can say, "Yes we've got this heavier burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.140" offset="7464542">"We didn't have it originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.102" offset="7472379">Well, this is a marvelous opportunity for taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.480" offset="7481887">Before we can really get into an investigation we're blocked at the start with a full trial, it would amount to a miniature trial, an appeal ultimately in this Court and we haven't even gotten a chance to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.825" offset="7535282">Now, he says, well all we had to do is make some showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.030" offset="7548029">What's obvious that it wasn't just some showing that was required, because he says that an anonymous letter isn't enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.132" offset="7576451">In addition to that he says, "Well, Mr. Powell would have complied if there been some showing."</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.338" offset="7597349">Well that's a very curious statement, because in a different case involving one of Mr. Klein's enterprises which Mr. Segal cites in his brief, the government served a summons on Mr. Powell, he refused to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.232" offset="7652833">We went into the District Court, we produced the agent, we produced third party affidavits, we produced documentary evidence, he still didn't comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.482" offset="7685851">The District Court refused to enforce the summons, not on the ground we hadn't made a showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.293" offset="7709153">He said "We have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.094" offset="7712287">We had in negative all the other possible explanations of the conduct of Mr. Klein”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.558" offset="7738201">Now, these are the kinds of cases we're having and I don't think it takes any great stretch of imagination to see that this is a serious hardship from the Government which interferes with our investigations.</text>
