            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="0">Number 50, United States, Petitioner, versus Daniel Andrew Seeger.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.621" offset="106475">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="27.696" stopTime="405.195">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="27.696" offset="110759">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.255" offset="124970">Since the next three cases all involved provisions of the Selective Service Act relating to conscientious objectors, the Court approved in an arrangement between counsel that I should present the Government's opening argument in all three cases in one piece, and at then each of the opposing parties would have an opportunity to reply with respect to his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.811" offset="219220">The reason for this is that all three cases do raise basic questions concerning the constitutionality of the provisions, relating to conscientious objector, whereas two of them also present separate questions concerning the interpretation or application of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.136" offset="296542">I shall argue the Seeger case first and devote the great bulk of my time to it, because it does present the basic constitutional issue, which is the one with which we are the most concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.576" offset="350250">The Universal Military Training and Service Act provides as we all know, for drafting young men into the armed forces as needed for national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.484" offset="397897">Generally speaking, the obligation is universal, although the provisions for deferment of those who are engaged in vital occupations.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.213" offset="440842">Section 6 (j) of the Act provides for special treatment of a defined class imprecisely and I may say misleadingly known as conscientious objectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.056" offset="492147">Conscientious objectors as defined in Section 6 (j) are not exempt from National Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.815" offset="523180">They are subject either to service and noncombatant capacities or to other important National Service as determined by local draft boards under regulations issued by the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.393" offset="581486">Those who are not subject to combatant service are defined in Section 6 (j).</text>
            <text syncTime="154.049" offset="616176">The relevant portions of which are printed on page two of the Government's brief in the Seeger case, Number 50 in the fattest of the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.791" offset="659122">It provides for an exemption from combatant training and service of anyone who by reason of religious training and belief is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.097" offset="716382">And then it goes on to define what is meant by the belief part of religious training and belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.605" offset="742400">And it means, the statute says, an individual's belief, in relation to a Supreme Being, involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but does not include essentially political, sociological, or philosophically views or merely personal moral code.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.988" offset="823902">The affirmative part of definition could be read doubtless with emphasis upon Supreme Being so as to require something which perhaps I might best describe as a fundamentalist god.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.741" offset="882939">We adopt a more liberal interpretation, having in mind not only the diversity of religions in this country, but also the fact that such eminent theologians such as Professor Tillich and Dr. Robinson, the Anglican Bishop of Willich defined the -- construe the idea of the personal god and defined god in such terms as the ultimate ground or root of our being.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.371" offset="989414">As we read the statute, therefore, it does not require belief in any particular kind of god.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.153" offset="1016581">The emphasis, we think, is between the contrasts on the one hand between the human duties that arise on between men solely from their relation to their fellows.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.420" offset="1061616">And on the other hand, duties, as the statutes put it, superior to those arising from any human relation.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.374" offset="1093486">The essence we think is the dichotomy between transcendent or divine obligations and essentially political, sociological, or philosophically views, or a merely personal moral code.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.802" offset="1159105">It's plain that Seeger's beliefs, fall in the later half, the nonreligious half of this dichotomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.527" offset="1190034">The Court will read his own statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.350" offset="1205394">“To me, I think it is fair to emphasize four points about them that standout."</text>
            <text syncTime="308.212" offset="1232771">First, Seeger's objection to serving in the armed forces was we agree, sincere and conscientious.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.441" offset="1265685">He pairs to have reached his conclusions after study and reflection.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.539" offset="1286060">Second, Seeger plainly did not believe in a god or gods, however defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.936" offset="1311660">Now, in duties transcending the obligations that arise among men, simply the fact -- from the fact that we are in a human society together, he rejected as pure expedience -- I mean that's his words, actions taken through fear of God, and said that he had more respect for the nobler pagan spirit of antiquity, but for a belief in -- belief in and devotion to goodness, and for their own sake, and to a purely personal ethical code.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.426" offset="1433704">Third, I would say that Seeger's philosophy did contain a sense of obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.497" offset="1461917">He spoke rather movingly of the duty of a person to give his life meaning by relating constructively, I think he put it, to the human surroundings in which he lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.386" offset="1521476">Fourth and most important, Seeger's opposition to war is overwhelmingly political.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.424" offset="1553659">Political in the sense that it is directed to the kind of things that the Government must consider in determining of whether to require Universal Military Service in determining what is its policy toward defense would be and what its foreign policy would be.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="405.195" stopTime="416.464">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="405.195" offset="1620741">This -- on this point that you find yourself an issue with your adversary don't you, that even in this case, there's a claim that this objection is -- has a religious basis, isn't that correct?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="416.464" stopTime="473.681">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="416.464" offset="1665776">Well, apparently, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.574" offset="1670269">I think the part of the tumble with that, Mr. Justice Stewart, is in the word religion which has so many meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.304" offset="1701198">And if I may just finish the point I was making, I then going to direct myself I think to that direct point.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.607" offset="1726380">I was emphasizing that I would say it was political and philosophical, that's a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.440" offset="1753757">But I do emphasize that his concern as he put it, was with the welfare of humanity and the preservation of democratic values.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.243" offset="1788970">From that standpoint, he argued that the preparation for war was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.097" offset="1808300">The philoso -- the philosophy behind the arms race is that military preparedness will deter aggression.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.571" offset="1834214">By arming ourselves and we're not provoking others to arm, was not this process -- was it not this process that led to war in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.537" offset="1870054">Sooner or later resentment and anger will outstrip fear and war will break out.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.985" offset="1891892">And those are --</text>

            <text syncTime="487.274" offset="1949048">I would think that they're part of their argument if that was all there was to it politically.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.075" offset="1972245">I should try to emphasize here.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.509" offset="1981962">Indeed, the essence of my case is almost the proposition, Mr. Justice Goldberg that one starts at one end.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.312" offset="2009234">And it can describe things that are purely political.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.245" offset="2020937">And one can describe at the other end things that we would all agree were clearly religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.082" offset="2040268">And in between the two, there is this continuum.</text>

            <text syncTime="514.140" offset="2056464">I don't suppose you'd have any doubt what he could -- this is a First Amendment case on the Free Exercise Clause that this man was practicing a religion if he is conducting services --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="526.125" stopTime="667.531">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="526.125" offset="2104424">I would have -- I wouldn't argue that the Congress could do anything to affect this man's belief, to prevent, to interfere with any rituals, to prevent any proselytizing, anything that has to do with the holding of beliefs or the observance proselytizing of beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.625" offset="2178403">I say that this is a case dealing with secular canon.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.660" offset="2190629">Also again, and I do not want to get too far ahead of myself because this is a terrible tangle if I may put it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.602" offset="2226364">Again, I think that this is dilemma that to provide at all for the opportunity for men to follow their religion in this area, the definition of those who are exempt has to be couched in the terms of belief, the terms which we would of course much rather not have secular legislation deal, but that that is one of the dilemmas, that Congress was entitled to take into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.172" offset="2328660">Now, all I'm saying - seeking to emphasize here without -- I don't really mean to characterize Seeger's argument too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.205" offset="2364813">I'm trying to state what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.423" offset="2373590">And the point that I want to emphasize is that it is in terms primarily of the wisdom, of policy decisions, the wisdom of defense, the wisdom of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.756" offset="2423014">He argued in his statement the first two World Wars failed to make the world safe for democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.284" offset="2445061">And World War III is not likely to be more successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.678" offset="2462616">War, he said, was self-defeating.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.177" offset="2472647">Not only because of the slaughter of innocent people but because it inevitably resulted in the destruction of the democratic, social, and political values for which our society stood.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.665" offset="2518622">It is in terms of social, political, perhaps philosophical, and yes humanitarian objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.839" offset="2551327">Now so of our many things, Mr. Justice Goldberg, that are religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.582" offset="2566269">But I think that I would argue that what is -- that the center of religion at least, remember that we're dealing with shades of conduct, it hold has something more than those purely humanitarian arguments to it, something that belongs to the realm of the spirit, something other than reason, something reaching deeper than reason usually.</text>

          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="700.298" stopTime="974.887">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="700.298" offset="2801162">Well, it seems to me that with all respect, that that's quite an impossible interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.661" offset="2826553">The language in the statute came from Mr. Chief Justice Hughes' dissenting opinion in the Macintosh case, and both have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.765" offset="2875037">And there it seems to me that he was contrasting political and sociological, philosophical views in a much broader sense in the judgment as to the particular war.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.478" offset="2921848">Second, I think it has to be born in mind that this particular part of the definition, the later part of Section 6 (j) was to put in following some judicial interpretations in the Selective Service Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.860" offset="2983393">Now, when the Selective Service Act of 1940 was enacted going beyond the old conscientious objector section of the World War I statute, two kinds of arguments were presented to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.782" offset="3051102">The old exemption have been confined to what I may put in members of the peace churches.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.812" offset="3079210">One had to be a member of a sect that taught objection to war in any form.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.054" offset="3104183">There was trouble defining what was a sect.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.847" offset="3115363">The primary argument, however, I would say as I read the hearings before the Congress and they were very long hearings, was that it was felt that this was unfair to the people of known religions, where the religion did not teach opposition to war as part of its creed, but where that individual as part of his religion nevertheless, have felt the sincere opposition to war.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.914" offset="3223615">Then another line of argument that was presented was that anyone who was conscientiously opposed to war should be exempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.939" offset="3255693">And it seems quite clear that when Congress spoke of religious training and belief that it was attempting to take care of the first class and not the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.662" offset="3294563">But even if that should be wrong, the Ninth Circuit accepted that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.994" offset="3315879">The Government had always accepted that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.334" offset="3325283">The Second Circuit apparently had departed from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.331" offset="3337300">Even if that should be wrong, Congress clearly put this language in the statute for the purpose of rejecting the Second Circuit's view and accepting the Ninth Circuit's view.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.904" offset="3379513">So there's a matter of interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.279" offset="3389022">I really think this means political in a broad sense as it's shown, I submit to you, by the -- by the context that associates political with philosophical, political philosophy.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.365" offset="3433430">It associates it with socio -- sociological, which surely is not directed simply at a single war.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.218" offset="3460807">Or a personal moral code of which again could hardly be directed in that direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.621" offset="3494452">If I were to try to sum up Seeger's views in the sentence, I would say that he felt a strong conscientious obligation to act and live by his political opinions, even to the point of resistance to the duly constituted civil authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.888" offset="3579507">Now, I do come to the point that was raised about the use of the term religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.189" offset="3600718">It seems to me that some confusion arises, Mr. Justice Stewart, from the fact that religion -- religious is being used here in a lot of different senses.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.219" offset="3644813">I think the facts may be fairly stated in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.648" offset="3666547">It was stipulated at the trial that some theologians whom Seeger might call as witnesses would testify that his views were religious within the meaning of the definition in the old Second Circuit Kauten case that was rejected by the amendment of the Section 6 (j).</text>
            <text syncTime="935.058" offset="3740212">And of course, we stand by that stipulation that some theologians would have so testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.024" offset="3764036">And I think it's fair to say that as a matter of usage, there are people who use the word religious in a way that encompasses Seeger's views.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.283" offset="3801130">Second, whether Seeger's views are religious in the sense in which the word is used in the constitution is a matter of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.024" offset="3840000">Well, that depends of course, not only on how you characterized Seeger's views but on how one interprets the term religion or free exercise thereof in the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1000.047" offset="4000183">And I would try to keep the sense in which I used the term religious clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.183" offset="4024633">I shall try to use it always unless the context shows otherwise in the sense in which it shows in the statute, and not in some of the other sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.751" offset="4062981">Now, in saying that Seeger's views are not religious, I don't mean to denigrate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.573" offset="4094224">We're in an intensely difficult area here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.589" offset="4110315">It's intensely difficult for the civil authorities to require any men, which he conscientiously feels that he should not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.395" offset="4149499">But this is a problem after all, as Congress faces it and as the draft authorities face it, that deal with awful choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.018" offset="4188056">We're talking about the life and death perhaps of an entire nation, of an entire civilization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.046" offset="4224104">And I think what Congress has essentially tried to say in Section 6 (f), and what we say it has the right to say is it when one is in that kind of area making these awful choices, then Congress has the right to say, “So long as your argument is that we are going about preserving democratic values, western civilization, and the ideals of American life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.627" offset="4350433">So long as your argument is in those terms, then the community has the right to set its judgment after consideration ahead of yours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.619" offset="4390452">Unhappy as it may be that someone must be forced to act in a way that his reason tells him he shouldn't act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.712" offset="4418769">But if the argument, that the objector made, is transported to another realm, if it's in a -- I would use the adjective “higher realm”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.725" offset="4466834">But if it's in a different realm, if it's in the realm of faith, of the spirit, of the divine, transcendent, then the Congress says, “We can't argue with you and we recognized your scoop.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.556" offset="4522214">And our argument simply is that Congress has the right to recognize that division, shady as the lines may often be, and that Congress has the right to make a choice that draws a line provided that it addresses itself, solely to drawing the line in terms of seeking to promote religious freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.201" offset="4624718">Now, I want to say a word if I may, about the question presented here, because it's intensely important that we be clear as to just what the question in this case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.837" offset="4683337">Since Seeger does not fall within the exemption, granted by Section 6 (j), he as far as to argue that it is unconstitutional to draft him for combatant service while exempting those who are opposed to war because of what are religious reasons within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.582" offset="4762227">The argument I take it is that he is the victim of an unconstitutional discrimination that can be avoided so long as those who are within the Section 6 (j) are exempted, only by exempting him also.</text>

            <text syncTime="1531.672" offset="6126655">Another way putting it which I try to suggest was the kinds of considerations that the Government debates so that the executive and legislative branches suffer over when they have to make these decisions about defense or war and peace, and the kind of question that belongs in a different realm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.344" offset="6233339">Now, those it seems to me are poles apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.501" offset="6265940">And that the heart of the problem here results from the fact that they are poles apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.830" offset="6295301">The way I plan to approach the constitutional issue, the substance of it, and the way I find that gets most quickly into the heart of it is by looking at this problem of what to do about conscientious objector loosely speaking, as it faces the Congress or a legislator because that forces you, thinking about the Constitution as well as what ought to be done but looking at it prospectively rather in -- than in arrears, because that forces you to really face up to the hard questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.849" offset="6427376">But other course that Congress might have followed would be less subject to the objections made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.206" offset="6460813">What is it about this statute in terms of what could be done that is unconstitutional?</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.781" offset="6487040">Now, I started looking at it that way with three things that seem to me to be facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.629" offset="6514416">One is that the American people from long before we became an independent nation has believed that there are some men usually members of the peace churches, who should not be ordered to fight of because this would require them to disobey what they believe to be the revealed commands of their god, of the doctrines, or perhaps being the epitome of that class of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.850" offset="6647327">And we have always felt that some such allowance should be made of -- that a man who took that position, if he didn't fight as he wouldn't, should not be put in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.015" offset="6699990">Second, it seems to me there's also a fact that in the absence of conscription, men would have all kinds of reasons why they should not go into the army or perhaps the farthest over on the -- toward to pull away from the dunkard that we need to go is the man who reason on simply practical terms that defense and war are always self-defeating, in practical terms, that the damage to human welfare, of the wealth, on the opportunities that are lost in war never can be equaled by the games from war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.898" offset="6863517">Therefore as a purely material political man, one should never fight any war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.320" offset="6889221">The third, I suggest as I have before us, argued by the petitioner, that between those two, there is what I've called the continuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.640" offset="6926524">That one shades into the other or that the views in between have indifferent degrees, different elements and different combinations of each element of belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.744" offset="6982949">And that you really can't tell where one divides into the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.717" offset="7006772">Now, given those facts, it seems to me that three conclusions inescapably follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.843" offset="7039269">First, that although a sec -- Selective Service Act that deals with secular conduct, there is no escape for framing any classification and easing the plight of any conscientious objector in terms of opinion or belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.776" offset="7115024">You just can't appoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.153" offset="7124532">Congress might exempt no one and override all objections including the deepest religious objections and those based most clearly on revealed command.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.915" offset="7175628">It might exempt to everyone who have some reason that he personally thought he didn't want to or shouldn't serve in the armed forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.160" offset="7212617">Congress can go a good way to eliminate the differences as indeed it has done because it requires everyone to give some national service and for -- and during war has taken everyone out of his home in civilian intern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.727" offset="7282834">But under any course, it takes any account of religious objectives to war.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.458" offset="7309793">It must frame the exemption in terms of a man's opinion or beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.281" offset="7341035">And I suppose that raises the initial constitutional question, does the First Amendment prohibit Congress from classifying men for military service on the basis of their belief, religious, or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.658" offset="7406550">We think the answer is plainly that the Congress may provide for such classification, where necessary to accommodate the demands of religious liberty, to the needs of national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.313" offset="7461198">It seems to us that the contrary argument based as they are in the briefs on the quotations from prior opinions to the effect that Congress may not differentiate between religion and nonreligion, or may not differentiate between religions, all are too broad and too undifferentiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.170" offset="7544581">They failed to note the very different context which Mr. Justice Douglas has suggested already, in which those words are uttered and the differences between that case and this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.953" offset="7591811">Now, in our reply brief, we have set out three categories and I simply want to refer to them very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.926" offset="7627651">First, where legislation or other governmental action challenged under the First Amendment, attempts to punish or regulate beliefs or ritual or the professional beliefs, then of course the widest possible scope is given to the protection and the widest possible scope may be given to the word religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.044" offset="7720124">Here, the aim after all, is to guarantee people freedom of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.150" offset="7744575">To guarantee each man his own cosmology, his own philosophy in life, his own right to profess, his own right to proselytize, his right to do those things about what might say the subject's doubt within religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.517" offset="7809985">It doesn't matter whether his belief is religious or nonreligious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.686" offset="7830674">Indeed it's been suggested and I think the very sound basis that since the First Amendment protects other forms of opinion is really no need when you're dealing with this area of belief as such for proselytization, or profession the area dealt within Barnette, the area dealt within Torcaso, then there is no occasion really to distinguish between what's religion and what are some other form of belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.912" offset="7951569">Now, it rests I submit even within exemption for conscientious objectors falls in a quite different area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.536" offset="7986051">It's secular legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.718" offset="7994828">It deals with secular conduct resulting from beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.677" offset="8014681">Secular conduct of course may conflict with religious liberty, either because it requires conduct inconsistent with the teachings of religion, as was true in Sherbert v. Verner, or in the Prince case, or the old Jakobson case on vaccination, or because government regulation in conjunction with the observance of one's religious beliefs, the soothing conduct of the belief results in some kind of economic loss that is in Braunfeld and Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.964" offset="8143830">But the Court has always recognized a difference between legislation that attempts to intrude into the field of beliefs as such, or professions, or proselytization and legislation that regu -- that deals with the secular conduct resulting from beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.603" offset="8222407">And while Congress is absconded to its power in the latter area, it's not at all uninhibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.746" offset="8254903">It's perfectly clear that it is a great deal broader than it is in the areas like those in Torcaso and Barnette.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.254" offset="8288967">Now the second category of cases of course, the Court at bar in the second category perhaps in many other, deals with support of religion or involvement of the Government in religion in one form or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.612" offset="8358348">I questioned, as we have in our reply brief, whether the field that from which the Government is excluded here, is as broad as it is where you're dealing with the problem like Torcaso or Barnette.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.370" offset="8421460">There are many things that are called by some people to be religious, which I can't believe the Government may not aid or support or be involved in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.975" offset="8463882">For example it is said that ethics is religion, but surely one of the functions of our schools is to convey from one generation to the next some of the basic ethical principles of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.897" offset="8535562">This case, however, whatever may be the merit of that suggestion, this case does not involve, in any meaningful sense, support for religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.229" offset="8580911">To say that the Constitution requires Congress to ignore religious beliefs in imposing secular duties that conflict so directly with the teachings of religion as an order to engage in combat, in violation of what the man, the individual believes is the command of his -- the literal command of his God not to kill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.809" offset="8679236">It goes way beyond any meaning that's ever been put on the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.950" offset="8703791">And to give such an exemption, I suggest, is not in any sense to aid religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.630" offset="8734511">The Act deals here, this Act, deals with the beliefs of man as facts neither encouraging them nor discouraging them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.718" offset="8770769">Indeed I think it's fair to say that just as Congress concluded, that it was inhuman, harsh to require a son, all of whose brothers had been killed in the service to be drafted, was so cruel to his family, so here there was a similar feeling that given a man who would be put in jail for disobeying the command of his God was a lack of humanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.576" offset="8890201">It should have showed you compassionate exemption and one to of course aim at promoting the free exercise of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.044" offset="8924160">I think the contrary argument makes much to light of religious faith, alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.502" offset="8953940">It asserts that the people of conscientious objector are going to take on or give up their beliefs because of the differences it perhaps stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.671" offset="8998661">In the first place, I don't think anyone simply by his assignment to one form of national service or another is likely to be influenced at his beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.958" offset="9035755">In the second place, the Act makes it very clear through the test of sincerity that anyone who takes on a -- what he calls a religious belief or from that motivation of course would be given a 1-A and not a 1-O classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.009" offset="9103987">Now, I do acknowledge, of course, that there is some difference in treatment between anyone exempted from combatant service or at one drafted through combatant service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.762" offset="9154978">And I suppose there are those who would regard one as in advantage over the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.647" offset="9182563">If there were any way of avoiding that difference of treatment, it would seem quite possible that the First Amendment would require Congress to avoid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.032" offset="9228121">But here we come up to what I think is the second of the hard realities of this case of the insoluble, inescapable dilemmas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.782" offset="9283082">And that is that you cannot treat the one who is exempted and you cannot treat the religious objector like the man who has no religious objections and still provide for the free exercise of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.671" offset="9350583">There just isn't any way it could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.456" offset="9361763">Either you're going ahead classifying differently because of his faith and his desire to pursue these conducts to his faith, or you're going to ignore this faith.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="2375.236" offset="9500944">Well, I think I really hadn't quite come to that point, Mr. Justice Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.569" offset="9522260">I shall indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.300" offset="9529156">The point I was trying to make here was simple that if one is going to provide for the free exercise of religion, he must treat the religious objector somewhat differently from the general run of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.695" offset="9598746">I did not mean to suggest that he must draw the line between religious objectors and nonreligious objectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.861" offset="9639393">I did mean to suggest that he must draw the line in terms of belief and I intend to dwell on that a little bit further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.477" offset="9673874">But my point now is that simply to the extent that there is in this classification, anything that can be called aid, advantage, benefit, I don't think it can fairly be called support but anything of that kind for religion or for conscience if it was driven and drafted in those terms, that it's inescapable, that there is no way of not making some difference according to beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.270" offset="9792993">Now this -- this is very important in terms of answering the arguments, that you can't treat religion differently from nonreligion as it is important in treating, entering the argument you can't treat two religions differently, because it's inescapable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.694" offset="9854746">If you're going to do anything for the free exercise of religion here, that there will be some differentiation between people according to their beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.990" offset="9891944">Now, that much differentiation, we think Congress has done everything possible to reduce it, that much differentiation, we think, is permitted or justified even though not required by the problem of accommodating the Free Exercise Clause with the other requirements of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.144" offset="9992568">And on this point, it seems to be that the precedent shows very clearly that we are right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.847" offset="10019318">Those most closely in point of course are the decisions beginning with the Selective Draft cases in 245 U.S. where the Court sustained a narrower exemption than the present one both against the argument that it improperly favored religion as against nonreligion, and against the argument that it improperly favored are the peace churches or members of the peace churches against those whose individual religious belief was opposed to war in any form but who's created -- but whose church did not adhere to such faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.839" offset="10175321">Those cases have been cited with approval in a number of recent opinions in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.149" offset="10208549">We've gathered them and quoted from them at some length in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.095" offset="10236343">They include the opinion by Mr. Justice Brennan, in the Sunday Blue Laws cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.045" offset="10264137">Also the opinion I think, or the opinions I think of Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Sunday Blue Laws cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.207" offset="10300813">Again in the -- in the Schempp case, the opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan and the opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Goldberg suggest very strongly that Congress may grant exemptions from secular legislation where necessary to accommodate the requirements of the secular legislation to the free exercise of religious belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.848" offset="10427350">Sherbert and Verner certainly would seem to support that proposition indeed it seems to hold that under some circumstances that may be a requirement, a constitutional requirement and not just something permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.306" offset="10485133">And the dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice White, clearly recognizes although they held that it was not a constitutional requirement, that there is some leeway for accommodation by the legislature or the Congress in working out this kind of the accommodation of between the demands of religious freedom and in this case the needs of national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.894" offset="10611566">Now, I come to a point I've already alluded to several times but I like to deal with it more precisely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.065" offset="10644167">The third inescapable fact, if one asks, what can Congress do in this area?</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.762" offset="10678962">The third inescapable fact that confronts anyone facing that question, I'm seeking to allow for the free exercise of religion in relation to military conscription is that wherever the line is drawn, the any exemption or classification will have to involve inescapably fine shadings of belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.487" offset="10777913">And really the question here I think when you come down to it, is whether the First Amendment leaves some room for Congress to decide where the line should be drawn between the fine shadings of belief, or whether the Court or because the Constitution requires it is going to hold that it must draw that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.226" offset="10868820">Now, the polar cases as I've said before are relatively easy to deal with but no one has any trouble distinguishing between that about 18th Century Quaker, or the Mennonite, the Dunkard and others on the one hand, and those who object to military conscription on the ground that building up the national defense will lead to further building up and mobilization on the other side that eventually this will lead to war and that all war is defeating in humanistic terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.815" offset="11035167">The problem is that these two merged into each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.340" offset="11065260">Now, where is the line between religion, conscience and disinterested political or economic judgment?</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.303" offset="11109146">Is the test one of the stubbornness of belief of its source, of its ultimate justification?</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.736" offset="11142896">Where do political and economic policy break off and philosophy begin?</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.241" offset="11168914">And where does philosophy break off and religion begins?</text>

            <text syncTime="2819.250" offset="11276957">I think the great fallacy in the opinion of the court below, and in the arguments of counsel here, is the failure to recognize that wherever the line is drawn, there will be cases on opposite sides of it, which differ only in degree at which other persons might put in a different category because they give somewhat different scope to the terms ethics, philosophy, political or religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.905" offset="11407569">I think that in this area the very simple and attractive, I must acknowledge proposition, that the First and Fifth Amendments prohibit any differentiation between forms of religion, is itself too undifferentiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.164" offset="11472562">It's supposed too broad and too narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.638" offset="11482488">It's much too narrow as applied to the area that Mr. Justice Douglas referred to as the First Amendment question where you're really regulating a belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.933" offset="11519687">It's much too narrow when you're dealing with support for religion in the sense of Engel or Schempp with that problem regardless of the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.560" offset="11562214">But it's much too simple, too broad when you come to this problem of classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.082" offset="11608294">It really is a gross I submit with reference to the court below and the counsel, a gross over simplification to pretend that the line between what is religion and what is not religion, it vows no shadings of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.753" offset="11674958">And to pretend that there are no relevant differences in terms of this problem between what might be termed by some definitions to be religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.735" offset="11714873">And then I would go on as we have in our brief, to raise the question whether it helps very much to approach the problem in terms of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.692" offset="11758759">You will find in some of the briefs amicus a great many different definitions of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.556" offset="11778194">The psychologists, sociologists have a definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.708" offset="11794808">The fundamentalists, the 18th Century -- 19th Century church had very different definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.943" offset="11827722">And some theologians have moved towards the definition of the psychologists, others have remained fundamentalists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.941" offset="11859696">It would seem to me that for the Court to choose, as Mr. Justice Stewart suggests, between one of those definitions of religion and to say that that is the constitutional religion was far more an interference with what's really important in the First Amendment but for the Court to say, that the Congress may make a careful, non-invidious classification, closely related to permissible aims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.043" offset="11988114">Now, of course it's suggesting the Congressmen make a classification of resulting from differences in belief I hasten to add that it must be very closely scrutinized so that there will not be the kind of difference that Mr. Justice Douglas mentioned before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.066" offset="12056242">So there will be no suggestion why we like Catholic and we don't like Buddhist or Catholics have so many hundred thousand votes and the very few Buddhists are sent to Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.302" offset="12105143">That kind of difference of course violates the standards of due process established by the Fifth Amendment especially when it's read in conjunction with the First.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.849" offset="12151327">Our argument, I hope and certainly is not intended to contain any suggestion that there's to be a difference based upon on some kind of an invidious classification, or based upon judgments concerning the orthodox, the truth of what a man beliefs, not truth of whether he believes it but the abstract truth of what he believes, or based upon some notion of the word with different views.</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.493" offset="12629891">Second, remember as the case comes here, the question as what to draft board might have concluded about his beliefs, and not how we would interpret because he doesn't have to take everything exactly at face value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.660" offset="12706586">Third what I'm arguing, I could see that as a better usage many people would denominate his beliefs religion but nor as I said earlier I'm not quite sincere about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.866" offset="12747442">I don't mean to denigrate his conscience or his beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.961" offset="12763742">He's -- depressed by and he's quite a fellow unhappily, providing for the national defense can be inconsistent with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.881" offset="12803448">But I don't think what I am suggesting is whether somebody would call this religious or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.800" offset="12831138">In some sense of the term, isn't decisive, that if the question that Congress had the power to say as I have tried to argue, that this involves drawing a line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.746" offset="12878890">This question involves shadings from one view into another of what are easy to separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.982" offset="12919850">And that if Congress draws the line for secular purposes, and solely either in terms of secular differences, or for the purpose, Mr. Justice, of attempting to separate out what is religious as we would all agree by any definition, from what is political or philosophical or sociological as we would all agree from any definition, by any definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.402" offset="13061538">But if it is addressing itself to that and that if the line it draws can be justified in terms of that objective, then it doesn't introduce a lot of other invidious things, then we say that it is not prohibited even by the First or Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3422.672" offset="13690671">It's a line that has to do with people's state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.143" offset="13704568">You would simply move it farther out away from what we would all call religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.596" offset="13726302">But it still remains a line based on something subjective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.486" offset="13745842">Second, I think that it goes beyond anything that can be fairly called the free exercise of religion, that religion does mean something other than conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.263" offset="13801012">The illustrations that occurred to be is it clearly would be against if I don't mean to be rude, but clearly be against the conscience of any justice of this Court to let the substance of a decision be known before the opinion day on Monday, to friends or to induce paper reporter or to anybody else.</text>

            <text syncTime="3489.062" offset="13956180">All I am again saying is that these things do tend to run together, as it is inescapable that someone draws a line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.167" offset="14004663">But I think that at one end of conscience, that one end of religion, they are virtually separate as day and night.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.038" offset="14048131">I think we all know men, there are many things they wouldn't do because of conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.529" offset="14070073">But who of themselves would say, that they attributed no religious significance to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.041" offset="14096091">Now, I don't -- I think Congress could have drawn the line clearly the other way, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.407" offset="14117616">It might be that if arrive where the Congress we would draw the line and where the British drew the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.133" offset="14140500">I don't say this is the only line that could be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.389" offset="14153456">I say that this is a constitutional line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.114" offset="14168398">I say that it is a reasonable workable line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.253" offset="14188983">The arguments that we make as part of that proposition are developed at some lengths in our belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.960" offset="14223778">I spent so much time trying to show that one is free to take them into account that there really isn't time to develop them here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.609" offset="14258364">But you'll recall first there the argument of history shows that this is a reasonable line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.879" offset="14283442">That this is a line between religion and conscience, if I may use those terms as been one of various forms of conscription have made throughout our history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.853" offset="14323357">Occasionally, you find conscience used in early statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.447" offset="14341747">I strongly suspect that it meant religious conscience but I have nothing to show one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.825" offset="14367242">But the line nearly always has been in terms of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.146" offset="14380513">I suggest second, that this has over the years through two world wars, through Korean period, and the intensely difficult period of a drastic peace talks approved a pretty workable line both in the sense that it's been administrable, and in the sense that both those drafted and their families that all seem to have found it pretty acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.138" offset="14484480">We say for a third thing that this line does take care of what seems to be at the pole of what is clearly religion and to be drawn in terms that has applied to one like Seeger, do tend to differentiate some place of penumbra whether you call it religion of nonreligion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.893" offset="14591478">And finally I think it is significant, we've argued this at more length in our brief, that the definition of religion in the statute conforms very closely to what has been our national sense of what is religion down through history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.090" offset="14672353">The Court has often said that we are a religious people whose institutions presupposed a divine being.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.829" offset="14699311">I take that it means divine being only in the -- somewhat in the sense certainly today that I have used it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.985" offset="14727837">I don't mean to suggest that if the legislation was trespassing in the people's belief or profession, or that if it had to do with some part for religion that in a national conscientious would justify that of course, nor indeed do I suggest that this is the only justification here because this would come to a difference that it might exclude Buddhists and some other strange sect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.388" offset="14837551">What I do say is that along with the other considerations, that it is relevant to take into account that the law that touches so many people, so many millions of people so imminently, closely and so fearsomely at many times in our history that the national understanding of what constitutes religion would certainly affect Congress could take into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.387" offset="14949460">Now, I plan to go on, Mr. Chief Justice if I may to the second of these cases, the Peter's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.999" offset="14999928">The constitutional arguments that I have made, apply equally to the Peter's case which I shall argue next, and to the Jakobson case, the third of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.602" offset="15062309">I have no intention of repeating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.801" offset="15075161">I shall devote my self now simply to the separate issue in each of these other two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.944" offset="15107762">Peter first registered with this local -- I should have said one thing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.245" offset="15132944">Peter claims that he falls within the definition of the exemption in Section 6 (j), that is his opposition to war, is based upon belief in a Supreme Being involving duties superior to the duties that arise out of human relationships and it's that point that I'm going to address myself to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.611" offset="15242344">Peter first registered with this local draft board while a student at Reed College.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.380" offset="15265437">He did not claim at that time to be a kind of conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.861" offset="15283409">But a year later, when he filled out a standard questionnaire form the draft board, he submitted a poem expressing opposition to war even then he didn't claim classification as a conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.095" offset="15352372">In February 1958, he voluntarily withdrew as a student at Reed College.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.094" offset="15380376">And within a bearing of few days or few weeks if not few days thereafter since he had lost or having lost his student deferment, he requested forms that he might express his conscientious objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.062" offset="15444219">The draft board denied the classification and after a hearing, it reaffirmed his denial of the 1-A classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.105" offset="15492389">Peter appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.279" offset="15501061">There was the usual FBI investigation, a hearing that he and two witnesses attended before a hearing officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.904" offset="15535543">A report recommendation by the Department of Justice and ultimately his draft board voted again to deny conscientious objector status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.852" offset="15587370">Out of those materials, they've emerge a sketch of Peter's life and belief, that I want to summarize very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.566" offset="15626240">Peter's family had no religious affiliation and he was not brought up in a religious background.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.415" offset="15653616">As a high school student he had been introspective and exceedingly independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.118" offset="15676395">And some of his teachers testified that if he ever reached the conclusion, that it was morally wrong to kill there would be no doubt about having the perseverance to be a conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.429" offset="15729685">He then went to Reed College, where he left a reputation for good moral character but deficient scholarship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.934" offset="15767719">He's never been very good student apparently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.741" offset="15782870">He withdrew from Reed as I have said in February 1958, and immediately thereafter, having then lost the deferment as a student, requested classification as a conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.882" offset="15847445">After leaving college, he lived -- rather bohemian existence apparently in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.492" offset="15877956">Most of it in the cust -- in the company of (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.956" offset="15899794">He was interested, I would guess in a rather unsophisticated untutored way in music, art, and poetry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.668" offset="15938664">He worked for Bree Spells (ph) once as a hall man, once as a photographer's assistant, once as a temporary clerk at post office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.780" offset="15987043">For one reason or another, he didn't keep any job very long.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.346" offset="16005329">His post office job, he left with the expedition that the job involved driving truck as indeed as a substitute, and that he would not drive a truck as he said as a matter of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.764" offset="16063007">He explained his views about military service, war and religion at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.837" offset="16095295">But I think they could be epitomized and fairly epitomized by a short passage in a letter that he wrote to the Director of the Selective Service System when he asked him to take an appeal to the president for the classification of the Appeal Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.584" offset="16166243">In that letter he explained his opposition to military institutions, saying the presence of other living beings in the universe, sounds a call, presents a vision, a fact, a mysterious reality that I cannot deny and to which I feel the impulse to relate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.480" offset="16245864">I view physical violence on the other hand as a denial of life, and I really think that it is fair to say that that is the essence although he used great many more words of his objection to military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.951" offset="16319739">The hearing officer and the Department of Justice recommended denial of the claim to exemption, the Appeal Board by a vote of five to nothing did deny it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.763" offset="16362998">When Peter was called for induction, he refused to submit and this prosecution followed into the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.144" offset="16396539">Now District Court entered a judgment of conviction and the Court of Appeals affirm because it found that Peter's belief, involved no sense to responsibility to an authority higher and beyond at a worldly one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.158" offset="16460591">I would emphasize that under the settled course of decision here, the only question is whether the Local Selective Service Board and the Appeal Board, had any basis whatever for concluding that Peter is not conscientiously opposed to war by reason of religious training and belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.046" offset="16544183">And that belief, as I said in the previous case, must involve duties associated with some relation, to something that can be called a Divine Being.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.687" offset="16586710">Call it God, a person, an ideal, an abstraction, that involves duty superior to those arising from the human relation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.268" offset="16629029">To prevail in other words, Peter must show that the record is devoid of anything, that which support for conclusion that he had such a belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.504" offset="16665913">I make a good deal of this point because it seems to me, that the essence of the Selective Service System is that this question perhaps especially this question, of where the ones entitled to deferment is a conscientious objector, should be resolved by the people who could see and hear the registrant -- the registrant, concise him up and do the community what sort of people who are in it as possible, and thus form a judgment but which necessarily would involve some application of the term to the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.440" offset="16825678">The elements that convince me, that there was such a basis in this record, it convince me that Peter's objections could be found not to be based on religious training and belief, are a little different from those emphasized in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.930" offset="16891716">I think our brief treats it a little too conceptually and abstractly I should say my brief, because I'm not blaming anyone else, I wrote it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.944" offset="16927765">But I do think the essential elements can be stated rather frequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.520" offset="16950021">First, Peter did not come for the religious background and had no religious training.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.737" offset="16974890">Second, his original claim to conscien -- to classification as a conscientious objector whether he made did not assert that his objection was based on any religious training or belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4257.512" offset="17029956">Third, he belong to no religious sect, he did not worship, he had no form of creed, he had no body apparently of moral or ethical principles, no thought out body, I don't mean anything other than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.129" offset="17092441">All of his life, he'd been independent to the fight of being a rebel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.479" offset="17113861">And I don't say that to criticize him at the slightest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.016" offset="17127967">I say it simply to indicate that he would be -- he was a personality who would be capable of challenging the Government's drafting in but without the sustenance that comes from religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.362" offset="17177391">And this seems to me to be a significant point in deciding the nature of his objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.714" offset="17198811">But most important, Peter's life and his statements of his belief convey no sense of ethical obligation, no moral code except concern for life, no belief in duty or belief in a sense of obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.143" offset="17276552">In this respect, it seems to me that Peter's case compares rather unfavorably with Seeger's because Seeger did if you will recall speak quite movingly of the moral responsibility to make one's life worthwhile and of his admiration for what he described as the pagan stoics.</text>
            <text syncTime="4341.256" offset="17364950">But there seem here perhaps I don't understand Peter, but I do submit to the Court that there is a basis in the record, from which the draft board could fairly draw the conclusion, that Peter had no sense of religious obligation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4571.051" offset="18284147">No, but I really don't think that -- excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4573.712" offset="18294805">I didn't mean to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4575.641" offset="18302537">What I meant to say was that in terms of having a body of ethical or moral beliefs, a sense of obligation that Peter compared unfavorably to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="4588.521" offset="18354051">There is not that slight question I have fully agreed with, that to the extent that religion involves mystical quality and I think that it is in its purest form that clearly does, that Peter had a strong mystical quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4606.492" offset="18425940">I would emphasize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.575" offset="18430224">I think with Peter's case reading it most favorably to the -- it should be read it other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.684" offset="18458645">But reading in most favorably to the draft board, I think Peter's case comes down to this, his claim to religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.675" offset="18482678">That he believes in life as I say believes in existence, that he feels a mystical sense of oneness with living things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.177" offset="18516637">That he says that war is death and destruction, and therefore he will not participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.280" offset="18541087">It's fair to add that for the same reason he wouldn't drive a truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.424" offset="18557597">He does have a very genuine, I'm not trying -- I'm trying to describe it not to make fun at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.356" offset="18581420">He does have a genuine feeling for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="4649.111" offset="18596362">And what our case really comes down to, this case doesn't have anything to do with the deism, or what you mean by God.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.827" offset="18635233">Our case is simple, that a deeply mystical sense of the importance of life and the feeling of oneness in the world with the processes of creation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4671.415" offset="18685597">But devoid of all other aspects of religion does not, we submit, meet the definition of religion in Section 6 (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.722" offset="18730841">It seems to me that -- there are many illustrations one can think of it that kind of feeling about life.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.807" offset="18775144">If I put it in personal terms, it took a long time for me to bring myself to slaughter a chicken.</text>
            <text syncTime="4700.990" offset="18803879">I've never understood how a man could drown kittens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.458" offset="18825822">I went hunting -- went along with a man once hunting, and while climbing on the mountain, you have to feel a good beauty, joy, excitement, once he shot and got the elk, everything was death and ashes, I wouldn't go hunting again.</text>
            <text syncTime="4724.452" offset="18897711">But I don't think that kind of feeling standing alone meets the kind of definition of religion,in terms of involving higher duties in those among men.</text>
            <text syncTime="4739.638" offset="18958524">And I really think that's what our case comes down to so far as Peter is concerned.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="4876.468" offset="19505842">The third case is the Jakobson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.862" offset="19531442">Let me say at the outset, that Jakobson seems to us to have a very serious and substantial claim, that his opposition to war does rest on religious training and belief within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4898.866" offset="19595389">Indeed for me, the very contrast between Jakobson's background life and thought than Peter's is the most persuasive evidence that Peter's opposition to war is not ground for classification as a conscientious objector, within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4919.129" offset="19676473">And I think the two are quite distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.638" offset="19694550">Jakobson first registered with his local board on September 2nd, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.389" offset="19725479">At that time, he made no claim to be classified as a conscientious objector, but forwarded a doctor's certificate indicating that he had a disabled back ailment, but he was classified 1-A.</text>
            <text syncTime="4944.009" offset="19775948">He sought that was given a student deferment but nothing was said about conscientious objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.716" offset="19802802">In January '56, where he took a leave of absence from college, he then was reclassified 1-A.</text>
            <text syncTime="4959.101" offset="19836343">He again submitted his doctor's certificate pertaining to his back, and seeking deferment on grounds of health.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.214" offset="19876780">When he was accepted for the army physically, then for the first time, he claimed in a letter to his draft board, that he ought to be classified as a conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="4981.650" offset="19926518">Then he asked at that time to be classified at Section 1 (a) (o), which would require it to enter the armed forces, but would exempt him from combatant training and belief, that he was granted that exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.866" offset="19987435">Now sooner when he got that exemption then he wrote and he said he decided that -- that wasn't was what he was entitled to by reason of his beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.462" offset="20017842">And he asked for exemption classification as 1-O, which would excuse him from taking or getting a part in the military service at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5016.402" offset="20065593">That was denied by the local draft board.</text>
            <text syncTime="5019.707" offset="20078759">He then appealed to the Appeal Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.512" offset="20090044">The Appeal Board treating the case de novo as it is obliged to do, classified him 1-A.</text>
            <text syncTime="5031.405" offset="20125571">The Appeal Board or rather the hearing officer of the Appeal Board, based his recommendation that submit Jakobson be classified 1-A upon two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.718" offset="20174785">First he said that Jakobson's claim was based on a personal moral code and that he was not sincere in his belief, that the second was lack of sincerity and first the moral code.</text>
            <text syncTime="5056.083" offset="20224313">The Appeal Board simply voted four to nothing, to deny the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="5062.819" offset="20251272">Jakobson also refused to submit to induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.584" offset="20270289">The District Court entered a judgment of conviction and Jakobson's appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5074.571" offset="20298188">The Second Circuit, we think correctly, said that it couldn't tell of which theory the Appeal Board's determination went.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.520" offset="20334028">That therefore either was inadequate, the conviction must be reversed with the Selective Service System free to take whatever further action it deemed appropriately.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.967" offset="20383765">The Second Circuit then inquired whether into Jakobson's view assuming their sincerity, amounted to religious training and belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.393" offset="20429531">And a belief in a Supreme Being to whom obligations superior to those above men existed within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.789" offset="20471118">And in an opinion by Judge Friendly that the Court concluded that Jakobson did have such beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.461" offset="20505809">Again, I emphasize the question is simply whether the record permits the draft board to come to a contrary conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.383" offset="20549486">We do not quarrel in any material respect with Judge Friendly's interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.157" offset="20584594">I'm also not inclined that to stress any difference really, as to whether Jakobson's presentation of his views about the nature of God, fails to come within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5160.166" offset="20640601">They are remarkably similar to those of that Professor Tillich, Dr. Robinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.504" offset="20669962">It does seem to us, however, that the record supports the conclusion that his views about war, what everybody think about the existence or nature of what he call goodness or another occasions as supreme reality, had very little -- that they had very little to do with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="5190.088" offset="20760346">That his argumentation about war was essentially of political, humanitarian, political philosophy what you put in that sense, humanitarian or a personal moral code.</text>
            <text syncTime="5205.568" offset="20822204">He stated his objections at two places that appear in the record, one is R-46 to 48, the other is R-114, 150.</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.037" offset="20872046">And they come to an end of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5220.641" offset="20882495">His first objection was that war is violently destructive, killing thousands of innocent person, destroying cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.500" offset="20917917">He says all the creative effort, all the time and money, all that could and should go into the effort to relieve poverty and combat disease, is channeled into destruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.578" offset="20958250">This I submit is a judgment that the community is called upon to make of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="5246.240" offset="20984895">The second reason is that, the soldiers on the other side are often as innocent as the soldiers on our side.</text>
            <text syncTime="5256.131" offset="21024496">Third, he says that war springs from and generates a moral intellectual and emotional atmosphere that breeds further violence and more wars.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.502" offset="21062008">The ends we all desire do not justify the methods of war, he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5270.239" offset="21080921">But I also believe that the methods of war are not a practical means to the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.926" offset="21099624">But again I think that he argued it in terms of that policy or politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5280.122" offset="21120418">And then he says finally, the better way to bring about a peaceful world is for individual whose experience is directing is for individuals, whose conscience is directed to do so, to stand against the core of the problem by refusing to adopt the techniques of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.071" offset="21192202">That again is in terms of how to bring about the democratic political, social, humanitarian ideals that the community holds and that the community is charged in determining how to promote.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.920" offset="21259598">It does not lift the argument as I see it to the different or higher realm in the sense of transcendent, that the statute refers to when it speaks about obligation beyond those arising among men.</text>
