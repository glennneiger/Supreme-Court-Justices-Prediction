            <text syncTime="21.393" offset="85473">These are suits for wrongful death under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.512" offset="117969">They arise out of the collision of a Capital Airlines Viscount plane and a T-33 military jet owned by the United States and used by the Air National Guard of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.058" offset="200202">The crash took place in May of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.455" offset="225802">This case gets to the Court under rather unusual conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.460" offset="253806">There were two sets of suits started, one in Pittsburgh and the other in District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.158" offset="288601">The District of Columbia suit was heard first on the issue of whether McCoy, the pilot of the jet T-33 was in fact an air maintenance air technician employed by the United States under Section 709 and therefore a caretaker of the aircraft at the time of the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.019" offset="427990">The District of Columbia, through Judge Mathews held a hearing on that, and found that he was, that the United States was liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.988" offset="479922">Thereafter judgment was entered for damages and in the meantime the same suit by other passengers, the Capital Airlines plane came out to be heard in Pittsburgh.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore E. Wolcott</label>
            <text syncTime="184.856" offset="739370">Yes sir, the government takes the stand that at the time McCoy was piloting the T-33, he was on a training mission as a military member of the Maryland Air National Guard and that therefore under the usual run of the Air National Guard cases there is no liability, whereas we take the position and the lower courts up to the circuit, Third Circuit held that McCoy at that time was serving in his function as caretaker air technician of the aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.851" offset="923376">But the interesting thing about this case is that at the trial in Pittsburgh, Judge Gorrelli (ph) by a stipulation of all counsel, including government counsel, stipulated that the record in the District of Columbia would be the record in Pittsburgh and so we have a situation where the record is identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.637" offset="1030478">Meantime in the District of Columbia the government went up on appeal on this issue of whether McCoy was an air technician, maintenance technician under 709 or that he was purely a military member on a training flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.731" offset="1098919">The District of Columbia Circuit unanimously affirmed, writing an opinion through Judge Faye, finding that McCoy definitely was a care -- acting in a capacity of a caretaker at the time and this was not a training flight.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore E. Wolcott</label>
            <text syncTime="298.983" offset="1195886">Yes sir the District Court plus the Circuit Court of Appeals and – for Washington Circuit and of course the Pittsburgh Court also found it.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.672" offset="1246668">In the meantime the government had also appealed from the Pittsburgh decision and I would argue that while the awaiting the decision of District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.980" offset="1291912">The District of Columbia decision came down first and I supplied the Third Circuit with copies of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.528" offset="1330051">Then the government applied to this Court for certiorari and certiorari was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.120" offset="1356382">I supplied the Third Circuit with a copy of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.787" offset="1379056">Then a few months later the Third Circuit came down with the decision and this is on exactly the same record Your Honors, and with the District of Columbia Circuit decision before them and they reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.167" offset="1460663">It was a split decision and the majority I might say, I think it fairly can be stated that the majority was divided as between themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.853" offset="1519386">Judge Smith wrote an opinion in which he interestingly enough made his own finding of fact, as I point out in the brief, disregarding the rule – on Rule 52, which is the less clearly the erroneous rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.010" offset="1639967">Judge Smith --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="410.804" stopTime="415.614">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="410.804" offset="1643207">Did he find that the findings of the trial court was clearly erroneous in that respect?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="theodore_e_wolcott" startTime="415.614" stopTime="628.169">
            <label>Mr. Theodore E. Wolcott</label>
            <text syncTime="415.614" offset="1662433">Well, what he did Your Honor was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.514" offset="1674031">He said that since most of the record was by stipulation, he was in as good position as the trial court to make his own findings and therefore he was not bound by the clearly erroneous rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.830" offset="1763265">I might comment on that by saying that the trial court had four witnesses, live witnesses before it, that is Judge Mathews here at the District of Columbia, as well as some depositions and it strikes me that if the clearly erroneous rule applies to a Circuit Court of the same circuit reviewing the testimony, it certainly would apply even more so to a court once removed as as the Third Circuit was and furthermore if that rule were to obtain then certainly counsel would be less likely to ever stipulate into the record a situation – as here because then they would be faced with an appellate court disregarding that is clearly erroneous rule and and there would be no incentive to save the time and trial of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.420" offset="2021669">Anyway Judge Smith held -- he went on two points; firstly he held, that he would disregard the whole line of caretaker cases, the Holly line of decisions, which hold there where a caretaker maintenance man hired and paid by the United States under a Federal Statute operates a vehicle even though he is a non-activated military member of the State National Guard, the government is nevertheless liable because he is an employee hired to take care of the property and there are the whole line of Holly decisions, about four or five in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.086" offset="2224274">He also disregarded the Meyer decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.970" offset="2235873">He stated that he just didn't see any distinction between a caretaker and a member of the National Guard for the purposes of liability under FTCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.955" offset="2291775">Then he went further and he said even assuming that McCoy was an employee under Section 709, nevertheless the United States not liable because this he found was not a flight in which he performed any duties as civil air maintenance caretaker, but it was a training flight and as to that point to say that, that is entirely contrary to the findings of both district courts, entirely contrary to the finding of the anonymous court in the District of Colombia Court of Appeals and also totally unsupported by the record and also a situation where the Court decided to the make its own new and contrary findings of fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="642.315" offset="2569195">And it’s the same uniform as the U.S Air Force.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.444" offset="2581734">Now if I may to go back into the background of this, the organization of the Air National Guard is very detailed and its founded upon a federal statutory structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.433" offset="2661669">There are a complete set of statutes under which the Air National Guard is setup.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.287" offset="2689045">It's really a part as it is stated in 32 U.S 101 or 102 that the Air National Guard and the National Guard is a part of our first line of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.843" offset="2755291">This is not the case anymore gentlemen where you have, when little malicious of the old days where they just stopped riots or worked in that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.554" offset="2798132">This is a 104th Fighter Interceptor Squadron using high powered, intricate armed aircraft that have as their range over a number of states and are part of a uniform integrated national organization supervised by the National Guard Bureau located in the Pentagon.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.748" offset="2918922">And every detail of the training is written in regulations of the Air Force issued by the Secretary of the Air Force and closely supervised in every detail with regular Air Force people stationed at the base supervising.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.108" offset="3012336">The United States finances this, every detail from top to the bottom, it supplies the equipment including this aircraft which was owned but the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.914" offset="3059566">This aircraft being so intricate, a lot of the instruments of warfare that is supplied by the United States to this National Guard being so expense and intricate, they have to develop a highly specialized and trained force of technicians, so that the weekend warriors when they come can take out this very intricate and expensive equipment and fly it.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.944" offset="3167713">In an airplane that is particularly necessary because you need a lot of preventive maintenance, because if something goes wrong and you're in the air it's too late, you've got to do it before it gets into the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.826" offset="3223301">So they developed this core of technicians which the United States provided for the care of its own equipment and McCoy was one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.918" offset="3263634">Under Section 709, they provide for the creation of this core of maintenance technicians, provide for payment, provide for fixing of hours, and rate of pay and then there is series of intricate detailed regulations which govern these technicians; leave, rates of pay, qualifications, manning schedule and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.089" offset="3352346">They can't just pick anybody out, they have to be qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.398" offset="3365512">McCoy was trained under a government program.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.825" offset="3383275">He spent nine months at Cannon Air Force Base at government expense, where he was trained as an air technician, so he could qualify to maintain this government equipment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3062.710" offset="12250802">Your Honor that was, he was sent to the Federal School in his military capacity as an officer of the Air National Guard as is frequently done in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.809" offset="12295210">We think that this indicates that the Federal Government has a close relationship with the Guard, but it's not a basis for distinguishing between the guard in his military capacity and the guard in his civilian capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.014" offset="12344007">In each capacity, they are hired by the commanding officers subject to the approval of the Adjutant General, in each they are supervised and directed by the same person and in each they wear the same uniform, in each capacity, they are a paid by checks drawn on the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.214" offset="12396774">But in each capacity, the states acting through the Adjutant General under the direction and supervision of the Governor has the right to select the people, to direct them, to set the working hours and conditions and to tell them when, where, and what to do and when to do it and this we think is the critical test under the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.333" offset="12493322">In addition to the lack of a rational distinction between the personnel in their military capacity and those in their civilian capacity, we have a long-standing congressional intent and understanding that they be considered employees of the states rather than -- than federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.562" offset="12562181">Ever since 1920 or before when the Act was new this has been the administrative interpretation and as I've indicated before, it's in the very regulations under which this man was hired that he is a state employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.872" offset="12619442">Moreover, it's been adopted by Congress as a basis for action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.985" offset="12635847">For example, in 1954 because these persons were not employees, where not considered to be employees within the meaning of the Civil Service Retirement Act, Congress adopted -- amended the Social Security Bill and said that for those purposes they shall “be deemed to be employees of the state.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.328" offset="12709303">Similarly retirement legislation allowing payroll deductions for state retirement funds was based and this quote is set forth on page 36 of our brief on the understanding of these employees although paid from federal funds are considered to be state rather than federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.244" offset="12784953">And as I've indicated earlier, we think the very adoption the National Guard Claims Act itself, Congress recognized there was no rational basis for distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.397" offset="12833541">And in regard to both of these, Congress shows to provide an administrative and legislative remedy rather than a judicial remedy and we think the type of remedy which should be afforded is clearly a policy matter for Congress in that it's policy decision should be honored by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.932" offset="12919641">In both capacities, we think there is a close analogy between a government doing things with the assistance and if you will through the state and the government doing it through independent contractors and the Tort Claims Act although recognizing -- the Tort Claims Act shows we think that it was not intended to resume tort liability for persons merely because the government paid the bill and then in ultimate sense controlled the program because Congressmen express exception to the Tort Claims Act for the employees of independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.766" offset="13071047">Similarly, we think that the program here, the National Guard program is closely analogous Mr. Justice Goldberg to similar programs where the Federal Government supplies part or whole of the money to the state setting forth criterion standards which the states must meet in order to get that Federal money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.447" offset="13149727">If the state did not wish to have National Guard troops or didn't wish to have a unit, they would be perfectly free to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.435" offset="13497678">Well, the easy answer is that they do it in the military side, as well as on the civilian side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.175" offset="13520666">I am not perfectly sure Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.203" offset="13528712">It is my understanding that there are other programs of this kind, but I am not positive and I wouldn't want to give you a firm answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.709" offset="13562776">Let me say in the answer to Mr. Justice White's question a few minutes ago that one of the basis for the Holly Line of decisions which has said that these are civilian employees was that the -- that the authority of Adjutant General was delegated to him that was basically a state authority, no a Federal Authority and I think I've already refuted that by reference to the legislative history of the 1935 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.007" offset="13675938">The other basis for -- another basis for the Holly decision was that the Federal Government is supplying these technicians in order to maintain federal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.925" offset="13719615">But the National Defense Act that which caretaker statutes is a part sets forth expressly the fact that the maintenance of property is the state function and responsibility just as the training and the other operations of the National Guard are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.320" offset="13777189">And lastly the Holly decision rested upon the idea that the Adjutant General was merely acting, the Adjutant General of the state was merely acting as an agent of the Federal Government in administering this caretaker program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.703" offset="13830792">That is wholly incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.283" offset="13837061">The Adjutant General is appointed and subject to the direction and control of the Governor of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.008" offset="13859944">Indeed in many instances the Adjutant General is not even a federally recognized officer of the National Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.135" offset="13884500">He is appointed and subject to the direction and control of the state government and all his conducts, all his actions are done by order of the Governor as it is indicated in this case in page 662 and 663 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.923" offset="13947611">You'll see the change of McCoy status from one air technician status to another and it says Adjutant General by order of the Governor, that's the way the Adjutant General administers this whole program, both the military side and the civilian.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.734" offset="13998916">Now, lastly I would like to turn briefly to the question of what capacity he was acting in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.415" offset="14017620">The orders at the moment, this is our alternative position, the orders which are set forth in page 209 indicate that he was ordered to fly in his military capacity as a military member of the guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.842" offset="14067357">It was assigned by order of the squadron commander that is the person who gave him the direction was the squadron commander.</text>

            <text syncTime="3804.116" offset="15216431">He himself thought that when he perform these functional test flights he was doing so in his military capacity as aircraft maintenance -- I’m sorry as squadron maintenance officer which was his military function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.620" offset="15274423">But we don’t think it is necessary to go that far Your Honor, because this was concededly not a functional test flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.536" offset="15302113">The only function, the only maintenance functions which he performed here were looking at the instruments and seeing how the airplane flew, the same thing any pilot does at anytime and the critical test under Maryland law is who has the right to supervise and direct and control and that test we think here is met only by the state with the right to direct and control was wholly in state officials acting under the general supervision and direction of the Adjutant General and the Governor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3927.716" offset="15710772">Indeed it would be very anomalous Your Honor if I may just conclude on this note, to say that for the entire work week these people are civilian employees and therefore under the control of the federal government and that the only time the state asserts its control over the National Guard is on the weekend when they have a training drill, because 20% of the personnel are they are on the base working in their civilian capacity all during the week and the Governors we think would be very shocked and surprised to learn that they didn’t have control over the National Guard when it was not in active federal service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.900" offset="15871582">We think the relationship is the same for all rational purposes, the only distinction being whether someone is subject to court marshal or not, during the week he would not be, during weekend he would.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.240" offset="15912960">But as far as any relevant criteria, we don’t think there are any basic distinctions.</text>
