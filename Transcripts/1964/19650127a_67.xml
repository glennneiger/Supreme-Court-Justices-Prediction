            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="21.934" offset="87667">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.773" offset="103027">After listening to Louisiana's Attorney General on yesterday, whose argument I must say was marked by commendable frankness.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.610" offset="142420">I was prepared to submit my case with a very few words.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.305" offset="161123">Unfortunately, I had a full evening to reconsider and doubtless influenced by any lawyers' reluctance to be cheated out of this argument, I found there is yet to a good deal to be said.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.180" offset="212637">Nevertheless, I hope not to trespass on the Court's time and not to use my full allotted time.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.698" offset="242730">As I understood Louisiana's argument yesterday, it was in effect this, assuming that serious discrimination against the Negro in his exercise of the franchise had been perpetrated in the past under the rule of the old interpretation test, Louisiana says that is behind us.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.162" offset="336562">Louisiana has voluntarily abandoned that old discriminatory device and has now enacted a brand new, uniform, written, objective test which is unexceptional.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.764" offset="391001">As to the past, they say, let us forgive and forget now that the State has began a fresh apparently in good faith using a model suggested by the Department of Justice itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.827" offset="451291">Therefore, there is no occasion even to outlaw the old test.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.776" offset="467069">It has been abandoned and that issue is moot says South Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.420" offset="485669">As to the new test, neither the court below nor the Government has challenged its constitutionality in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.842" offset="523285">Accordingly, says the state, it's improper to enjoin its use and especially to enjoin its use only in 21 parishes thereby creating a disparity with the other 43 who are permitted to continue using it.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.045" offset="588173">Now, there is a -- the suggestion that the injunction against the new citizenship test might be appropriate as a means of placing the Negro today on apparently with the white who is illegally registered in former times by saying let those Negroes who feel that they were discriminated against come in and challenge the illegally registered white voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.334" offset="713247">In Louisiana, we have a very convenient, easy challenge procedure and they may simply look through the rolls and purge the white voters who are illegally registered without taking a test and the effects of that past discrimination where it might be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.074" offset="800287">Unfortunately, it's not as easy as all that.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.920" offset="819618">Even if there were some basis who believing that Louisiana has turned over a new leaf and there are strong indications to the contrary as I will show.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.772" offset="871027">The decree ended below in every respect was appropriate and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.962" offset="903837">You cannot leave the interpretation test on the books, not in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.783" offset="931109">The requirement that applicants be able to understand and interpret give a reasonable interpretation of any section of the Federal or State Constitution when read to him by the registrar is still part of the law of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.625" offset="986488">It is still enshrined in the Constitution of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.184" offset="1000699">It is still implemented by statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.049" offset="1020134">When the new test was enacted in 1962, the old was not repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.860" offset="1043435">There is no conceivable room for argument that the new test, as a matter of state law, supplemented the old.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.587" offset="1078335">Even the Board of Registration whose discretion in this matter may be questioned has not explicitly directed registrars to stop using the old test and indeed, as was mentioned by one of the justices, “Yes it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.782" offset="1139043">The record shows that one of the registrars at least continued to use the old test after the Board's new rules and new test have been promulgated.”</text>
            <text syncTime="297.617" offset="1190452">Furthermore, according to the Constitution, the old test is not optional, it's mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.693" offset="1214694">The criminal penalties imposed which can be invoked against registrars who failed to apply the Louisiana laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.729" offset="1246877">The Attorney General, I assume, is in the position to assure the Court that no such prosecutions would be instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.392" offset="1281567">But on the other hand, the test has been shelved.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.203" offset="1304764">For three decades, it was shelved after it was first passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.878" offset="1319497">It was revived and resurrected when the need arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.102" offset="1336320">That may well happen again.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.312" offset="1349172">Louisiana has not always taken the same position with respect to this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.644" offset="1370488">For a long time it was apparently viewed as purely optional up to any registrar to use it as it saw fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.896" offset="1395566">In 1956 through 1961, Louisiana officials or some of them at the highest state level took the position that the test was mandatory and that any registrar who declined to use it was subject to removal and even to criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.137" offset="1468500">So, Louisiana has blown hot and cold on this issue of whether the test is in fact subject to being shelved.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.162" offset="1516565">Even now, it is possible to purge a voter who prior to 1962 was allegedly registered without taking the test on the ground that the test was then enforced and that he was therefore illegally registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.157" offset="1600575">Indeed that is the suggestion made for Negroes as to whites who were registered without taking the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.051" offset="1632131">In short, the test if it was valid has the continuing effect in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.919" offset="1659611">Now, under existing circumstances, as I say, there can be no assurance with the test will not be revived at some later time or some other administration in some parishes if not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.367" offset="1717394">Negroes not without reason will continue to be deterred by the knowledge that this so-called weapon of discrimination which has been so effectively used against them in the past may be invoked against in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.362" offset="1777371">They are entitled to have the registrars stripped of this weapon altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.054" offset="1828153">Therefore, the general injunction issued by the court below against the interpretation test, against the use of the interpretation test throughout Louisiana, which incidentally was the only issue appealed in the notice to appeal in the jurisdictional statement filed in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.597" offset="1894296">It does remain the central issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.005" offset="1911954">There is of course another reason why we cannot erase the interpretation test from the case and that is because the discrimination it accomplished has not been erased in fact and cannot be erased without further relief, which is justified only by considering the effect which the interpretation test had during its stay.</text>

            <text syncTime="1924.131" offset="7696509">And this cannot be attributed to any accident or to any claim that it was a general upgrading of registration standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.524" offset="7765995">It is -- the figures simply cannot bear out the claim that so many Negroes are incapable of passing the test, and yet almost all whites are capable of passing the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.381" offset="7833496">Nor is much to be attributed to the so-called Negro apathy in these parishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.348" offset="7857319">And that is illustrated by comparing the parishes that use the test and their neighboring parishes which do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.835" offset="7891278">For instance in -- on this little map, De Soto Parish in the left hand side of the map had a registration rate of 9%, whereas Sabine Parish right below it, this is Negro registration rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3614.907" offset="14459611">I do want to cover just a few high points.One, with respect to Justice Stewart's statement of our conceding something, I will explain that but wait for him to return to the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.314" offset="14513215">And secondly, a very important thing, a very important consideration that was brought into these discussions by Justice White, it is apparent from the government's argument that they have set as Justice Black just mentioned a moment ago the idea and the image that with this 90% of registered white people and only a very small percentage of Negroes, that that is a permanent thing because of the system of permanent registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.122" offset="14624392">That is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.132" offset="14632438">It is apparent and I think that we can take notice of the fact that there is a tremendous removal and transfer and moving around of our population during these days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.229" offset="14672875">And, although we, as defendants, appellants here had not at the time because it didn't -- didn't at that stage of the thing seemed particularly appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.749" offset="14710909">There is enough documentary evidence in this record to show the total population and registration, not the population, the registration figures in the Parish of Orleans for instance over a period of some eight or ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.506" offset="14769946">Now, if you -- if this Court will start in that, you will notice that although those percentages that the government presents to you and then leaves the image that this is a permanent and unchangeable thing, that in those eight or ten years, the registration totals in City of New Orleans, which is also synonymous with the Parish of Orleans, is down 10,000 registered voters approximately and that during that same period, there has been an increase in the registration of the Negro registered voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.529" offset="14910067">They're -- under the provisions of Louisiana law, there are automatic, systematic statutory requirements that at the end of each four-year period there'd be under this permanent registration removals made from the rules as a result of death removals, moving out of the parishes, notices from other registrars, that a person has moved to that parish and he's eliminated from the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.195" offset="14996689">And, necessarily it is true as a matter of mathematics in that instance, that when a person does remove from Orleans Parish to one of the others and registrars had notices sent, this white person has taken off and the result from the 90% that are registered, you're going to have more white people being taken off from day to day, it's -- it's inevitable, than there would be Negroes who moved around.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.335" offset="15089267">Those percentages are going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.766" offset="15098984">The result is, and I repeat, that a study of the statistics filed in this record from using Orleans as one of the examples because it has the biggest population parish of the State will show that over this period, there are 10,000 less registered voters in Orleans Parish today than there was a year or ten years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.223" offset="15176829">It is less white persons registered and more Negroes were despite this reduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3893.574" offset="15574204">But by the same token, even though those things have taken place and we agree, I am arguing here that this Court or any court of equity, in that respect, can in so doing, not strike down a state law that is entirely valid and it is agreed by everyone here to be valid, to -- to prescribe minimum qualifications and standards and I would like to -- to illustrate that point.</text>
