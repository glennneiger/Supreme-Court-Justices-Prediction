            <label>Mr. Leon B. Polsky</label>
            <text syncTime="157.818" offset="631223">Because in order to release him from the present detention, you must destroy the order which is the basis of holding the man in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.862" offset="671347">You must vacate the sentence part of the judgment under which the defendant is being held.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="181.514" offset="725995">Is your point, I suppose that this is the equivalent as though this man were in jail without any trial at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.301" offset="753162">And just as, because you say he is unconstitutionally there, certainly if a person were picked up and arrested and put in jail for a term of years without any trial at all, that would be quite obviously unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.350" offset="805303">You are saying therefore, he is entitled to his release and then, it's up to the state whether or not they want to try him fairly and squarely in accordance of the constitution, is that right.</text>

            <text syncTime="220.882" offset="883461">I think there can be a distinction made between the present detention, because the statute makes that distinction.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="227.443" offset="909688">Yes, but if you have to reach the trial order, you have to reach the conviction and the order resulting from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.719" offset="938841">It really boils down to one argument, so at some point, you are going to have to get to upsetting that conviction?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leon_b_polsky" startTime="240.666" stopTime="555.897">
            <label>Mr. Leon B. Polsky</label>
            <text syncTime="240.666" offset="962664">Yes, oh! at some there will, in order to retry the man, well though to be quite honest, in the several cases where -- that I have seen, where writs have been sustained by Federal Courts and a retrial order, a conditional retrial order has been made, there has never been any formal action taken in the State Court to vacate the initial conviction of, all that happened is, he was brought back in and they picked up where they left off and started all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.154" offset="1096516">I think, if we get involved in the mechanics of the way a State Court handles its own judgments, I don't think you can let that control your approach to your power under the statute and your disposition of this case, but here Angelet says, that I am brining this case to the District Court and I am presenting the District Court with a certain set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.559" offset="1226188">And I ask you to decide, either that my present detention or my past conviction violated the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.911" offset="1259624">The State in response to this says to the District Judge or to whichever Appellate Court it goes to, passing from the question, in weighing the facts of this case and disposing of this case, we don't ask you to do what courts have always done, mainly look at it and decide it, we ask you to look at it and then say, well I am going to apply a particular law to this case, a law that is 14 years old, is 18 years old, is six years old, courts when they decide cases, decide cases on the law as it is at the time they decide their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.754" offset="1434958">We ask that the validity of this conviction or the validity of the present detention be judged on the basis of the law as it is when you decide this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.363" offset="1481352">If at that time, you come to render your decision in this case, you decide that Mapp against Ohio should be overruled, then George Angelet should not get out of prison, because at the time of the decision of this case that would not be the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.240" offset="1560869">This man's rights under the Fourth Amendment would not be violated on the basis of the law as you see it at the time you render your decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.087" offset="1604336">Now in our brief, we have the taken the unpopular course of defending Mr. Justice Blackstone and Mr. Justice Holmes.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.568" offset="1646237">We do it because we think that although the rule has been criticized and a large extent, soundly criticized, the criticism is based upon a misconception of what the rule of retrospectivity is.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.874" offset="1715409">The rule of retrospectivity contains within it, all of the palliatives, which would prevent the harsh results that jurists like Justice Cardozo foresaw in unlimited retrospectivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.778" offset="1803076">For example, res judicata is a defense in a case where a plaintiff sues claiming upon new law, which overruled a case which previously disposed in his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.776" offset="1887086">In a typical civil case, a suit is brought, judgment is rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.193" offset="1908715">If subsequently the law changes and the plaintiff now sees that he might win under the present state of the law and he brings suit, the defendant comes in and does not say that the law is today what it was three years ago when you lost your suit, but he says res judicata and the court never gets to decide the question of whether we should apply today's law or yesterday's law.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.588" offset="2018325">There is a principle which prevents the court ever reaching the question of what law it is to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.883" offset="2055523">Similarly, the doctrine of legitimate reliance or justifiable reliance, which was the prime motivation for Justice Cardozo's challenge to the concept of retrospectivity, is also applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.178" offset="2108709">This is an equitable defense in many cases, in most cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.084" offset="2140264">If the state in this case, legitimately relied upon Wolf against Colorado, and if the state in this case can show that it has been injured by its reliance, legitimate reliance, upon Wolf against Colorado perhaps that would be an equitable defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="563.170" offset="2252591">Their position is that they have legitimately relied upon Wolf, while they say in their brief they do not condone the conduct of the police officers who broke into this man's home and ransacked it for an hour-and-a-half, while they do not condone that, they say that the prosecutor and the trial court and the whole judicial set up of the state of New York had no part in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.849" offset="2363350">They washed their hands of the conduct of the police officers and they say therefore, we are not the ones who violated the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.004" offset="2403997">We didn't do anything other than what this court told us we could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.558" offset="2426149">I submit that is not so, that it is not reliance nor is it justified reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.629" offset="2454465">The state in this case offered this evidence, we contend knowing that it was obtained in violation of what this court said in Wolf that the Fourth Amendment applies to State Officers through the Fourteenth and Wolf -- this was spelled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.285" offset="2561045">Wolf did not say the Fourth Amendment either alone or through the Fourteenth does not apply to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.896" offset="2567523">In Wolf, this court said it does, but there is nothing that we see that we now can do about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.054" offset="2596153">The state relied upon the hope that this Court would never do anything about it, but the state does not -- I cannot see how the state can say that they acted honorably in using this evidence, that they acted with justification and that they did not know that they were violating this man's rights and condoning the violation by the police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.549" offset="2706181">This is the same situation as in the coerced confession cases or the jury exclusion cases where state after state has come in and said, putting in this confession, it was the police officer who beat the prisoner not the District Attorney and not the Trial Court judge or in excluding persons from the array in a jury, it was not the court that did it or the District Attorney who did it, but it was some lowly clerk who did it on his own.</text>

            <text syncTime="1370.639" offset="5482475">The petitioner Angelet is today in confinement pursuant to a pre-Mapp narcotics conviction, which took place in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.581" offset="5530227">A trial in that year, that every test of constitutional fairness on the basis of law of it was for then or authoritatively interpreted by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.045" offset="5584144">Now broadly stated, the question here and the questions from the bench indicated that is not an easy question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.529" offset="5630015">If it is to what extent does a change in law and changes of course are inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.612" offset="5670348">A change resulting from judicial reinterpretation justify the reopening of prior cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.777" offset="5711099">Cases which have been fully tried without error on the basis of law as it was then authoritatively formulated by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.029" offset="5752059">Now, there is no one easy answer to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.163" offset="5768568">We recognize that there are a number of situations where reopening closed cases as a result of evolutionary interpretation or reinterpretation of law is not only appropriate, but may even be essential if justice is to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.344" offset="5857280">Our position is not that there are no proper cases for retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.845" offset="5883298">At the same time, we must recognize that there are categories of closed cases, where re-opening on federal habeas corpus is inappropriate and we believe destructive of sound judicial administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.985" offset="5951843">It is our position that the case at bar falls into this category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.629" offset="5974413">I think we have to begin our analysis, by drawing the distinction, which has been drawn consistently in lower courts or state and federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.218" offset="6020807">The distinction between review on direct appeal and review on collateral attack, on post conviction remedy of decisions which are no longer reviewable on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.123" offset="6088411">The extraordinary post conviction writs, especially habeas corpus serve a very vital function in appropriate cases, but they cannot be chaotically substituted for an orderly system of normal judicial appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.275" offset="6177019">Now this distinction has they said been frequently recognized, cases still pending can properly be given retroactive benefit of new rule, whether the new rule is judicial or statutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.649" offset="6250580">In a number of situations where closed cases should not be given the benefit of a new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.692" offset="6278687">Now, it's not illogical to draw this distinction because there are compelling policy reasons, which say that it is essential to an economical judicial system to follow normal procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.152" offset="6368549">Now recognizing this distinction that we draw between direct appeal where we recognize retroactivity as proper, what amount of cases where retroactivity is proper on collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.577" offset="6438243">When should a judicially adopted change in law be given retroactive effect as to these closed cases on post-conviction collateral attackNow I've read the decisions of this court and there are number of recent ones which are in point and it seems to me that one big category of case that explains just about every decision which has been retroactively applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.618" offset="6558407">Our decisions whenever there is any possible doubt as to the reliability of the guilt finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.480" offset="6597904">If there is any possibility of failure of process, it involved lack of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.672" offset="6630609">There is doubt as to the reliability of the guilt finding process when a man is tried in a criminal prosecution without a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.077" offset="6672300">Those cases should and have been retroactively applied on collateral attack and the Second Circuit itself from which this, to which this petition has been directed allowed retroactive attack in a Gideon type situation by a 7:2 majority and denied retroactivity in the instant case by a similar 7:2 vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.814" offset="6783164">In Griffin, there was a less complete adjudication because the accused was unable to afford a transcript, which again bar on at least a possible doubt as to the complete reliability of the guilt finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.663" offset="6862576">It hasn't been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.688" offset="6870727">In Jackson against Denno, the guilt finding process was less reliable because of emotional overtones resulting from letting a jury hear a confession before determining its voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.700" offset="6938749">These are cases where there is a possibility of safeguarding the innocent and it seems to me if that possibility exists in the case, there is a very strong reason for applying it retroactively, the new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.852" offset="7015340">It seems to me that at any case where the basic purpose of the rule can be advanced by applying it retroactively and that is also a case for retroactive application, and there maybe special circumstances such in the interest of justice such as physical brutality or violence, but none of those reasons as we have analyzed the case before I see here appear to be present.</text>

            <text syncTime="1964.231" offset="7856901">That a trial was considered fair and the law was that a lawyer needn't be present for a conviction to meet constitutional standards, then it changed with Gideon.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.254" offset="8152921">So this record meets the issue of retroactivity head on it seems to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.227" offset="8184895">The purpose of the rule as I understand it, and I think that it is the basic purpose is to prevent lawless law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.474" offset="8237871">It was suggested there were other possible ways of preventing lawless law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.033" offset="8260127">They didn't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.634" offset="8266501">California, which had adopted the Wolf type rule found it didn't work, a leading opinion by Mr. Justice Craner (ph) adopted the federal rule, not as a matter of constitutional right, but as a matter of sound judicial administration for this very purpose which was adverted to in the Court's opinion in Mapp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.240" offset="8388859">Now, if we are right in reading the opinion that this is the purpose, that purpose is served by applying Mapp in all cases of searches and seizures after Mapp was handed down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.861" offset="8467435">And it seems to me that, that is essentially sound and that could be raised on habeas corpus, if the state refuses to recognize it on principles of Brown against Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.000" offset="8519993">But to go back is any purpose served by applying the rule in cases such as this one where there is no question as to the reliability of the guilt finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.048" offset="8596167">Now there is another point which is going to be developed by Mr. Juviler, with respect to the possible inhibiting affect on the developing of development of evolving standards of judicial administration, it's easier to develop new standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.896" offset="8683520">If they -- if you don't have to reopen old cases every time, now I hope I've suggested, I'm going to bring my argument to a conclusion in view of the construction of Attorney General Lefkowitz have this further presentation, the Court it seems to me has in recent years made very great contributions towards developing fair standards of criminal trial practice, both state and federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.202" offset="8816744">And towards eliminating lawless law enforcement, which is one of the -- well it's a sad blot on our history, the lawless law enforcement we've had in some of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.009" offset="8872020">Now, if this were a case where enforcement retroactive application of the new Mapp rule, would in some significant way contribute to the improvement of standards or to improving the reliability of the guilt finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.813" offset="8939207">I could not expect affirmance on the record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.111" offset="8956343">But this is not the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2252.659" offset="9010573">Mr. Chief Justice and May I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.147" offset="9028545">As we come to the close of the lengthy arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.661" offset="9038576">In this case I propose that we turn our attention from the past to the future and address ourselves to the effects of this case on the future development of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.783" offset="9103047">There is no question that the forward progress of criminal justice in the United States has proceeded with the state courts in the advance guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.633" offset="9154456">The recent developments of procedures with respect to the right to counsel, the use of confessions and search and seizure, developments that have been announced in decisions of this Court can be traced to progressive decisions in our leading state courts that foreshadow the results to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.838" offset="9255288">And many of the state decisions went far beyond the constitutional requirements proceed in the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.958" offset="9295830">I suggest that if the continuing improvement of criminal justice is to be part of our constitutional development, that this Court not adopt the absolute principle of retroactivity proposed by the instant petitioner under which all improvements in criminal justice that reach the status of fundamental change must require reopening of previously closed cases and the development of the exclusionary rule itself points up this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.470" offset="9457789">The exclusionary rule was introduced into American Jurisprudence by a State Court, 11 years before this Court announced the Weeks Rule, subsequently, almost half of the states prior to Mapp voluntarily adopted exclusionary rules in their jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.944" offset="9539709">For example the High Court of California, People against Cahan, announced a decision which has frequently been cited in decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.402" offset="9577535">Yet the California Courts declined to apply their exclusionary rule retroactively and after this Court's decision in Mapp, every State Court that has had occasion to pass upon this question has held that the Mapp decision does not require reopening previously closed cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.035" offset="9696131">Of course, there are recurrent questions under the Fourth Amendment aside from the exclusionary rule, questions that were alluded to in this court's decision in Mapp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.420" offset="9745659">And if these questions are to be decided by state courts and lower federal courts on the basis of appropriate standards of fairness proper to present day procedures and present day needs of law enforcements, these troublesome questions cannot be decided under the shadow of the prospect that every new change and every contribution in the development of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence will require through Habeas Corpus or any procedure, a reexamination of every prior conviction that was entered under an earlier stage in this constitutional development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.171" offset="9920679">As we point out in our brief, many state courts and lower federal courts are wrestling under the Fourth Amendment with the problem whether under certain circumstances the defendant is entitled to disclosure of the identity of an informant whose communications to the police were relied upon to establish probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.543" offset="10034155">In every case that takes a liberal progressive view of the right of a defendant to disclosure of the informant's identity, the Fourth Amendment principles announced in Mapp have been held not retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.037" offset="10104059">And in other areas, then the Fourth Amendment in other continuing evolutions of rights through the Fourteenth Amendment, we can see the same process and we can predict the same restriction on the free development of criminal law, if this court announces that every fundamental improvement in criminal justice must require a reopening of all previously closed cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.086" offset="10224327">For example, the decision of this court in Escobedo was foreshadowed by decisions of a New York Court of Appeals has held that its ruling in People against Donovan is not retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.483" offset="10317845">As to the Escobedo case the High Court of California recently extended the principle of Escobedo to situations in which the defendant does not request counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.383" offset="10369463">Yet the same court in In re Lopez has held that the principles of Escobedo and Dorado are not retroactive and do not require a reexamination of previously rendered judgments of defendants who might have been tried under a different principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.218" offset="10448771">And only this Tuesday, the Appellate Division, first department of the Supreme Court of New York extended the Donovan and Escobedo principles to situations in which the defendant requests to see a member of his family, People against Taylor and Your Honors will note in reading that opinion which has not yet published, that the Court took specific pains to point out that they were rendering this decision in a case that was still in the normal appellate process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2661.727" offset="10646883">It should be clear from these examples and others which are cited it at greater length in our brief that the constitution of today is not the same constitution that this Court interpreted in 1949, but if this Court accepts the view that the constitution is the same today as in 1949, and that any fundamental addition to interpretations of that constitution require a reexamination of all past cases, then we may well reach a stage of development in which the constitution will remain the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.075" offset="10828278">It is too much to expect of these state courts which have accepted the invitation of this Court and the encouragement of this Court to extend the rights of defendants that this procedure will continue if the drastic remedy of retroactivity is entailed in every one of these new developments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.548" offset="10938096">And in the interest of encouraging the state courts to continue to expand the benefits available to present day defendants beyond those available to past defendants we urge the Court to reject the principle of absolute retroactivity that is entailed in petitioner's arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.902" offset="11027540">I wish to point out that these implications of the issues in this case are not limited to judgments rendered in the state courts and are not limited to the continuing development of constitutional principles in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.144" offset="11108519">If we accept the notion that every constitutional interpretation whether it be under the Fourth Amendments or any other of the amendments in the Bill of Rights require reexamination of previously closed cases on the premise that this is the same constitution that was before the Court in 1949 or 1953, then the federal judgments will be subject to reexamination and we trust that the lower federal courts which are contributing to the content of Due Process will be equally inhibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.114" offset="11272359">I note that the District Court for the Southern District of New York recently overruled the New York Court of Appeals on the question of the right to disclosure of the informant's identity on the question of probably cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.601" offset="11370371">But again this decision was rendered in a jurisdiction which under the Angelet case did not require reexamination of previously closed cases, whether they be federal or state convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.753" offset="11442991">If we could expect that the constitution of today would and should be the same as the constitution of ten years hence, then there would be no problem, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.667" offset="11494609">The problem of retroactivity itself can arise only in a constitutional system which invites change.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.933" offset="11535673">So that we -- when we examine the challenging question in this case as to how we can continue to detain persons whose convictions might have been unconstitutional, we must turn to the language of the majority in the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.979" offset="11623863">The word constitutional is not a talisman that carries magic results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.467" offset="11653851">We urge that it would be unconstitutional in large measure to apply an absolute principle of retroactivity, because the constitution invites change this Court has continuously encouraged change --</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.104" offset="12036389">Another implication aside from the content of specific rights in the Bill of Rights of a holding of retroactivity would be an obliteration of the boundaries between a judgment rendered and carried through the normal appellate process and the extraordinary remedy of collateral attack whether that collateral attack be in the Federal Courts or in the State Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3229.237" offset="12916924">Mr. Chief Justice, I am concerned by the argument that Mr. Juviler has made that our claim that Mapp would be applicable or that Mr. Angelet should be released under this decision would have an inhibiting factor, it would be an inhibiting factor on the growth and development of both the constitutional law generally and the law of search and seizure specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.646" offset="13042521">I don't think that either that is a problem in this case or that, that really is a problem in another case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.273" offset="13073032">If at some time in the future the Court would dispose to overrule or change one of its decisions or criteria for what is or is not an illegal or legal search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.303" offset="13141159">Prisoners previously convicted under the old decision very well might bring their petitions claiming under 2255 or Habeas Corpus, claiming relief, but they would be met at the threshold by the government's reply that they had legitimately relied upon what had been the decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.524" offset="13246067">That is what distinguishes this case from the hypothetical cases which the respondents have put forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.613" offset="13294446">What distinguishes this case is that there was an unconscionable wrong done and it was known to be just that at the time it was done, a mistake cannot now go back upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.216" offset="13380859">In answer to, I think the first question of Mr. Justice Stewart, illegally seized evidence is reliable evidence, it is devastatingly reliable evidence, but because --</text>

            <text syncTime="3363.083" offset="13452330">The same evidence that has been seized legally or illegally isn't it, and it's just reliable as it is or is unreliable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3369.629" offset="13478452">Particularly as in this case which is a possession case really the whole case is the proof that the material had been seized, that the defendant was possessed of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.155" offset="13532578">So not only is it reliable, but in this case it is the proof of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.758" offset="13559014">But is that the criteria for determining a man's right to relief in Federal Court, true, men without counsel if innocent might be convicted erroneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.759" offset="13634978">Men who have been beaten might confess falsely, but men have been beaten and given true confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.027" offset="13680013">Guilty men have been convicted without counsel and yet we apply the right uniformly because it is the right which is the important thing and it is that right which we ask this Court to vindicate, thanks.</text>
