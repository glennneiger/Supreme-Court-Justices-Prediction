            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="81.357" offset="430937">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.135" offset="446088">This second case involving Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 comes here on the government’s appeal from a decree of a three-judge court in the Northern District of Alabama, temporarily enjoining the acting Attorney General from taking any steps to enforce Title II against the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.282" offset="538666">The facts are simple and for the purposes of this appeal, they are undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.003" offset="561549">Appellees operate a restaurant in Birmingham, Alabama specializing in barbecue meats.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.093" offset="593837">They seek no transient trade by advertising and so far as they know, they serve no interstate guests.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.453" offset="635319">In the 12-month period prior to July 1, 1964, the appellees purchased about $150,000 worth of food.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.728" offset="676384">Included in that sum was about $70,000 worth of meat which was purchased from the Hormel Company at its Birmingham, Alabama plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.740" offset="720478">All the meat sold at that plant, about 40% of the appellees total purchases of food came from other states so that it moved in Interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.927" offset="773246">The District Court found that the appellees, not only practiced racial segregation at their restaurant prior to the enactment of the -- of the Title II, but since its enactment, they have consistently continued and will continue to violate the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.081" offset="841791">Prior to July 31, 1964, the Department of Justice had never heard of the appellees or of their restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.249" offset="886513">There's been no investigation and no specific threat to enforce compliance on the part of their restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.782" offset="920681">On that day nevertheless, the appellees commenced this action to enjoin the enforcement of Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.155" offset="946176">They alleged two kinds of irreparable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.255" offset="958506">First, they said that actions to enforce Title II by the Attorney General of the United States, all individual Negroes which subject them to the burdens inconvenience of expenses of litigation, and the aggravation of such burdens by a potential multiplicity of suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.122" offset="1029977">Second, they -- and the court below found, that the actual enforcement of the Act that it's a compliance with, would subject them to irreparable injury through a lost of customers and lost profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.130" offset="1090059">The government moved to dismiss the complaint upon two, essentially two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.894" offset="1117122">One was that the Court had no equity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.259" offset="1134572">The point was argued on several grounds that here we insist upon it in the form of the big no injury against which they're entitled to be protected by injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.028" offset="1173651">We also argued in the Court below and of course argue here that if the merits were reached, the act is constitutional as applied to the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.011" offset="1213566">The District Court ruled against the government on both grounds and issued an injunction temporarily enjoining the acting Attorney General from taking any steps to enforce the Act against the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.119" offset="1277932">Mr. Justice Black granted a stay on September 23rd and probable notice of jurisdiction was set forth in the order announced by the Chief Justice a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.473" offset="1331430">In this Court, we press the same two arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.932" offset="1349194">While we would welcome a broad ruling on the constitutionality of Title II as applied to the appellee's restaurant or any other restaurant, the District Court's assumption of jurisdiction here to enjoin the enforcement of the statute under these circumstances disturbs us so profoundly in its implication for the future administration of this and other statutes that we do feel compelled to insist upon that point as one of two grounds for reversal.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="343.735" offset="1480433">But you really would welcome a determination of the substantive constitutional issue, you could have very well counter claim here as you did in the case you just had argued, didn't you?</text>

            <text syncTime="363.667" offset="1560158">Well I suppose we could have accepted them, we didn't at that stage. Indeed in the court below, there was some argument, curious situation really developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.513" offset="1611567">The appellees were arguing the statute applies to us were in violation and the department was insisting that the violation hadn't been proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.296" offset="1642705">Now I don't take that position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.172" offset="1654199">I do say that except the findings below and as the statute applies for them, but we just don't feel able to waive this point.</text>

            <text syncTime="955.857" offset="3928942">There is no -- I'll point out several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.110" offset="3941899">First, that the statute contains no provision for damages, no provision for criminal prosecution, no provision for criminal or civil penalty and I tried to emphasize in my discussion of the statute this morning that it is limited in all cases to preventive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.031" offset="4033641">Second, I point out that the appellees now are suffering no injury or loss of any kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.820" offset="4144818">They don't complain that any customers are leaving them now and so far as we know, they're going on without suffering any injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.091" offset="4181912">The third I would emphasize as was suggested by Mr. Justice Brennan here that this is a statute which shows a good deal of discrimination in what suits we may bring and what suits we may not bring.</text>

            <text syncTime="1059.859" offset="4344916">He could go ahead and bring it again, bring his own suit, the first private suit, if it went against the private individual would have I suppose some effect as a precedent, just as much effect as the precedent I take it as the first suit against the Attorney General would have and no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.730" offset="4428403">But I take it finally that the expenses of defending an action brought by the Attorney General are no greater than the expenses of prosecuting an action against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.059" offset="4473752">Indeed, I should suppose that there would be somewhat less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.693" offset="4488276">So that here, what we have is simply no occasion for picking a quarrel with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.936" offset="4517220">Well, it maybe said it doesn't hurt the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.943" offset="4529236">Let it go ahead and learn to defend the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.379" offset="4546999">It seems to me there is three things that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.341" offset="4566852">In the first place, it is an established principle that a court will not unnecessarily decide constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.671" offset="4620142">That was a principle, the importance of which became very clear during the 1930 where the number of lower courts by holding acts of Congress unconstitutional delayed and interfered with the administration of important laws, postponed their effectiveness for two or three years while the issue was being litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.185" offset="4710212">This is of the utmost importance under many statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.917" offset="4725154">I take it would be under this statute where tremendously important to be part of it is achieving a voluntary accommodation and adjustment to the main and the entertaining of suits to declare the act unconstitutional without any reason increases the chance that it will be so held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.959" offset="4821389">Now I suppose that reason at this stage, Mr. Justice Black, hardly comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.636" offset="4848034">Indeed at this stage, I suppose it maybe more important that the Court face the issue and I couldn't deny that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.921" offset="4877187">The second consideration is that the determination of what case is to litigant – to litigate is an important part of the administration of the law and the administration of justice and under this statute as Justice Brennan suggested, there are alternative ways provided of going at the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.933" offset="4961197">We aren't directed to litigate every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.602" offset="4971959">We can't afford to litigate every case as big as the government is and it's important that the ones we litigate be those which we think are most suited for litigation in the sense that they will do most to promote universal compliance for the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.790" offset="5044684">Third, I confess I can't see anyway except by drawing a somewhat arbitrary line in terms of appropriateness for saying that this bill was correctly entertained by the District Court and entertaining any other bill by anybody else who says that the statute affects him or entertaining a similar bill by any [Inaudible] and challenging it on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.741" offset="5160459">Indeed, I don't know why it should stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.943" offset="5169236">Why shouldn't it be declaratory judgment actions to find out whether the Sherman Act applies to a particular set of facts and thus opening the door wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.603" offset="5219914">Now as I suggested a moment ago, Mr. Justice Black, those considerations apply to the general rule, to the -- they show I argue for the wrongness of what the District Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.306" offset="5290758">When the case is here, I should agree that the situation has very radically changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.492" offset="5319492">I don't think the argument I make applies with the same force to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.736" offset="5344465">I had only that I do what that rule – [Attempt to Laughter] I do ask this Court to disapprove that principle somewhat as you've indicated a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.116" offset="5385948">Now I'd like to go on to the merits of the case taking it that certainly they must be argued and submit that issue as I describe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.101" offset="5465883">On the merits, the only issue is the constitutionality of Section 201 as applied to restaurants selling food which has passed through the channels of Interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.790" offset="5536622">The appellees insist and we agree that Section 201 applies to its restaurant because the $70,000 sales of the Hormel's meat are a substantial part of the food that it served, and they have passed through Interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.598" offset="5615930">The only constitutional issue seriously pressed by the appellees if I understand their brief, is that Title II is not sustainable under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.389" offset="5659084">They do say a great deal about the Fifth Amendment Right freely to select ones customers, but then towards the end of that argument, they concede, if I understand them right, that the right is subject to restriction by legislation under the Commerce Clause and of course similar rights have been restricted by legislation under the Commerce Clause over and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.945" offset="5753334">In the Heart of Atlanta case, now I'm coming to the Commerce Clause, I developed or sought to develop both the general principle that we rely on and the fact sustaining the statute as applied to hotels and motels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.062" offset="5829716">The legal principle on which we rely here is the same one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.989" offset="5845494">The old and familiar rule that Congress may regulate activities which may seem local when separately considered if their regulation is an appropriate way of eliminating potential burdens or obstructions to Interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.770" offset="5912576">And the principle applies as their countless cases show to restaurants no less than other retail establishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.747" offset="5948521">To bring this case within that general principle, we rely upon the testimony before Congress to which I have referred earlier or to some of which I referred earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.415" offset="6007140">I'm not going to repeat the description of the general conditions which general business conditions, the decline of business conditions which were shown to result from racial segregation and discrimination and the resulting disputes and disturbances in various communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.665" offset="6096165">I refer to it that, it's just as applicable to this case, indeed more applicable to this case than it was to the previous one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.680" offset="6128243">Here, we say coming to restaurants more specifically, that the factual foundation for the congressional conclusion that racial discrimination in a restaurant like the McClung burdens and obstructs Interstate commerce is supported by two lines of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.497" offset="6215492">First, it results from the effective demonstrations against segregation, second, it results from the artificial narrowing of the consumer market by the refusal to sell a large class in many communities of perspective patronage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.736" offset="6284456">Whether -- where a restaurant serves food received from Interstate commerce either directly or indirectly, any dispute involving that establishment which causes it to close or which reduces its patronage necessarily diminishes its purchases and thus diminishes the flow of goods into the state to meets its demand.</text>

            <text syncTime="1603.515" offset="6519558">It's much as in the case of motion picture theaters in the Sherman Act or labor disputes at various restaurants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.309" offset="6554771">So I think the difference is in the theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.569" offset="6571803">I spoke earlier of the general effect of these disturbances upon business condition and the shipment of goods in other state -- from other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.892" offset="6613076">The general tendency of course, could be expected to apply to the particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.055" offset="6633765">Indeed since discrimination in place is a public accommodation is the focal point of most of the disturbances of what would expect the interference with commerce there to be the greatest or at least the Congress could so [Inaudible].</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.387" offset="6703042">This Court of course also knows something about the effect of segregation in restaurants upon their business and thus on the shipment of goods too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.665" offset="6748181">At least two of the sitting cases show that the restaurant was closed for a period after the demonstration took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.579" offset="6779842">During the 1963 demonstrations against restaurants and lunch counters, there were at least 14 states ranging from Florida to the Carolinas -- from California to the Carolinas and from Delaware to Florida in which there were disturbances at restaurants and lunch counters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.636" offset="6868031">Taking North Carolina alone, there were demonstrations in Chapel Hill, Done, Goreme involving 14,000 arrests, so one can imagine the effect upon the restaurants; Goldsboro, Greensboro, Williamstown, Wilmington, and Winston-Salem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.050" offset="6945667">The effect of the disturbance upon the restaurant and so upon its purchases would seem to me to be precisely analogous of the effect of the disturbance depending upon the labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.221" offset="7002405">It adds to that of course, the application of the commerce power as often been sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.927" offset="7029259">Now there's a second and still more direct link between racial discrimination in restaurants and Interstate commerce which is caused by the artificial narrowing of the consumer market resulting from the exclusion of bigger patronage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.693" offset="7096237">Artificial constriction of the market itself would result in a lessened volume of business, a lower volume of purchases or perhaps in additional restaurants not being started and thus would affect the flow of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.350" offset="7170947">Senator Magnuson on the floor of the Senate had summarized this point after he had heard the testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee of which he is chairman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.358" offset="7218908">If these establishments narrow their potential markets by artificially restricting their patrons to non-Negroes, the volume of sales therefore the volume of interstate purchases will be less although the demand maybe partly filled by other establishments that do not discriminate, the effect will be substantial where segregation is practiced on a large scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.586" offset="7307829">The economic impact is dealt into Interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.985" offset="7329458">The supporting evidence is referred to in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.426" offset="7351192">I'm not going to take time to summarize it but I do particularly want to call the Court's attention to page 70 where appendix -- page 70 Appendix B of the Atlanta brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.987" offset="7409497">For there, we have set forth in a table that you can study later, the evidence showing that apparently as a result of discrimination, the amount of expenditures by Southern Negroes in communities where segregation is practiced, is much less per capita, even after adjustments are made for differences in income, that is true in the areas where segregation is less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.744" offset="7540527">Now as I understand it, the appellees argument is considerably different from the argument that was made in the Atlanta case or perhaps because they have a restaurant to deal with rather than a motel, but I take it that they say essentially this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.458" offset="7631329">That the power of Congress to regulate local activities affecting commerce is not as broad as the power to regulate commerce, but is confined to the regulation of activity that do, in fact, create burdens or obstructions whereas you could regulate commerce itself for any reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.150" offset="7734147">But you come to regulate the activities affecting commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.501" offset="7747522">It must be for the purpose of fostering or promoting it and they say you can't regulate a man in all his activities just because he has received goods in commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="1931.361" offset="7830905">I'm willing to accept his argument up to that point if I understand it right, arguendo for the purposes of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.456" offset="7863296">We have suggested in our brief in a footnote that parts of it are inconsistent with the United States to get Sullivan and the Mandel case, but I don't intend to dwell on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.861" offset="7908958">And up to this point, really, we marched along hand in hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.152" offset="7938111">Then the appellee's argument, as I go on, says that the present statute was not conceived as a measurement, we're dealing with burdens and obstructions to Interstate commerce, but rather it's an effort to solve what was considered to be a social problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.574" offset="8011776">That is the appellees say, that it's shown the appellee is saying by the absence of any formal recitals which they have said distinguishes the National Labor Relations Act or the Fair Labor Standards Act and the agricultural legislation, and also by from -- by the absence of any provision for a specific finding in every specific case as to the effect of the discrimination on the Interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.277" offset="8122640">Then they apparently go on and assert that to the extent that the statute declares there is an interrelationship between discrimination in commerce, but that's a arbitrary presumption, invalid because contrary to common experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.565" offset="8199754">Now let me if I may deal with the last point first to work backwards in a sense because I think the whole argument unravels when you note the last point particularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.406" offset="8251163">And I call the Court's attention because I want to deal with this very precisely to the bottom of page 20 of the appellee's mimeograph brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.984" offset="8293481">There they say, we've been unable to find in the legislative history, that Congress gave any consideration whatever to or even had any testimony bearing upon an affect on commerce being generated by a restaurant serving in food which has moved in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.463" offset="8379372">In the last sentence, aside from that however, it is clear that the mere fact standing alone, mere fact standing alone, that a restaurant serves food which has at some time in the past across the state line, would not in every case, necessarily justify the conclusion that its racial policy would have an actual effect on commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.454" offset="8483339">Now there are two faults in that argument which seem to me really runs through the entire brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.486" offset="8515417">The first is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.321" offset="8526807">There is no requirement that it'd be shown that the activities that Congress regulates under the Commerce Clause would, in every case, necessarily affect interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.418" offset="8583127">As Chief Justice Marshall held back in McClung – Maryland, the word necessary doesn't mean absolutely essential, a compelled relationship in every instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.619" offset="8632028">It means not indispensable, appropriate, useful, incidental,and adapt into the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.605" offset="8667972">And Congress certainly could reach those local activities which are a more or less constant practice and create as Chief Justice Taft said in Stanford and Wallace a threat of injury to commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.521" offset="8719590">He said there, whatever is a more or less constant practice that creates a threat of injury to commerce is within the power of Congress to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.847" offset="8756893">In the Labor Board cases, Chief Justice Hughes pointed out simply to the evidence that refusals to bargain and discrimination were a prolific source of labor disputes affecting interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.213" offset="8810392">And of course, it doesn't have to be shown in the Safety Appliance Act that the omission of a safety appliance from every car moving in intrastate commerce would necessarily affect interstate commerce or in that the issuance of a forged warehouse receipt would in every case necessarily affect interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.149" offset="8906105">We're dealing with practical things here with tendency, with likelihoods, with risks, and that's what all the Commerce Clause cases dealing with affecting commerce that dealt with for many, many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.963" offset="8961380">Now the second fault in the sentence at the bottom of page 20, in appellee's brief, exemplifies what I think is another error that runs through the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.814" offset="9000772">It attempts to focus attention simply upon the past movement of the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.028" offset="9033582">It says we must look at that standing alone and the fact that goods have in the past moved across state lines, doesn't show that racial segregation in the future affect commerce, but of course, that isn't what Congress was concerned with and the statute makes this quite plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.031" offset="9113621">Indeed the statute doesn't even speak in the past tense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.570" offset="9127832">It speaks of someone who serves or offers to serve which has both, but it gets the current serves or offers to serve and why is that important because the fact that a substantial portion that the food -- of the food that he serves or offers to serve has moved in interstate commerce indicates that if nothing happens to his business, there is every probability that in the future, he will continue to acquire a substantial portion of his good from out of state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2318.026" offset="9377563">It could because here you see, Congress has not, as it might have done, so I don't argue, justify the statute, it might, I think, have reached everyone on the theory that the general effect of business conditions that I've described was enough, but it went farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.511" offset="9439525">It's said we don't want to go that far in the local affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.310" offset="9450705">We got to require an addition that each particular establishment have some link to commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.855" offset="9480903">But what I'm -- the point I'm pressing is that the past, the fact that the goods have come in from out of state is important with respect to what is likely to happen in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.607" offset="9547881">Well that is its irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.115" offset="9553941">The Congress was concerned or certainly could have been concerned on the basis of the testimony with the effect of racial segregation now upon the future movement of goods in interstate commerce and it's the threatened disruption of that future movement that the statute is reasonably adopted to protecting, preventing future disruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.174" offset="9654252">Now the appellee's answer to this apparently is, “well Congress didn't say so.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.396" offset="9679120">There are no express findings that it was concerned with the effect of the future movement of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.814" offset="9708795">We have two answers, both we think independently sufficient to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.036" offset="9733664">In the first place, we think that Congress did putting effectively, indicate that it was concerned with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.251" offset="9766474">It found in Section 201 (c) that the operations of an establishment affect commerce within the meaning of this Title if it serves or offers to serve the food that we have referred to, but what is the operations of the restaurant affect commerce mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.588" offset="9835855">I take it that that needs all its operations, including who it chooses to serve food to it or who it doesn't choose to serve food to and it says that that part of the operations like the others affect commerce where this has to take place or at least I submit that they had some entirely reasonable reading and the statute should be read, of course, to put its best life for constitutional purposes rather than its words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.428" offset="9947241">Now second, we say that the finding is quite unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.263" offset="9966572">The Court spoke upon this very point in the Carolene Products case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.123" offset="9986007">I won't -- I've quoted it in my brief, but it said very clearly that there was even in the absence of findings supporting the legislative judgment that the Court would presume the existence of those facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2860.018" offset="11545621">Now the other argument, or sub argument, that goes with appellees' point is that here the statute provides for no specific factual inquiries that the discrimination in this restaurant affects or it is likely to affect the movement of goods in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.522" offset="11631616">But there's nothing novel in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.113" offset="11645932">Congress over and over again has made determinations for itself in the Darby Lumber case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.705" offset="11676338">Mr. Chief Justice Stone pointed this out and said that sometimes Congress provides for an inquiry by the administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.122" offset="11706013">Sometimes it provides for the inquiry by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.432" offset="11723254">Sometimes it makes its own determination and that where it makes its own determination, the only question going back to the passage Mr. Justice Black was pointing to this morning is whether the end is within the power of Congress and whether this is a means of reasonably adapted to achieving that end.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.121" offset="11809980">Now as a matter of fact, what is done in this statute is identical with what was done in the Fair Labor Standards Act at the very argument that was made here was pressed in the Fair Labor Standards Act and rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.680" offset="11872256">Congress determined for itself in the Fair Labor Standards Act that the payment of substandard goods -- wages in establishments producing goods for interstate commerce did tend to burden and obstruct commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.621" offset="11948012">And it left open for judicial inquiry only the question whether the particular establishment produced goods for interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.295" offset="11990643">And so here, commerce determined for itself that the practice of segregation in restaurants that depend on interstate commerce for their purchases which is the affect of the past motive will tend to burden and obstruct commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.305" offset="12058771">It left open for judicial inquiry the question whether they do depend on commerce for their purchase so that the parallel I submit is complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.578" offset="12099835">As a matter of fact, the practice under the National Labor Relations Act is exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.023" offset="12133585">The National Labor Relations Board never inquires whether a particular discriminatory discharge or a particular refusal to bargain may burden or obstruct interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.883" offset="12189069">It inquires as we all know, of what is the volume of goods of that establishment ships out of the State or imports into the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.286" offset="12226686">And if the necessary volume is made out, then the Board takes jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.301" offset="12250718">Indeed the Reliance Fuel case decided here two terms ago, reversed a rule against the Second Circuit which it set the case back to the Board to find out whether the unfair labor practices in the particular establishment affected commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.803" offset="12316756">And said it was enough to prove that that establishment had a substantial inflow of goods, that was a retail establishment like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.389" offset="12347058">Whether the Board does have to -- or because it takes Congress in effect decided the question of the effect of the unfair labor practices called Labor Relations in the particular establishment or whether it does, it is a matter of its own laying down a general rule really is immaterial because if the Board can do it, then so can the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.453" offset="12443293">And in this connection, I should perhaps say, of course it's immaterial whether if all the other restaurants of Birmingham conform to the requirements of the statute that nonconformance by this particular restaurant would not be very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.611" offset="12519989">That point is resolved over and over again in cases under the -- by really everyone of these statutes including Wickard and Filburn, United States and Darby, and the cases that are dealing with the National Labor Relations Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3152.634" offset="12716012">Congress also said, not only, it not also had this evidence of general conditions in front of it, but it had evidence that this particular establishment made its own individual contribution to the flow of goods in commerce so that this particular establishment is tied to its trickle of goods that will be coming in in the future, trickle that would be enlarged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.769" offset="12844534">The effect might be enlarged and Congress could find would be enlarged, if the effect of artificially narrowing the market were removed at a trickle which might be damned up and stopped the movement of the flow of goods if a dispute occurred as a result of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.774" offset="12900645">And I think, Mr. Justice, I rely on the general condition for choosing, one to make the obvious point that was made in the Reliance Fuel case that this trickle is representative of thousands, hundreds of thousands of similar trickles and that together they are a great stream, a national economic problem as witness has testified before the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.553" offset="12995731">And second, that the general description shows that these trickles and these disputes are not unrelated among themselves and I think Congress was entitled to take that into account in judging its action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3333.557" offset="13439708">What we do contend is that this Act by use of the means that there was employed and by the breadth of the Act has brought within the scope of coverage restaurants over which Congress does not have any demonstrated or demonstrable authority under the Commerce Clause and it must therefore, be held unconstitutional certainly as applied to these appellees whose factual situation in and of itself shows a typical example of a restaurant that it cannot constitutionally apply to.</text>

            <text syncTime="3821.559" offset="15391786">We know that this Act embraces not just the Commerce Clause, but the Fourteenth Amendment to the extent that it refers in Section 201 (2) (d) to state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.126" offset="15434000">It's rather unusual to have a Commerce Clause statute combine with a -- a statute under another section of the constitutional act of Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.885" offset="15473079">And it makes it even more difficult to say that Congress made the specific finding or determination that Your Honor just suggested because to the extent that they apply the statute to these restaurants that are in those sense using interstate food but they have state action in some way involved, certainly the finding doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.845" offset="15556880">We think that what they did was find two separate lines of authority and they've -- legislative history is replete with evidence of this.</text>

            <text syncTime="6431.748" offset="25832511">We do not have a great deal of time left on the point but may I -- in conclusion, call attention to facts that relate particularly to the procedural aspects of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6443.150" offset="25878069">There was never any question that the appellees were covered by the Act, at least their complaint undertook to show that and certainly by the time of the hearing, this was shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="6456.019" offset="25929582">It has never been contended they are not covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6458.905" offset="25941076">In fact, it has been stipulated that they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="6462.411" offset="25955182">So they were in a violation of a statute which had immediate application to them, perhaps not immediate penalty but it had an immediate application.</text>
            <text syncTime="6471.430" offset="25991231">Two days earlier, the Department of Justice had filed a suit in the same court against 15 restaurants in one case, lumping them all together and asking for a joint trial as to all of them on this matter of no additional expense that has been suggested by the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="6489.625" offset="26063956">We think that this suggests a reason why the remedy afforded under the Act would not be as efficient and as convenient as the one that was available to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="6504.581" offset="26123829">Now as far as precedent is concerned for the injunctive feature in the case of Stafford versus Wallace which has been relied on by the Solicitor General in his brief and may I believe, it was mentioned this morning those are federal statute to regulate stockyards and there is hearing provided before the Secretary of Commerce or Agriculture, excuse me, Secretary of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="6531.458" offset="26231349">Whatever he rule was -- could be appealed to the Court of Appeals for review and there was no penalty just as the case in this statute, there was no penalty until after you have failed to comply with the Secretary of Agriculture's ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="6546.258" offset="26290490">I think the case was very close to the present case and the injunction was held proper by this Court via, Wickard versus Filburn, of course as already been mentioned there is authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="6556.084" offset="26329883">Most of the cases relied upon by the Solicitor General in his brief, but not this morning where cases dealing with the time honored rule that Federal Courts generally just do not interfere with the administration of justice in State Courts unless absolutely necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6572.001" offset="26393517">That point, we do not make any -- raise any question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6578.125" offset="26417967">That is the only explanation we know about the City of Gwinnett case which is cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6592.023" offset="26473556">May it please the Court, we would like to close our presentation of this case with -- by simply reminding the Court that we are dealing here not with any effort to restrict Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce or local matters that truly affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6616.719" offset="26572403">But if Federal system is to be maintained, then Congress cannot have under the commerce powers broad discretion as states have under the police power and we don't believe that historical precedents show that they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="6639.745" offset="26664459">Now, we do not urge any restriction of any of any line of authority that exists today, but it's just plain, I'm sure to every justice on this Court, that this does represent an area for which there is no immediate authority and for which there is no really close analogy.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="6940.019" offset="27865569">Mr. Chief Justice, it's late now.</text>
            <text syncTime="6943.347" offset="27878944">I'll try to confine myself in clarifying the client, fairly two points that Mr. Justice Harlan raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="6950.619" offset="27907992">First, so far as the matters of pleadings go, we of course, have no objection to Mr. Smith's pleadings being treated as if he were asking for a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6963.775" offset="27960655">The point of my acquiescence in the suggestion stops there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6968.759" offset="27980508">I don't think it essentially changes the case, but I don't mean to stand on any point of pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="6975.569" offset="28007780">Now with respect to our view on the effect of the demonstrations of the kind that took place in Birmingham, being directed against racial segregation in places of public accommodation of all kinds, our view with respect to that as I tried to state it and now I'm trying to be accurate again is it would be quite possible for us to argue and we do argue to the extent that it's necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="7013.438" offset="28159290">We certainly don't abandon the argument that as racial segregation in places of public accommodation generally, causes disturbances, demonstrations that interfere with the course of retail business generally and so lessen the flow of goods into the State and as previously shown before Congress did happen, that is sufficient to justify prohibiting discrimination in all such places under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="7052.803" offset="28316756">Now I say that I don't stand on that, meaning only that that isn't the whole of my argument that I don't have to ask the Court to go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="7063.135" offset="28358029">I don't mean that I abandon the argument or that I hesitate to make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7067.149" offset="28374121">I don't think I have to go that far in this case because the Congress apparently concluded itself not to rely upon -- not to reach that broadly.</text>
            <text syncTime="7080.136" offset="28426052">I don't know why, but it concluded that, so far as this case and this type of case goes where we're not involving discrimination supported by a state action, that it would make this applicable only to all the restaurants which are serving food received in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="7101.535" offset="28511629">And there, there is another individual link of which we think is on the precedents in effect conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="7112.478" offset="28555411">We think its importance is to be appraised not in terms of the individual restaurant or the likelihood of a dispute of that individual restaurant, but rather of the tendency at all restaurants of this kind which of course this the effect in Wickard and Filburn, the effect in Reliance Fuel, and all the others and we see no reason to suppose that Congress wasn't mindful of that and took the cumulative effect in the view.</text>
            <text syncTime="7139.864" offset="28664916">Now I would like in this connection to emphasize one distinction which occur one point which of course its the appellees interest to fuzz over a bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7150.961" offset="28709324">I don't think it is fair to say that Section 201 (c) (2) makes the Act applicable to every restaurant that ever has received some food from out of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="7167.357" offset="28774944">That would be a quite different case at least in respect to what I stated second was the -- the second thrust, the second point if I may of the thrust to my argument because here it speaks in terms of serves or offers to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="7182.475" offset="28835443">I presume that, that means something continuing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7187.701" offset="28856341">And while it is true in the case of Virginia hams like a Fine Wine Seller, I suppose things there maybe held and served over a period of time, that's the Freak case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7199.165" offset="28902212">Now the average case, of course would be of the 90% of the cases where if you are serving food, a substantial portion of which comes from out of state, this is a practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="7210.357" offset="28946934">You're doing it and there's a general turnover and the Freak case, Congress would certainly be entitled to take into account under the Penumbra doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="7221.346" offset="28990924">It's up to it to draw -- to draw a line because we must remember here that Congress does have the power under the [Inaudible] purchase of Purity Extract &amp; Tonic against Lynch and the other cases dealing with the transportation of intoxicating liquors to consider the interrelationship between these businesses and to draw the line so that it is not unfair to those who are closer to Congress to let the other ones go.</text>
            <text syncTime="7249.011" offset="29101579">I don't think I need to stand on any such thing but again I don't abandon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7253.972" offset="29121432">I might suggest one final and general word here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7261.426" offset="29151212">A good deal has been said about if Congress can do this then it can do that, if Congress could do that, then it can do -- go further and this may swallow up on the distinction between the nation and the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="7277.972" offset="29217354">Of course, what has to be drawn here is a practical line and a line which the cases make clear is for Congress to draw and the only question here is the burden isn't on us to prove the relationship between these practices in interstate commerce even if we hadn't said -- hadn't a word of evidence of that kind as Mr. Justice Black has suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="7302.325" offset="29314843">Still, unless the Court could conclude that there was no rational relationship that the Congress could find but then the congressional judgment would be conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="7312.482" offset="29355385">And we simply go forward to show that there was plenty of evidence of things that the Congress could take into account in addition to what they know of their own knowledge not to the exclusion of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7325.255" offset="29406480">This wasn't a matter of a record.</text>
            <text syncTime="7327.045" offset="29413690">We'll take this that Congressman knew out of their own experience were relevant for them to take into account here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7333.563" offset="29439708">Where there is that rational basis, then as it's so often the case, of course, the place to which the people must look to draw the line, to preserve a difference between what is local and what is national, is to the wisdom and discretion of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="7356.791" offset="29532704">Mr. Chief Justice Marshall pointed this out in the Gibbons and Ogden and referring to the Congressman said that they are the restraints on which the people must often rely solely as in all representative governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="7371.976" offset="29593412">Here, we think that connection existed that we have clearly shown that there's something which Congress could, indeed I think must rationally rely on as a national commercial problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="7384.448" offset="29643254">And once that appears and the legislation is shown to be reasonably adapted to solving that problem, then the question of what action shall be taken or not be taken as far as the Congress, that is the place where people must look for the final decision under those circumstances.</text>
