            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Number 443, Hughes Tool Company et al., Petitioner, versus Trans World Airlines Incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.517" offset="42005">Mr. Davis.</text>

            <label>Mr. Chester C. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="12.180" offset="48692">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.030" offset="64052">I'm Chester Davis, counsel of the Hughes Tool Company and I've lived three-and-a-half years with this case now and I cannot tell you how much I appreciate this opportunity to address to Court with respect to the issue which it involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.239" offset="132911">Number 443 and 501 which is on the counter nearly following this one are really companion cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.973" offset="167811">It's only from certiorari granted to the Second Circuit, 443 involved the compliant, 501 involved the counterclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.411" offset="213577">The issue in 443 is whether the District Court had a jurisdiction under the antitrust laws, there were no diversity of citizenship, that's the only basis for jurisdiction, of a complaint by TWA against its 78% stockholder, the Hughes Tool Company, the complaint which was filed by a new lender controlled management who had acquired control of TWA by insisting upon a voting trust as a condition to making certain senior financing available to TWA in 1960 for the purpose of financing some jet aircraft and who insisted about a 22% premium as a condition to a repayment of those advances.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.198" offset="444709">And that is -- that involved the issues in 501.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.464" offset="469786">Now, in order to appreciate the legal questions which are here involve, I think it would be helpful to the Court if I would take a little time to describe the origin of this -- of relationship between Toolco, Hughes Tool Company, we refer in the record as Toolco and TWA.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.533" offset="550034">In 1944 the CAB under the Federal Aviation Act, better known as Civil Aeronautics Act, review the origin of the interest of the Hughes or Mr. Hughes in a Hughes Tool Company and TWA and found that that because as a result of invitation by the then president TWA, Frey inviting Mr. Hughes to develop an interest in the airline which has been unquestionably a sick airline.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.434" offset="673646">And Mr. Hughes develop an interest in the development of the Constellation aircraft by Lockheed and as a result of that, I'm referring to now what the CAB found in 1945, found that that since the Tool Company had placed the orders for these Lockheed Constellations for the benefit of TWA with the intent of assigning those aircraft of TWA, the Tool Company even though primarily engaged in providing drilling press to the oil business was to be regarded as a person engaged in the phase of aeronautics within the meaning of Section 408 and as a “dealer” in aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.007" offset="836023">And therefore had a public hearing under 408 to determine whether or not that relationship, at that time, the Tool Company had approximately 45% of the outstanding capital stock of TWA and therefore was a controlling stockholder of TWA, whether or not that relationship was permissible under the standards of Federal Aviation Act pursuant to 408.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.585" offset="934243">It held hearings and it concluded in that it was in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.337" offset="957336">In so doing, it said, I'm referring now to what appeared in 68 (b) at 156, it's also referred to in the footnote of our main brief at page 13, that the obvious if not the expressed purpose of these arrangements was to give TWA the benefit of the credit and financial standing of Hughes Tool any transaction involving substantial financial responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.147" offset="1052526">At that time, however, the CAB was aware of the duty that the Congress have placed upon it and to reconcile the public interest involved by antitrust laws and the public interest involved under the Federal Aviation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.933" offset="1115638">We were all aware of the fact that prior to 1934, there was, if I may describe, the scandalous situation in existence where aircraft manufacturers were in control of commercial airlines, and in the Air Mail Act of 1934, there was flat provision against it, the continuation of that relationship between an aircraft manufacturer supply of aircraft in an airline.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.412" offset="1221590">Following the recommendation of Federal Aviation Commission, the Congress the adopted the regulatory approach and passed Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, the Federal Aviation Act of 1950 are identical for the purposes of consideration here.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.188" offset="1288673">Namely, to place the control relationship of a person engaged in the phase of aeronautics with an airline under the regulatory regime of the CAB and if approved by the CAB, the exemptions of 414 are triggered in those exempts the person who is subject to a CAB order from all of the antitrust laws or any other law applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.704" offset="1390759">Now, in view of that responsibility and based upon the recommendation of Department of Justice and the public counsel in 1945, what the CAB did was to impose a condition upon that relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.384" offset="1449482">It prohibited any transaction in excess of $200 between the Tool Company and TWA without obtaining further CAB approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.449" offset="1485740">That was the way in which CAB intended it to regulate and control the relationship created between someone it's found to be engaged in the phase of aeronautics and the airline.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.271" offset="1537045">It is not disputed that each and every subsequent transaction between the Tool Company and TWA, rendering financial assistance of providing or furnishing aircraft was submitted to CAB and was specifically approved by the CAB under Section 408.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.339" offset="1613322">In 1947, after some of -- business -- the business was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.537" offset="1634116">TWA was in need of additional funds and the Tool Company provided it with it a loan of $10 million with an agreement that it was to have a majority of the board of TWA, and also which provided that additional acquisition of equipment by TWA was to be approved by the Hughes Tool Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.933" offset="1735680">They want to control the condition of making this $10 million available.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.383" offset="1753443">The $10 million loan was also convertible and if converted, it would have given Tool Company in excess of 70% of the outstanding stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.872" offset="1787402">The CAB, on its own initiative, started another set of hearings in 1950 by reason of what they referred to this further control relationship between the Hughes Tool Company and TWA.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.445" offset="1853753">At that time, both public counsel contended and the examiner held that it would -- it would be necessary to review the entire relationship, the matter in which assistance have theretofore being given and the way to describe in all aspect of matters relating to financing, management, related activities and particularly with the respect to equipment acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.331" offset="1961273">The examiner stated in effect this requires an examination of the activities of the controlling corporation with respect to TWA for the period during which the prior approved control existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.341" offset="2017280">It also justified having another public hearing on the ground that that under this new agreement, a control relationship has been established with the control company, that is TWA, which formally responded to orders from one person with the assistance from others by proxy having only 45% of the outstanding stock, now responds or may respond to one person at its sole instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.572" offset="2122188">The result of that hearing after a finding by the CAB that TWA occupied a very important place of this country's domestic and international air transportation system, I might point out at this point that shortly after they approved the regional relationship situation to CAB did immediately thereafter grants some additional routes in TWA including some international route, making it for the first time a competitive Pan-Am because it was in the public interest to develop a competitive Pan-Am, Pan-Am to the contrary, notwithstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.667" offset="2258651">And therefore, the CAB after making those findings concluded that it was in a public interest to permit this further control relationship to be created and established.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.404" offset="2309538">Following that, the Tool Company from time to time furnished assistance to TWA in various ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.238" offset="2352901">Our brief describes these various transactional orders as I call them, they are about 18 in number and which cover each and every time that Tool Company gave any assistance to TWA by way of financing or by way of aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.486" offset="2429910">The aircraft that were furnished to TWA through the Tool Company were acquired from four of the five supplies of aircraft to air carriers in the first war period namely, Lockheed, Boeing, Martin, Convair.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.970" offset="2483827">In many instances, Toolco supplied financial assistance to enable TWA to acquire aircraft from others, this hold from the orders, number 22, these transactional orders reveal that.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.678" offset="2530638">And from time to time, the Tool Company furnished further assistance by giving -- by providing equity or by guarantying obligations of TWA.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.090" offset="2584346">Now, these transactional orders do reveal the facts and circumstances as to why it was necessary for the Tool Company some time to place the order for TWA than assign the contracts for provider's assistance, most of the time it was because of the stranglehold the Equitable Life Insurance Company had over the airlines with respect to loans and financing, versus you find in one of the -- one I‘d have to pick out page 23 in my brief of these transactional orders which provide that it is impossible for TWA acquire aircraft without obtaining prior consents or waivers under various financial arrangements it has entered into in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.130" offset="2752470">In other words, the Equitable had provided some funds or through the use of negative covenants and other restrictive provisions, it was necessary in fact for TWA to go and obtain consent with respect to anything that they wanted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.678" offset="2802625">And there is no question that during that period time, a certain amount of friction developed between these lending institutions and the Tool Company which made reputed efforts to finance TWA, as I say in manners not approved by those lending institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.619" offset="2866469">Now, this situation continued until 1960, I may say the pride of that in 1956 again became apparent that TWA needed some funds with which to go into the jet program and look another $10 million which the CAB approved, was made available through TWA by the Tool Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.145" offset="2936477">At one point, the Tool Company contemplated itself going to the manufacture of jet aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.882" offset="2955494">As soon as they did that the CAB initiated on its own another hearing for the purpose of determining whether or not -- if the Tool Company did become a manufacturer of aircraft, whether or not another hearing could determine the public interest should not be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.605" offset="3018397">It so happened that the complaint itself recognized that the Tool Company did not pursue those plans and that investigation by CAB was abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.360" offset="3057371">In 1960, in order to obtain financing for badly needed jet aircraft by TWA, these lending institutions as referred to in the counterclaims in 501 got together and refused to provide that financing except on the condition that Tool Company placed in a voting trust, control -- to be controlled by them with 78% stock interest for TWA and which also provide that Tool Company could not repurchase the obligations of these insurance company to receive without paying the 22% premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.065" offset="3192163">So I don't suppose insurance company were really interested in getting their money back, they wish for something else, and today then, thereby acquired control, fully control of TWA at the end of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.044" offset="3248170">A few months later, this complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.487" offset="3261858">And this complaint charges a violation of the antitrust laws, Sherman-1, Sherman-2, Clayton-3, Clayton-7, all of them, on the ground that the Tool Company exercised its control over TWA with respect to the acquisition of aircraft and the financing of aircraft in violation of the antirust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.386" offset="3357466">At the same time, it is admitted that we did not violate the Federal Aviation Acts, that there were no transactions that were not approved by the CAB, and they would violate any CAB orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.221" offset="3400829">At times, see this memorandum reply to our reply brief, counsel for TWA appears to be saying that what they are claiming is violation of the antitrust laws not by their conduct in supplying aircraft but in preventing TWA from getting additional aircraft, the more aircraft which was needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.035" offset="3492049">Well, the complaint is obviously very well drawn, very artfully drawn by counsel extremely learned in the antitrust field, more so than I am certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.577" offset="3542204">But I suggest this, Your Honor, that no matter how you look at this complaint, there is one thing which is certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.341" offset="3569267">It is talking about the conduct to the Tool Company as a controlling stockholder of TWA exercising control over TWA to be sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.689" offset="3614720">And it relates to the manner in which TWA acquired aircraft from manufacturers either directly or through the Tool Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.996" offset="3651918">That's all they can be talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.325" offset="3669264">In fact, I think that the most candid summarization of the complaint comes from counsel for TWA before -- when we went before the District Court in which he said, “The crux of such violations rest upon Toolco's acts and efforts through the exercise of the stock control over TWA, to control and dictate the manner and method by which TWA acquired aircraft, and the necessary financing therefore.”</text>
            <text syncTime="955.923" offset="3823595">And TWA's Chief Executive Officer on deposition described the compliant as being, “Based upon the fact that Mr. Hughes preempted to himself the procurement of planes and the financing of TWA's operations”.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.679" offset="3878661">He noted, the compliant does not charge any agreement or understanding between Toolco, any manufacturer of aircraft, or any other so-called supplier of aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.948" offset="3927771">It looks such contention has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.761" offset="3938952">There was a charge of a conspiracy with Atlas Corporation, would not name as a defendant name within the complaint, but that relates to an alleged effort to merge Northeast Airlines and TWA, which of course require CAB approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.850" offset="4003318">In fact, the agreements itself was subject to CAB approval as well as subject to the approval of the minority stockholders of TWA, by provision of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.951" offset="4039784">But the plaintiff claims that this was part of conspiracy to enlarge the equipment needs of TWA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.865" offset="4075416">I frankly -- I'm always get lost when I try to understand the just -- where is the area of antirust violation that this complaint is really talking about but I don't reach that point to answer the question that is posed because I am relying basically upon the supercession of the antitrust laws as reflected by the Federal Aviation Act when I have orders of the Board under Section 408, also under Section 409 which deals with any interlocking relationships between the person engaged in the phase of aeronautics and (Voice Overlap).</text>

            <text syncTime="1210.047" offset="4840176">I'm hopeful that I will be able to stop what I've been trying to stop for some time as I did unnecessary expenditure of time and money when we know because at some point, even for damages, you've got to show some proximate correlational relationship with that at some point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.029" offset="4912065">The facts have to come out that there is no basis for claiming a violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.165" offset="4932650">The problem we've had today has been, we have a complaint which said we violated the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.809" offset="4955220">And the problem which has been in the fallacy and the problem which we find running through CAB brief for example, amicus is, well, we never approved any boycotts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.618" offset="4998374">We never approved any tie end.Of course, we did, nobody asked them to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.858" offset="5015406">But the thing which conferred jurisdiction upon the Court, I submit, is not the use of evidence, but is by the description of a conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.902" offset="5051559">It's -- the CAB has jurisdictional of a conduct and I think the problem that has or the confusion that developed has been on the one hand saying, “Well, this complaint adequately complies with the notice pleading requirements that alleges a violation of the antitrust laws”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.989" offset="5115925">And the problem of when we our concerned with jurisdiction and that's the only basis for jurisdiction of discovering in the complaint a description of a conduct which it proved could constitute a violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.272" offset="5177051">Otherwise, I submit that the concept of primary or exclusive jurisdiction of an agency over the Court is at the mercy of the skill of the -- of the plaintiff.</text>

            <text syncTime="1360.506" offset="5441933">But, in one way you can reach that question, Your Honor, I mean that would be, that if you were to conclude that there was an affirmative duty on the part of the District Court to make adequate inquiries of the plaintiff, or if you please follow the recommendation of daily ranking with the Special Master whose recommendation was rejected by the District Court of finding out the basis for the allegations of the complaint which support the contention that the antitrust laws were violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.432" offset="5553633">Because -- I mean, perhaps, I should explain how this so-called order of default came about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.632" offset="5582472">Immediately following the filling of the complaint, I filed a motion to dismiss before I answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.193" offset="5612669">The District Court took the position and advised me in open court that based upon the decisions of the Circuit and decisions of this Court, it was very difficult to dismiss a compliant which on the face of the alleged violation of the antitrust laws and therefore suggest I hold it in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.514" offset="5674005">I had obtained priority and discovery on the basis that the defendants are entitled to find out what the complaint is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.004" offset="5699918">So, I said that I thought I could establish during the discovery of TWA, for TWA, for them, I would be able to establish that there was no basis for contending a violation of the antitrust law and so I proceeded on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.580" offset="5762299">It came a time however, when I found through discovery and through documents that were produced to me from these lending institutions that part of their -- of their technique would go on, to insist upon the digging of deposition of Mr. Hughes in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.981" offset="5811827">That it was going to be an extended one, it was going to be a burdensome one, it was going to be an expensive one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.063" offset="5832202">Complaint had been filed in the field and other things have been going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.796" offset="5847144">There came a time particularly after I found that TWA disclaimed any knowledge of any facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.502" offset="5865953">They were in the hands of counsel, and counsel had the attorney-client privilege and work product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.289" offset="5885074">And pursuant to the recommendation Mr. Rankin, I filed for a Rule 16 proceeding, I also submitted a number of detailed interrogatories to compel a disclosure of facts of conduct as distinguished on conclusions and pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.942" offset="5951739">At the same time, this Court came down with the Panagra decision, I see that I only have five minutes left Your Honor, and I'd like to save my time for rebuttal, but just let me say very quickly that the time came after the court denied by motion to dismiss, refused to submit the manner to -- for interlocutory appeal, refused to certify it, I came to the conclusion, I did it, if I was wrong -- I'm sorry, but I did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.859" offset="6039406">I came to the conclusion that my client was better off by resting on the merits of this position, than to undertake the burden expense of the kind of discovery that they were contemplating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.998" offset="6095935">Therefore, I rest on my position, the Court invited sanctions under 37, use of 37 language, calling it a willful default, and at that time did grant me a certification, and the Court of Appeals' limited review on the matter as I have indicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1601.500" offset="6405956">Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan, but I have one preliminary point which will suggest and I will come to it right now that perhaps this Court should not even reach the questions presented in the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.483" offset="6457887">I propose to cover four points may it please the Court, my first, is that the writ of certiorari should be dismissed as improvidently granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.438" offset="6501669">The reason for that is that the questions, upon which certiorari was granted need not be answered because of judgment below was clearly correct on another ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.561" offset="6554227">The second point which I propose to cover is that although the question is not really before this Court, the compliant that does in fact state causes of action under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.517" offset="6585992">The complaint is adequate on its face, the limited discovery which the defendants have permitted to occur to date indicates has a substantial basis in fact for the TWA claims and that what the defendants are really trying to do is to get partial or get summary judgment now on the basis of an incomplete record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.813" offset="6707200">The third point is that the Civil Aeronautics Board does not have exclusive primary jurisdiction of the matters alleged in the compliant, and the fourth point is that the CAB did not exempt in the reach of the antitrust laws, any of the conduct alleged in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.039" offset="6788075">As to the last two points, of course Your Honors have seen the briefs concluding the excellent belief that briefs submitted on behalf of the Civil Aeronautics Board which covers the last two points, primary jurisdiction point and the exemption point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.073" offset="6856202">Should I not be able to reach those points on oral argument, I would not want it inferred by this Court that I have decided to doubt, but that the Government was correct in its brief anymore than I have any doubt that TWA was correct in its brief on those points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.113" offset="6928405">We think the Government brief in concluding that CAB does not have exclusive primary jurisdiction and in concluding that CAB orders did not exempt the matters alleged in the compliant was correct and is correct and we thoroughly agree with that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.170" offset="7004578">But on examination of the record of this rather bitterly contested litigation over the past three years in preparation for this argument, it seemed to me that the first question stabbed me in the face and I have a duty to raise it with the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1879.147" offset="7516578">And I might say clearly correct on the ground stated in a decision and clearly correct for another reason which I now come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.817" offset="7555239">The District Court had before the complaint obviously sufficient on its face at least, to invoke substantially the jurisdiction of the District Court under the antitrust laws to adjudicate the matters alleged in that complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.432" offset="7629636">The District Court in a very casually considered opinion following extensive argument and briefing, reached the conclusion that that complaint was sufficient as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.114" offset="7680418">That decision was not then reviewable, law was review had of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.217" offset="7708839">Subsequently, and I might say that District Judge Metzner who had been appointed under our local Rule 2 as the judge for all purposes with this big case and who has administering this thing very effectively, that have been very bitterly litigated for well over a year until the defendants saw fit to default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.950" offset="7795775">Judge Metzner having decided that the compliant stated causes of action under the antitrust laws and administering the pretrial discovery and deposition proceedings, having appointed former Solicitor General Lee Rankin as a Special Master, the supervisor, depositions on a day-to-day basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.352" offset="7881352">Judge Metzner and Special Master, I should put it the other way around, Special Master and Judge Metzner, finally got to the point after the defendants have had on trial on discovery for well over a year, of ordering some three types of discovery for TWA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.021" offset="7960033">Your Honors will hear the companion case that those orders extended also to the benefit of the so-called additional defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.121" offset="7996395">I will not go into them in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.338" offset="8005277">I need not for my purpose, Judge Bromley, will cover that matter thoroughly in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.381" offset="8025443">But what the judge decided finally after all this litigation, was that there were two categories of documents that TWA clearly had the right to have under the appropriate discovery rules and in light of the allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.762" offset="8130978">And the District Court held and directed, as you will hear a number of times, that the defendants produce certain financial and tax information of the Hughes Tool Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.357" offset="8185417">That information was available, it could have been produced, it was not produced, and that was one event of default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.196" offset="8228780">The second event of default related to the refusal of the defendants to produce what they've describe in the Court of Appeals I think is a big batch of documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.815" offset="8291161">These were documents as to which they had unsuccessfully asserted, the attorney-client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.837" offset="8323344">On this point, I think it's important that Your Honors realize as this record shows that Hughes Tool Company employed attorneys as business negotiators, as businessman to negotiate deals, and financing, and plane acquisitions and things of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.756" offset="8395024">In any event, after thorough argument, thorough consideration, thorough briefing, the court below held that these documents whatever privilege had attached to them before will no longer privilege and the court directed that the Tool Company produce those documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.762" offset="8474958">This big batch of documents were available, they were there, they could have been produced, they weren't produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.123" offset="8508395">They were obviously of the most significant type of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.846" offset="8531383">That was the second event of default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.422" offset="8545593">Now, the third and most egregious of the three had to do with the court's order that the Tool Company produce how in Hughes, it's sole stockholder and managing agent for a deposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.644" offset="8614557">That history of how that order finally came to be entered, I neither try take your time on now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.427" offset="8645695">But there was an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.879" offset="8655412">The order was explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.922" offset="8663667">The deposition Hughes was set for Los Angeles and the fact is that on the Friday before the Monday, when we were all packing to go out there, having lawyers and clerks, and having offices and files and so on, the counsel for the Tool Company filed what he called a notice of position which Your Honors will find in the record which said in effect, we're not going to do anything further about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.569" offset="8774217">We're not going to participate many more discovery, we stand on the merits of our position to date and we're just not going to participate and we're aware that this deprives us of right to litigate further except insofar as we get appellant relief to litigate further on the merits of this matter except as to the amount of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.722" offset="8862824">Well, that led to the intrigue, led to the Commission of the third default, counsel for the Tool Company described that default indeed all of these defaults as a business decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.600" offset="8930325">Your Honors will find in the record in this notice of position a statement that they calculated that the damages that TWA would recover although admittedly TWA has been damaged at least 45 million dollars, at least 45 million admittedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.342" offset="9009319">As Your Honors will come to see in more detail later, they calculated that the damages which TWA would recover in the default hearing were less than the expenses in taking Hughes' deposition that was the alleged reason why they made the business decision to default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.071" offset="9076193">Now, quite naturally, I was concerned, less there would be some contention made that for some reason, Mr. Hughes couldn't testify and quite naturally, District Judge Metzner was concerned and quite naturally, the Court of Appeals was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.461" offset="9157799">And when there are some reference was made by counsel for the Tool Company in the Court of Appeals argument on November 13, 1963 to the possibility that perhaps Mr. Hughes was an eccentric and maybe he didn't like to be bothered with these kind of things and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.161" offset="9248601">I felt obliged to and I did report to the Court of Appeals a conference in chambers with Judge Metzner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.151" offset="9280575">With Your Honors permission, I would like to read what I then said to the Court of Appeals which was and is the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.931" offset="9319654">I said to the Court of Appeals as follows and I read from page 122, Your Honors, of the transcript of that argument which is not in the printed record before you.</text>
