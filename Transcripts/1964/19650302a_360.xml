            <text syncTime="10.466" offset="41796">Mr. Carter, you may proceed and continue with your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_c_carter_jr" startTime="16.321" stopTime="496.312">
            <label>Mr. Joseph C. Carter, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="16.321" offset="65202">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.600" offset="82338">On yesterday prior to the recess, the issues in this case had been stated and the statement of facts had been substantially completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.214" offset="124761">I had just apprised the Court of the facts concerning a special session of the General Assembly of Virginia held in November of 1963 which enacted certain revisions of the election laws so as to make them workable in the practice with the total tax requirement for registration and voting inoperative in federal elections as required by the Twenty-fourth Amendment but operative in state and local elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.587" offset="270315">The only one of these statutory revisions that was held invalid by the court below and the only one which is the subject of this appeal is Section 24-17. 2 to which I referred yesterday which establishes two optional methods by which a registered voter in years subsequent to the year in which he registered must prove his revenues as a qualification for voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.531" offset="414093">The Twenty-fourth Amendment having been formally ratified in January of 1964, the statutes involved here became effective by their terms on February 19, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.675" offset="482638">Two declaratory judgment actions and these cases were instituted by the appellees on the very next day, February 20, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.116" offset="524434">And the order of the court below was entered on May the 29th.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.207" offset="544810">A stay was refused by this Court in June of 1964 and consequently the final order of the Court went into effect on July 1 of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.691" offset="602697">When you look at the opinion of the court below in this case, you will see that in the very first sentence, that court concluded that the statute involved here created a new and additional substantive qualification for voting in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.348" offset="705306">A qualification which the Court said was demanded of federal voters only and not of state voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.751" offset="742922">Thus, the reason of the Court, this qualification is invalid under Article I, Section 2 and the Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.794" offset="791092">This initial conclusion at the very start of the opinion is the cornerstone of the entire reasoning of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.144" offset="828500">And we believed that it is plainly and fundamentally erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.733" offset="850860">It's quite clear we believe that Article I, Section 2 and the Seventeenth Amendment contemplate that the people of the states must first establish qualifications for voting in their state constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.007" offset="919928">Which qualifications are then adopted by those two sections of the United States Constitution and are thereby made qualifications for voting in federal and congressional elections as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.581" offset="982309">This Court and numerous other authorities have repeatedly observed that it is the people of the state who first fixed or established the qualifications for voting that apply in federal and state elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.058" offset="1052212">Now going back into history, all of the states in this nation at one time or another have had qualifications based on qualifications for voting, based on age, or residents, or sex, or race, or property ownership, payment of taxes, literacy, and other similar qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.866" offset="1139461">But of course the power to fix or establish these qualifications as vested in the people of the states by Article I, Section 2 and the Seventeenth Amendment has now been expressly and specifically limited by the Fifteenth, the Nineteenth, and the Twenty-fourth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.648" offset="1230576">Those amendments are couched in very similar language and in the same basic form although the last one, the Twenty-fourth Amendment, is the only one that applies to specified federal elections only.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.838" offset="1295256">The other two apply to all elections held in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.801" offset="1323154">Now each of these amendments rendered inoperative a particular type of qualification for voting that many states had theretofore had in their own constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.397" offset="1381564">But none we submit has fundamentally altered the basic plan whereby it is the people of the states who first fixed the qualifications for voting and those qualifications are then adapted by the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.140" offset="1456483">The power to fix or established voting qualifications has also been limited at least to the extent of procedural and implementation statutes by the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.057" offset="1528163">But subject only to the limitations of these four amendments to which I have referred, the people of the states have the power to initiate voting qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.418" offset="1581662">Now, it is important to remember that the state courts very early in our history proclaimed the fundamental constitutional nature of voting qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.200" offset="1636728">And the Supreme Court of Virginia like the highest courts of most of our states has adopted the rule that substantive qualifications for voting must originate in the Constitution of Virginia and cannot be created or rescinded by mere legislative enactments of our general assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.877" offset="1731500">This rule has been enunciated in three different Virginia cases which are cited on page 13 of our opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.848" offset="1763370">So, if the statute involved here Section 24-17.2 created a qualification as the court below reasoned then this statute would be invalid under the Constitution of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.179" offset="1844663">We believe and we argued to the court below that this was basically a question of state law as to whether or not such a qualification was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.377" offset="1885414">And it was on that basis that we moved for abstention in this case, feeling that surely in the area of voting qualifications there was one field left where the federal courts might properly divert it to the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.224" offset="1956885">But of course this motion was overruled by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.430" offset="1977678">Turning now to the Constitution --</text>

            <text syncTime="813.702" offset="3254753">Now, as I pointed out yesterday because of the system of permanent registration in Virginia, the payment of the poll tax has had a very practical significance in the working of the election machinery.</text>

            <text syncTime="2128.270" offset="8512993">It was residence and poll tax, not residence or poll tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.609" offset="8534413">The Attorney General, when the legislature met the special session to pass this legislation stated that the right of the state to fix qualifications for voting is not changed in any other respect.</text>

            <text syncTime="2222.619" offset="8890410">The argument that it was a proof of residence came later in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2262.435" offset="9049652">And the Governor laid it back to the constitutional convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.623" offset="9066475">He said accordingly and out of the genius of that body of men originated our present system whereby it is presumed that any person assessed for the computation tax and thereby allege to be a resident of Virginia who comes forward and voluntarily pays the assessments six months prior to a general election shall be presumed to be a resident of Virginia and shall be deemed to have satisfied those provisions of the constitution which restrict voting to residents.</text>

            <text syncTime="4537.385" offset="18149460">And I might say on this issue at least insofar as the Twenty-fourth Amendment is concerned, the state has a very heavy burden because they are putting a burden on the exercise of the Twenty-fourth Amendment right and they have the job of justifying that this is a reasonable burden and they can -- if they cannot justify it this is a reasonable burden unless they can show that the poll tax in fact and as a matter of legislative intent was a residence requirement which I think it was not.</text>

            <text syncTime="4587.480" offset="18349871">Until November of 1963 no one has ever dreamed that the poll tax was a requirement, was a proof of residence, it was always something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4597.228" offset="18388846">It was an -- means of raising revenue or as the Supreme Court of Virginia has pointed out, it was a means of restricting the electorate to those persons who are sufficiently interested in governmental affairs to pay their poll tax at an early time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.506" offset="18449972">Now in fact, it does not -- the poll tax does not really prove residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.825" offset="18495216">It -- the check on residence might be necessary with respect to two classes basically, the persons who are coming into the state for the first time and people who have been within the state, have registered, have voted, and that since moved out and would still like to vote again.</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.959" offset="18567732">As to the first class, people who have never been then tried to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.497" offset="18581943">The real proof of residence, the real check on residence is the registration requirements because that's the first thing you have to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.925" offset="18615693">This legislation recognizes that registration is the real check on residence as to those people because you do not have to obtain the certificate in the year in which you register.</text>

            <text syncTime="5072.641" offset="20290560">On page 10 of the record in Subparagraph B of this Section before you, it says it would be notarized or witnessed by at least one adult.</text>
            <text syncTime="5081.490" offset="20325878">So one witness only is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.772" offset="20339043">Now, as to the equal protection argument that's been made here, I challenge anyone to look at the statute in question and tell that it classified federal voters and state voters in terms it speaks of every person, any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.200" offset="20408738">So it does not make the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.164" offset="20420650">Now we did say in our reply brief that even conceding that it made a classification of federal voters, that classification would be invalid under the rule of Pope versus Williams, a Maryland case which was cited and relied on very heavily by this Court only yesterday in the case of Carrington versus Rash.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.061" offset="20504242">And we believe that under the language of both of those cases, this particular provision of Virginia Code would be valid as a classification even if it did -- even if it were limited to federal voters only which is not --</text>

            <text syncTime="5146.063" offset="20584176">That is quite correct and many of the enactments of the General Assembly in 1963 were classificate -- bringing into law the classifications of the Twenty-fourth Amendment made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.426" offset="20629629">Now, in answer to the contention made by the Government, the questions of Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice White got right at the heart of their contention because if you read their brief, you will see that what they are saying is that anything which is burdensome, onerous, harsh, oppressive, and which would force you to pay the poll tax would be invalid under the Twenty-fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5183.754" offset="20734955">We would concede that if it had the effect of forcing you to pay the poll tax and was so unreasonable and so arbitrary that it did that then it would be invalid under that amendment but here --</text>

            <text syncTime="5210.166" offset="20840594">Now pushing the Government's argument to its fullest extent, let us supposed that Virginia did a way with the poll tax and in place of it adopted an annual registration system which many states have.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.874" offset="20895451">And let's say that they declared in making that constitutional amendment that they were doing it as a substitute for the poll tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.966" offset="20923768">Now would that be invalid?</text>
            <text syncTime="5233.165" offset="20932650">We contend that it clearly would not be and that the Government's argument falls apart completely and when it's viewed in that light.</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.272" offset="20965042">In conclusion, I would like to say just a word about the abridgement argument which was brought up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5248.816" offset="20995239">It's our contention that if you look at the legislative history of this particular amendment, you will see that it was a specific and pinpointed as any amendment to this constitution has ever been.</text>
            <text syncTime="5261.455" offset="21045812">Senator Harlan introduced the resolution in about five sessions of Congress and he spoke at -- on it at every bar association and other meeting he held during that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.447" offset="21089698">And he said repeatedly that the only objective was to do a way with the price on the vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.459" offset="21117806">And that he did not intend his resolution to upset the state election machinery anymore than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5286.366" offset="21145391">So we contend that the word abridged in this context and with this legislative history means to deprive or to cut off or to curtail by doing something else that is so harsh and so oppressive that it has the tendency to make people pay the poll tax and thereby violates the amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="5331.735" offset="21326890">All of us have speculated as if this law had been in effect for sometime and then we did have some practical experience under it.</text>
