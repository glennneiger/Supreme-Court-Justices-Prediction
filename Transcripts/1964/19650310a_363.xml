            <text syncTime="3755.425" offset="15021662">And that's the whole question involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.991" offset="15031902">And as I started out with, Your Honor, I started out with -- with the complexity as to why this case is here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3766.361" offset="15065443">I must say that I came here quite and full with argument and to make one of those real -- I think telling speeches and the Court so well understood the problem that I had very little to say as if I answered the questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3824.982" offset="15299918">Alright, I will eliminate it from you, sir, any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.300" offset="15317159">But this Court has said many times in all kinds of cases and particularly in these -- this type of case that everybody is entitled to their day in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.058" offset="15368150">And that the basic philosophy of this whole thing of the wife's rights not being wiped out by ex parte proceedings was solely that she wouldn't become a public charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.225" offset="15416842">Now, what I'm saying here and what I am asking this Court to do is not to allow a -- somebody come in 10 years later and present a defense, they may have had in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3871.730" offset="15486851">I don't think that the Court would have the right to do that, any court would.I think that basic premise has been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.487" offset="15517884">What I'd say is that when the parties have had their day in Court and they have fully litigated an issue that one of the parties should not be entitled to run to another jurisdiction and in an ex parte proceeding which is another effect of fraud upon the Florida Court in this case wipe out this woman's rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="3905.805" offset="15623210">And wiped out this woman's rights and then say when she comes in to assert her rights, under this decree that she got when both she and her husband had their day in Court, they say on a procedural technicality, well it's too late to present that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.126" offset="15684441">You should have presented it years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.269" offset="15696980">I'd say that's not only not granting full faith and credit to the New York decree, that's depriving this woman of her equal protection under the law and due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.413" offset="15741597">They litigated this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.911" offset="15751628">They litigated it together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.347" offset="15757375">They had the day in Court and for him to go off now in another jurisdiction on an ex parte proceedings and wiped out her rights, I say cannot be done under the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3950.039" offset="15800111">And that's why I say that this New York decree should be granted full faith and credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.993" offset="15819964">The Florida Court should be required to say, “Yes, that issue was litigated, did New York decree is res judicata and she is entitled to enforce this property right because marital status has nothing to do with it now because the man is dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.681" offset="15878687">She's enforcing this property right in his estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.134" offset="15896451">And I believe that it should be enforced else she's been deprived of her constitutional rights.</text>
