            <label>Mr. Louis H. Pollak</label>
            <text syncTime="27.598" offset="110341">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.731" offset="126851">This case arises out of the Freedom Rights of May 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.651" offset="150570">The case comes to this Court on certiorari to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals of Alabama, a judgment which affirmed convictions of the 11 petitioners involved in this case, 11 convictions rendered by the Montgomery Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.816" offset="231236">Ten of the 11 petitioners were convicted both of breach of peace and of unlawful assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.917" offset="263628">The eleventh, a Reverend Wyatt Walker was found guilty only of the latter account of unlawful assembly, but all eleven received the same sentence, 30 days in jail and $100 fine which sentences of course are in suspension pending review here.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.545" offset="334158">Now, if it please the Court, the alleged breach of peace consisted and I refer here to the Solicitor's complaint on the basis of which these cases were tried in the Circuit Court consisted in the petitioner's sitting down as a “racially mixed group” at a lunch counter in the Trailway's bus terminal in Montgomery at a time in May of 1961 when Montgomery was under a state of limited Martial Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.685" offset="466651">Reverend Walker was charged only -- was convicted only of unlawful assembly, not of the breach of the peace itself because he was not one of those who actually sat at the counter, he merely was alleged to have conspired with the others to sit at the counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.934" offset="531644">Now, if the Court please, as I shall try to demonstrate --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="137.090" offset="548258">What do you mean Mr. Pollak with limited Martial Law, by formal declaration, is that it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_h_pollak" startTime="141.261" stopTime="320.425">
            <label>Mr. Louis H. Pollak</label>
            <text syncTime="141.261" offset="564976">Yes -- no, the record doesn't disclose this Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.924" offset="583680">The declaration was, if my recollection is right, by the Governor and what it meant for the time period involved which was made 21st through 25th was that the City of Montgomery was in -- for law enforcement purposes controlled by the Montgomery National Guard under the command of General Graham, the Commander of the Guard of whom we will hear more in a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.601" offset="694335">It was -- I say limited Martial Law, in the sense that, as you will also see the civil officials were still operating under military direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.165" offset="732578">Now, petitioners submit that a review of these facts, which I'm about to narrate, will show that the instant convictions are vulnerable on almost more federal constitutional and statutory basis than I can account as denial of equal protection of the law in the broader sense and that these prosecutions were plainly designed to enforce racial segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.711" offset="858802">As denial of free speech in the sense that, the act of these petitioners in sitting as a racially mixed group at a lunch counter was for them a symbolic utterance of their commitment to desegregation, but they were denied procedural due process in the basic Thompson versus Louisville or vagueness senses in that nothing they did could be equated by any conventional standard with a breach of the peace or if it is then -- if it is under Alabama Law, breach of the peace to sit at a lunch counter then that is a statute which does not give warning of its meaning and that all of the petitioners were denied rights under the -- which have been declared by this Court in Boynton versus Virginia, statutory rights under the Motor Carriers Act declared by this Court in Boynton versus Virginia just five months before this episode arose, the scene of this episode being an Interstate Bus Terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.112" offset="1120444">Now, this of course requires and what I intend to devote most of my time to a recital of the facts because if I may refer to a question which Mr. Justice Stewart put to Mr. Greenberg at the beginning of the Hamm argument he said there could be a real case of unlawful assembly, could there not and Mr. Greenberg said, indeed there could be a situation in which people would vigorously assert their rights to the, extent of throwing sugar balls.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.473" offset="1249802">I intend to show, I think I can I satisfy this Court, this is not in any sense a sugar ball throwing case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="320.425" stopTime="340.535">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="320.425" offset="1281672">There is still another argument of course that so far as the Civil Rights Act goes, the new Federal Civil Rights Act goes, you're only invited to ask for service if you think you're entitled to it under the Act and then if you're asked to leave, you're obligated to leave and because then you're only right is to bring a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.103" offset="1356382">Do you understand that argument?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_h_pollak" startTime="340.535" stopTime="349.863">
            <label>Mr. Louis H. Pollak</label>
            <text syncTime="340.535" offset="1362129">I do Mr. Justice and I should hasten to say at this point that in the catalog of federal questions I have recited, you'll note that I did not include the new Federal Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.976" offset="1395879">I don't reject the Act --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="349.863" stopTime="351.923">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="349.863" offset="1399432">That was the subject to my question to Mr. Greenberg.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_h_pollak" startTime="351.923" stopTime="604.334">
            <label>Mr. Louis H. Pollak</label>
            <text syncTime="351.923" offset="1407687">I fully realize that but I thought I had to carry over to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.894" offset="1423569">I don't mean to say that I reject the Federal Civil Rights Act and Mr. Greenberg's argument for this purpose, but it's a -- I think indeed I suppose I could -- petitioners could claim a sort of innocence by association with the contention to which Mr. Greenberg and Senator Motley have made.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.343" offset="1485322">But the federal questions which have been in this case from the beginning at every level of the proceedings I think are sufficient to our purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.193" offset="1524715">On May 20, as this Court may remember as well all remember just as citizens, the first group of May 20 of 1961', the first group of freedom riders came to Montgomery.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.444" offset="1565675">They were met by violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.527" offset="1586051">On May 21, the following day which was a Sunday, late in that day, Montgomery was placed under the Martial Law which I have described as I say I think by governor's determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.774" offset="1639027">At all events, it meant that General Graham was in command of the city for the next four days at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.251" offset="1660970">Meanwhile, the violent events of May 20th were widely disseminated throughout the nation by television and newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.549" offset="1694093">Among those -- some of these events I meant most, were read most deeply was one of the one of the petitioners today, John Maguire, a professor of religion at Wesleyan University.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.624" offset="1758459">Professor Maguire had been born in Montgomery.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.482" offset="1781864">He telephoned a friend, Reverend William S. Coffin Jr., at the Chaplain of Yale University, and suffice it to say that they talked the matter over and within the next 48 hours they decided that they would go to Montgomery which they did in company with three others, Professor Gaylord Noyce, of the Yale Divinity School; Professor David Swift, Chairman of the Wesleyan Department of Religion; George Smith, then a law student at Yale Law School and now a member of the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.898" offset="1931494">Of the four -- out of the five, Smith was a Negro, the other four were white, They left New Haven on Tuesday, May 23rd, traveled to Atlanta, stayed overnight there, and went by bus on Wednesday the 24th, the day before their arrest to Montgomery.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.846" offset="2007353">By now, their group had swollen to seven because in Atlanta, they encountered two Negro theological students, Clyde Porter and Joseph Charles Jones who accompanied them.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.399" offset="2049567">In Montgomery, they stayed overnight, the night of the 24th.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.544" offset="2074122">On the morning of the 25th and this brings us to the events which are decisive, on the morning of the 25th, they determined that they would go on from Montgomery to Jackson, Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.826" offset="2127203">Now, they decided this in the light of the fact that the previous day, two bus loads, two prior bus loads of freedom riders had left from Montgomery and had gone to the Jackson and indeed have been arrested and the arrest in Jackson were the first arrests -- well, none of them -- nobody had been arrested, no freedom riders have been arrested in Montgomery, but it was known that the groups which had left Montgomery were arrested in Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.315" offset="2229185">Suffice it to say these seven travelers decided to leave on Thursday morning for Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.928" offset="2267638">Pursuant to a request made by General Graham, who as I say was in command of the city at this time, pursuant to a request made by him that he be advised of any movement, the seven travelers telephoned his headquarters and said they would like to take the 11:30 or 12:00 bus to Jackson and would like to be -- if that was the wish of the military to be conveyed down at the Trailway's bus terminal and so, a military convoy came, before the seven, they were staying at the home of Reverend Abernathy, then a pastor in Montgomery.</text>

            <text syncTime="632.454" offset="2529802">I believe so and I'm sure it says so in the statutes of Alabama, if we can take notice of them but again we don't have this in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.815" offset="2579226">The military convoy of several cars took the seven would be travelers plus four companions, who are going down to the bus station to see them off down to the bus terminal, the Trailways bus terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.784" offset="2635128">The four companions were Reverend Abernathy, Reverend Walker whom I've mentioned as having been charged, convicted of only one of these offenses, Reverend Shuttlesworth, whom I think this Court will take judicial recollection of as a frequent recipient of the Court's hospitality, and Bernard Lee, all four Negro's.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.196" offset="2728751">The eleven were driven by military convoy to the bus terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.242" offset="2756963">Now, when they reached the bus terminal and I must call upon your sense of visualization here, the street on which the terminal faced was blocked off by the military, Lee Street. There were crowds estimated from 300 to 500 people beyond the troops which meant across the street from the bus terminal and at the ends of the street but some -- but troops, State National Guardsmen, who numbered at least a 100 on some of the estimates, General Graham's estimate went up to several hundred were disposed outside the terminal and between the terminal and the crowd.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.385" offset="2937522">The military convoy went, took the group of a 11 into a rear entrance, and off the street entrance to the bus terminal and they entered by that rear entrance at the point where they were in effect, guided to by the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.106" offset="3016411">They went into the only available entrance which was a rear entrance to that so-called “White waiting room”.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.031" offset="3044101">Now, that white waiting room -- let me put it this way, if the Court please, if I can – if in your mind you will imagine that you have no curtains or columns behind you and they entered a rear door somewhat behind where Mr. Justice White's seat would be and where -- that was where they were to come in at the guidance of the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.492" offset="3137933">Inside the waiting room was a lunch counter, at this point, I may use your bench as that lunch counter which was the extreme wall, a lunch counter which ran along this way and sort of curved around approximately where Mr. Louis is sitting and out there would be Lee Street with about -- windows about ten feet back of Mr. Louis but no window giving on to this extended lunch counter and back over there, somewhat to the rear of Mr. Justice Brennan was the ticket counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.319" offset="3301251">Now, I give all these details because this is the setting of our episode.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.411" offset="3321626">Within the white waiting room into which this racially mixed group were guided with the ticket counter and the white lunch counter and they were about 50 people, guardsmen, other local law enforcement officers including the sheriff, and travelers, and just hangers-on, and newspaper reporters.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.607" offset="3430400">The seven travelers bought their tickets and then the entire group or almost the entire group with the exception of Reverend Walker proceeded to come toward the lunch counter to sit down, but just before as they were just before this movement towards the counter, three white toughs as they were described by Colonel Porch, the Second Senior Guardsmen in Command.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.357" offset="3545339">Colonel Porch was in the room, General Graham, the Commanding General was in the room and Sheriff Butler, these were the senior law enforcement officers there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1023.548" offset="4094119">I think that is particularly appropriate observation Mr. Justice and what characterizes this situation as I'm just about to indicate is that there was never any request with which they were not in compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.147" offset="4160575">No warning that they did not heed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.996" offset="4171964">They were at all times in compliance with the indicated path of duty and the indicated geographic path until they were arrested with no warning as for example, by total contrast with Edward versus South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.137" offset="4244480">Now I was just about to say that just before the group sat down, there were three so-called white toughs as Colonel Porch identified the men who he said were in that room to make trouble, who started pouring coffee on the seats of the lunch counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.931" offset="4327654">How was this met?</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.316" offset="4337162">Colonel Porch went to the three, found out they weren't travelers and sent them out of the terminal then passing right by all of those law enforcement officers, the group of petitioners sat down at the lunch counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.247" offset="4408947">There is some inconclusive testimony that noise which in any event was high went higher outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.399" offset="4445518">There was also great doubt if the crowd could see at all into the terminal, though their testimony on that point is in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.409" offset="4477597">I would only say at this point that, the only people who testified us to visibility, who had actually looked from across the street into the terminal themselves to makes that attempt said one couldn't see, one couldn't tell, if one saw a person certainly what race he was but I would acknowledge that the testimony they have may be said to be in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.437" offset="4561711">At all events, in this situation of noise and confusions, perhaps -- but no -- no request not to sit down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.393" offset="4601522">The group of at least eight or nine, perhaps ten of the petitioners sat down at that counter, if I may say so, were served coffee and then Colonel Porch gave Sheriff Butler a signal and he went -- that signal was understood by the sheriff to be a signal to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.392" offset="4673515">And if you look at page 169 of the record, you will see a photograph as I, said there were news people in the room too, and there is a photograph of Sheriff Butler arresting the freedom riders and you can see he's going down the line of the petitioners that I said, its facing page 168, a not a very good replica of a not very good newspaper photograph but --</text>
