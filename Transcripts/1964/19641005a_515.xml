            <text syncTime="206.634" offset="932127">The Heart of Atlanta Motel Corporate is Georgia Corporation owned a motel in line of name, the Heart of Atlanta Motel.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.996" offset="977580">The motel has 216 rooms, it is located in downtown Atlanta and fronting on the Interstate Highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.704" offset="1008405">By stipulation, we agreed that over 75% of all the business, in the form of guests coming from out of the State of Georgia, than most of the convention business is listed out in the State of Georgia, there we have highway billboards on roads in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.816" offset="1092833">There was nothing in the stipulations about a restaurant because we brought the suit in the name of the corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.673" offset="1132225">The government in their counterclaim included the lessee but later dismissed them because they determined as a matter of fact, after the facets of the act, the lessee was complying with that.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.944" offset="1209339">Somewhat in part and end of the case because also the Alabama case far in this one, there is a arresting involved but not in this particular case, but the -- low applicable is interested in -- and applicable to us because eventually it will apply to our restaurant too even though it is a lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.550" offset="1275794">And I think those all are facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.328" offset="1282900">I think it comes squarely under the law, under the law as proposed by Congress, now, we have attempted to -- and have attacked the constitutionality of Title 2 of the Act, which is probably the accommodation section.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.714" offset="1348415">Although, our petition to make it perfectly clear, says that the Act itself, the whole Act will fall for the same reason we think Title 2 will fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.327" offset="1386867">Now Title 2 of the Public Accommodation section, it really got two parts in making a difference in this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.557" offset="1415811">The one that applies to motel just says, categorically that all motels and all hotels are picked in the state commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.719" offset="1444441">They do it in a devious way.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.975" offset="1449456">They say, that these establishments listed here and after which affect the interstate commerce are covered by this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.042" offset="1477773">And then on the second paragraph list motels as well as a lot of other things, and in this thing, at the end of our list and above paragraph therefore, affects interstate commerce and therefore is covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.459" offset="1523435">But in substance it says, every motel in the United States, all 65 of them, all affect interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.955" offset="1553424">The other part of the Act which I referred to a minute ago about a restaurant, says that any restaurant that serves or offers to serve food in Interstate travel, all who serves food to a substantial portion, which it had already moved interstate commerce is covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.411" offset="1619252">There is a distinction because the restaurant is a factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.736" offset="1640464">It's conceivable that you could find in favor of a restaurant in this case and against a motel but not vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.574" offset="1667840">Because I believe each restaurant will stand on the factual situation of that restaurant, whether it serves the interstate commerce travelers or where a substantial portion of food passes in commerce, as already passed in commerce which they use if those will stand up.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.459" offset="1735445">But as to a motel, the portion that we are primarily interested in is the portion that says that all motels regardless, our part of interstate commerce, all affect.</text>

            <text syncTime="542.303" offset="2274821">While the Act was biased, what the morals or the reasons of a legislative intents or purposes were as a matter for the people on the other side of the square across First Street and Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.247" offset="2394566">The fundamental question besides illegal question of a constitutionality there, the fundamental question I submit is whether or not Congress has the power to take away the live of an individual to run his business as he sees fit in the selection and choice of his customs.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.321" offset="2462798">This is the real and part of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.422" offset="2475233">And the fact of alleged civil rights of the Negroes involved is purely incidental, because if Congress can exercise these consultative of the right of individuals, it is possible that there's no limits to Congress' power to appropriate private property and living.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.303" offset="2550779">Theory number one, the Congress passed an Act in 1875, which is almost identical in Public Accomodation Section of this Act, and in 1883, Congress -- this Supreme Court, held that that Act was unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1787.166" offset="7254178">And there had been other cases which have held that if a person is forced to serve another in business ways that if that involves involuntary servitude prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment, I've cited cases in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.698" offset="7320320">Now I won't read it of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.496" offset="7327530">But all of these cases go to service contracts of one person, performance services in business for another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.451" offset="7363370">In our Fifth Circuit Court in 1944 held that even if that person was compensated for it, unless the compensation itself constituted a waiver of their objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.855" offset="7404957">That compensation itself involuntary servitude still violated the Thirteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.262" offset="7430661">Of course there are exceptions to it -- it has been held in this Court that involuntary servitude does not mean service in the armed forces although, (Inaudible) disagree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.971" offset="7473397">And they held that service of a term of -- penalty for a crime of course is not voluntary servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.954" offset="7505371">But there are eight cases cited here in the -- of the United States Supreme Court, that's a Fifth Circuit Court case and a Seventh Circuit Court case and a case in one of the State's Supreme Courts which have held at service of another, against his will in a business that constitutes involuntary servitude which prohibited on the Thirteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.517" offset="7607667">Now may it please the Court as to the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.871" offset="7645074">Mr. Justice Goldberg made probably the -- one of the most profound statements about the constitution that I've ever read in which I'm not sure that a whole lot of lawyers in this country would agree with me or even with the justices at this time but I think it's still true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.450" offset="7719366">In the Maryland case, to quote Mr. Justice Goldberg, “Our sworn duty could do construe the constitution requires however that we read it to effectuate the intent and purpose of the framers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.449" offset="7775373">Not the framers, as if they were sitting in this room that they passed any judgment on what the constitution is supposed to be, but what the framers intended the constitution to be at that time it happened in 1787.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.318" offset="7822811">If that theory is not so, then the constitution is just like any another law, it could be changed from day-to-day by the Congress and by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.748" offset="7860532">The difference between our government and any other government in this world is that we have a constitution that stays at a constitution in the words at its there, unless it is amended -- in a way the constitution provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.092" offset="7909956">Our Constitution is still the same constitution it was in 1787, except the amendments of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.204" offset="7938377">The people have decided should be added to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.417" offset="7959275">When this Constitution was adopted, the United States was broke.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.217" offset="7978397">We were in the middle of a depression as we know it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.928" offset="7993234">A financial chaos, the securities of this country were practically -- they were selling for 15 as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.924" offset="8025208">New York State and New Jersey State were fighting the trade war between each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.891" offset="8045166">The Potomac River out of here was the subject of dispute between Virginia and Pennsylvania and Maryland because of tax and restrictions placed on trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.591" offset="8087902">And the reasons of the Virginia assembly, called the -- the convention call it -- on at an utmost convention, was to talk about trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.900" offset="8125205">They went for five states there so as they said, “Let's go back and get everybody here and call the next one,” and said between 1787 which was the constitutional convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.260" offset="8158642">And the subject of that convention was some way to prop up the United States financially because trade between the states was not going well and that was the real chaos that we were having.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.534" offset="8207647">And there is the basis of that little old innocuous clause in the constitution which says that the Congress shall have power to regulate trade among the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.553" offset="8263758">The best analysis -- not in my opinion but of historian, the best analysis of the constitution and there are reasons puts adoption and the -- and why it was adopted, it's found in the federalist papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.966" offset="8321437">And in number 11, Alexander Hamilton defied commerce as the free circulation of commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.428" offset="8355291">And in number 42, James Madison, the other (Inaudible) stated a very material object of this file of commerce clause, was the relief of states which import and export throughout the states, from their proper contributions levied on them by the latter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.346" offset="8422896">Where these are limited to regulate the trade between state and state, it must be foreseen their way, would be bound to load the articles of import and export during the passage through their jurisdiction, with duties which would fall on the makers of the latter and consumers of the fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.460" offset="8495412">So what does that mean in our case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.708" offset="8504398">We say that the framers of the constitution intended to cover commerce as commerce is known in business fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.219" offset="8542433">And that it was intended to cover the transportation and movement and production of articles -- from agriculture, products of industry, methods of transportation, tariffs between states which we don't have now, thank goodness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.368" offset="8611082">And anything else that had to deal with commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.567" offset="8627801">But as the Birmingham Justice in this case recently said, Tennyson Brook -- unlike Tennyson Brook, commerce has got to come to an end somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.566" offset="8675866">And it end sooner or later interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.660" offset="8688196">It can't go on forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.994" offset="8697495">And commerce means as the framer of the constitution intended to mean, all of the thing they thought about at that time was actual goods in commerce and the transportation of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.375" offset="8743053">That is true, that Congress and decisions of the Supreme Court have enlarged the commerce power beyond which -- I submit the framer never intended, they never thought it would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.386" offset="8803135">And in this case, it is significant that the commerce power in the three big fields, the way they usually referred to, an antitrust and wage and hour label.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.705" offset="8852349">In all three of those fields, Congress setup some standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.841" offset="8868963">In any trust field, you've even got to be on in interstate commerce or material effective, but at least to the courts with determination or whether a particular business is in this interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.655" offset="8916193">They don't say Congress as a matter of fact can say if it's on a court that every business is subject to anti-trust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.429" offset="8947226">In the wage and hour field, no business is subject to interstate commerce generally speak and unless it has a certain volume of business and they even have two or three different standards of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.750" offset="8992575">But not every business is subject to wage and hour laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.403" offset="9003128">As a matter of fact, the motel and hotel industry specifically excluded from it at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.394" offset="9027161">And in the labor field, not until just very recently, in the -- in hotel employees case, when the Supreme Court said to the National Labor Relations Board, you cannot exclude as a class, all hotels and motels from your jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2870.289" offset="11586743">I wish to emphasize and we'll emphasize repeatedly in my argument, that Title II was addressed to a grave commercial problem, grave at the time the Act was enacted and plainly go through it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.808" offset="11648810">Nor should we forget, Mr. Justice Goldberg, that Congress in addressing itself to that commercial problem was also keeping faith with the promise declared by the Continental Congress that all men are created equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.255" offset="11710563">Now the failure to keep that promise lay heavy on the conscience of the entire nation, north as well as south, east as well as west.</text>

            <text syncTime="2924.547" offset="11803768">Nor do I overlook the need for a spirit of co-operations and mutual understanding in facing those difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.924" offset="11837309">We should solve the problems as one people and thus escape the consequences of the sins of the past, unless we act in the spirit of Lincoln second inaugural, without malice, with charity and perhaps above all without that spirit of false self-righteousness that enables them who are not themselves without fault, to point the finger at their fellows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.426" offset="11939291">Happily, the difficulty of the constitutional issues here is not equal to their importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.312" offset="11966772">Title II as we see it, rest upon the powers delegated to Congress by Article I, Section 8, Clause 13 of the Constitution -- Clause 3 of the Constitution, to regulate commerce among the several of states, and upon the power delegated by Clause 17 of the same article, to enact laws that are necessary and proper to effectuate the commerce power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.736" offset="12076486">The constitutionality of Title II under those provisions is sustained by principles that are so familiar because they have been enacted over and over again, applied indeed throughout our entire history, going back as Mr. Justice Black has pointed out a moment ago to the opinion of Chief Justice Marshall and given some argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.545" offset="12163735">We do not seek the extension of any existing principles here a fortiori, we invoke no new doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="3085.644" offset="12448157">The particular application to this set of facts and to practice of segregation is of course now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.458" offset="12483370">The Title II of the Act is printed in our brief in the Heart of Atlantic case, beginning at page 63 that I think it might be useful to go through the plan rather quickly in order to get oriented with respect to the particular provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.220" offset="12566439">Section 201, you will observe on page 63, declares the right of all persons to full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities and so forth, of any place of public accommodation as defined in this section, without discrimination by reason of race, color, religion or national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.564" offset="12667794">Now the term place of public accommodation is then defined in sub-section B of the character of places as listed, and those places are places of publication within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.556" offset="12735817">If one of two alternatives is satisfied, either if its operations affect commerce or if discrimination or segregation by it is supported by state action, then sub-section C and D define supported by a state action and affect commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.310" offset="12834769">The definition of supported by a state action is at the top of page 65, you will note that it follows essentially the language of the Civil Rights Act of 1871.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.078" offset="12881894">That section is not involved in either of these two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.874" offset="12905091">The government did not proceed in either case in the lower court and does not proceed here, on the theory that this discrimination is supported by a state action within the meaning of the statutory provision which may or may not be as broad as the meaning in state action under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.844" offset="12988891">We simply make no argument on that point because we think this application of the statute is clearly brought within the commerce provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="4056.981" offset="16333505">I would like and I think it'll be helpful in the long run if I may continue the exposition of the provisions of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.370" offset="16367046">I've noted already 201 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.178" offset="16386273">201 (e) simply provides an exemption for private clubs, and we need not concern with it or ourselves with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.450" offset="16423366">202 is another substantive provision which applies even to retail stores Mr. Justice Harlan in the unlikely event that segregation or discrimination in a retail store is required by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.901" offset="16493166">I know of none but that section -- I'm simply emphasizing is broader than the public accommodation section.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.267" offset="16526602">203 simply declares that no person shall violate the right to equal public accommodations, and that completes the substantive provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.221" offset="16586475">The procedural provisions become in part and in the next case and I'd like to revert them to them now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.386" offset="16623151">Section 204 authorizes a private suit for enforcement of the right to equal treatment in places of public accommodation but there are number of things that should be noted about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4143.453" offset="16679366">In the first place, any such private action must be referred to a state agency if there is a state agency empowered to prevent discrimination in such a place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.586" offset="16727954">And even if there is none, it may be stayed for reference to the Community Relation Service, an agency intended to -- by persuasion to induce voluntary compliance in the elimination of discrimination before it goes to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.992" offset="16793574">Furthermore, and this is most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.051" offset="16805799">You will note that the action that may be brought at the bottom of page 65 is a civil action for preventive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.843" offset="16844983">There is no right in any private person or anyone else to bring an action for damages and a fortiori, there is no provision for criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.658" offset="16888242">This is emphasized when one comes to Section 206 which authorizes the suit by the Attorney General which was instituted by a counterclaim in this heart of the claimant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.224" offset="16938501">For he has authorized when he finds a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of any of the right secured by this title, to bring a civil action requesting such preventive relief as he deems necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.286" offset="17002658">And the limitation of the statute to preventive relief is emphasized in Section 207 (a) over -- on 207 (b) over on page 69, which provides that the remedies provided in this title shall be the exclusive means of enforcing the rights based on this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.653" offset="17112163">The only question on the merits in either of these cases is the constitutionality of the substantive provisions of Title II particularly to those impinging first on inns, hotels, motels, like places offering accommodations to transient guest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.251" offset="17190531">And then second, those applicable to restaurants and other eating places which receive a substantial portion of the food served in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.155" offset="17234207">As I've said, we think that the constitutionality of both provisions rest squarely upon the commerce power aided by the necessary in profit clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.855" offset="17281019">But the major premise of our argument is the familiar role that the powers delegated to Congress by the commerce and necessary in profit clauses, authorized Congress to regulate local activities, at least activities that are local when separately considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.334" offset="17354893">Even though they are not themselves, intestate commerce, if they have such a clause in substantial relation to commerce that their regulation may be deemed appropriate or useful to foster or promote such commerce or to relive it of burdens and obstructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.065" offset="17445799">The minor premise of our argument is that Congress to which the economic question does raised is primarily committed at ample bases upon which defined that racial discrimination in inns, in the one case -- inns and motels in the one case, restaurants in the other, does in fact constitute a source of burden or obstruction to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.876" offset="17569097">And of course from those premises, the conclusion would follow that this is a legitimate exercise of power under the commerce clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="4407.636" offset="17736072">But I would say that the principle is that if the person challenging the act of Congress, can show that there is no rational basis for a practical factual conclusion that this thing that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.972" offset="17809424">I hear the prohibition of racial discrimination or segregation in certain places linked to commerce, that it had no tendency, could not reasonably be found to have a tendency to foster or promote commerce or to relieve it of burdens or obstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.790" offset="17876715">Then this Court should invalidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.848" offset="17884970">Now I don't think that it is simply a matter of looking at the record before Congress, unquiet the Tenth and do stand on the record made before Congress here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.937" offset="17925303">But I should point out that under many, many decisions, the question is simply whether the fact do exist -- or might exist and the presumption is that they do and there is no need for Congress or a state legislature to make any such record indeed that's been held with respect to both in case cited in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4477.743" offset="18016522">But here, the record was made and we do cited, and we think that these show that there was ample basis for concluding that this segregation in all these kinds of establishment did create -- was creating a grave national problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="5231.194" offset="21030322">Now, so far as what was the dominant motivation here goes, what was the constitutional theory on which the Congress or different congressmen acted goes, I suggest that that is irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="5434.087" offset="21841894">If there are alternative approaches to the problem, then it had to choose between them.</text>

            <text syncTime="5462.018" offset="21953593">Now here -- this was -- I'd like to emphasize and go into it in a little detail, a very real national commercial problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.470" offset="21995389">And the record shows that beyond the peradventure of a doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5476.554" offset="22011794">Let me talk about it first in somewhat general terms and then turn specifically to the motels and hotels that are involved here and thereafter specifically since we're looking at the act in general, the general plan of the Act and to the effect upon restaurants and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="5495.669" offset="22088281">I simply say parenthetically first that of course this general principle that Mr. Justice Clark referred to a moment ago, has been applied to the activities of hotels and motels, and restaurants under numerous statutes, the Sherman Act, to the laws administered by the Federal Trade Commission and the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5518.100" offset="22177933">Now, Congress started with the outstanding fact that I think that of National Life during the past decade perhaps longer, the thrust or the realization for Negroes and in some instances other minorities, of the promise that all men are created equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5537.824" offset="22256823">We're concerned here with the commercial consequences of which where a nationwide scope and almost incredible proportions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5547.361" offset="22294962">Not unnaturally, much of that pressure that I refer to, was settled on racial discrimination in places of public accommodation of practice that was not confined to any one section of the country or to any particular type of establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5565.492" offset="22367477">Congress heard evidence for example, in about two months in the spring and summer -- early summer of 1963, that there were 634 demonstrations in 174 cities and 32 states in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="5581.476" offset="22431425">About a third of those were concerned solely with discrimination in places of public accommodation, others had a broader scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="5590.489" offset="22467474">The effect of those demonstrations picketing, boycotts, other forms of protests, upon business conditions and therefore upon the interstate commerce was dramatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="5603.637" offset="22520137">The Undersecretary of Commerce described the business consequences in considerable detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="5610.001" offset="22545528">But for illustrative purposes, it's enough for me to take what happened in Birmingham in the spring of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="5617.882" offset="22577084">In a four-week period extending from the middle of April to the middle of May, department store sales is reported to the Federal Reserve Board were 15% below the level in 1952, in comparable cities, they were rising.</text>
            <text syncTime="5634.894" offset="22645107">Businessman stated that the number of business failures during that period was greater than in the Great Depression of the 1930s.</text>
            <text syncTime="5644.614" offset="22683977">Downtown stores reported that their April sales were off from 40% to 50% during the period of these demonstrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.366" offset="22723056">And the Undersecretary described in his testimony that similar experiences at other times in Savanna, Atlanta, Charlotte, North Carolina and Nashville, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5668.715" offset="22780421">Now it's evident that any general downturn in business -- in retail business will, if left unchecked, result in serious disruption of the flow of goods across state lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="5682.405" offset="22835174">If the retailers don't sell, they won't buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5685.456" offset="22847399">And if they won't buy of the demand for goods flowing in from other states, of course, will be checked, the flow of goods will be dammed up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5696.149" offset="22890135">A top retail executive epitomized the commercial aspects of these demonstrations very effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.506" offset="22923572">He said this thing has frightening ramifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="5707.751" offset="22936529">It's now become an economic situation affecting the entire community, the whole city and the whole country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5716.154" offset="22970175">I emphasize that he said it was an economic situation affecting the whole country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5723.206" offset="22998387">No less in pardon is the impact to racial discrimination, disputes and other forms of civil unrest, upon the flow of investment and the location of enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="5735.116" offset="23046034">The Secretary of Labor who had had a study made before testifying before Congress, summarized the results of the studies made by his department.</text>
            <text syncTime="5744.743" offset="23084486">Industry said, he's discouraged from locating or expanding in communities where equal opportunity does not exist and incidents have taken place are likely to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="5755.359" offset="23127014">Lack of equal facilities for employees and even the latent possibility of demonstrations often removes the locality from consideration as a site for commercial or industrial expansion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5767.486" offset="23175497">This affect industrial development regionally and nationally by limiting the flexibility and free choice of business and hampering labor mobility.</text>
            <text syncTime="5777.610" offset="23216039">The evidence before the Congressional Committees was replete with specific examples of that general statement by the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5787.148" offset="23254178">The most dramatic was the experience in Little Rock, Arkansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5791.744" offset="23272568">In the two years before the racial crisis in that city, Little Rock could gain ten new plants where it's almost $3.5 million and creating a thousand new jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5803.905" offset="23321156">In the next two years, a comparable period, there was no new industry located there employing more than 15 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5813.249" offset="23358563">Even industrial development in the whole state of Arkansas seems to have been affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="5818.849" offset="23380924">In the previous two years, they gain business worth $248 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="5825.816" offset="23408823">In the next two years, the volume was cut to $190 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="5832.709" offset="23436408">Now, I have no argument in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5835.941" offset="23449365">To argue that the general impact upon interstate commerce of such widespread disputes growing out of racial segregation is alone sufficient to support Title II.</text>
            <text syncTime="5847.571" offset="23495863">Because Title II does, as I pointed out earlier in my argument, also require with respect to each of the kinds of business regulated, some mixes between bank establishment in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5861.629" offset="23552078">What I do say with respect to this general evidence, is two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5869.488" offset="23583530">First that it shows that the general impact to these disturbances arising out of racial discrimination, was not merely social and morals, and nobody denies that aspect of it, but that it was national and commercial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5885.083" offset="23645910">And second, that the importance of the relationship between any individual establishment, and interstate commerce is made out in accordance with section 201 (c), is to be judged in the light of the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5898.895" offset="23701185">That any -- that its practices and any incidents that might occur there, would be part of a complex and interrelated problem affecting interstate commerce when they were added together all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5914.937" offset="23765342">I come now if I may to the specific problem of the relationship between discrimination in hotels and motels in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5925.164" offset="23806197">You'll recall at section 201 (b) and (c), provide that any hotel or motel or like establishment that accepts transient guest, shall be deemed to affect interstate commerce, and through that provision to be a place of public accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5942.961" offset="23877355">The appellant blindly falls in that category, it's not only concededly a motel, but 75% of its guest come from out of state and it advertises out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5956.076" offset="23929913">The testimony before Congress provided literally overwhelming evidence, that discrimination by hotels and motels impedes interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5968.376" offset="23979024">And I suggest that there is no possible doubt since the Edward's case or before the Edward's case that interstate travel by men and women is interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5981.176" offset="24030224">We've summarized the testimony in our brief, and I refer to it very shortly here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5987.953" offset="24057391">Again, the Secretary of -- Undersecretary of Commerce, dealt chiefly with the point, he can concluded after studied by the Department of Commerce, not only that interstate travel was made incredibly more difficult for Negroes by which -- by reason of discrimination in hotels or motels, but that its volume as a whole was sharply curtailed by the unavailability of adequate public accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6016.853" offset="24172957">The administrators of the Federal Aviation Agency testified to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6023.896" offset="24201169">The witnesses -- these witnesses and others, described the problem in some detail and you have the references from our brief. Suffice it to say because I think it epitomizes the point, that on a motor trip between Washington D.C. and Miami, Florida, the average distance that was found between accommodations of reasonable quality open to Negroes was 141 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.444" offset="24315376">And when we think of the frequency by such we go by other hotels and motels open to everyone, the significance of a three or four-hour drive between the hope of accommodation is very significant indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6068.556" offset="24379742">And it further repaired that those accommodations that were available to Negroes were on the whole likely to be small so that after driving three or four hours one might well find no vacancy sign, and have another equally lengthy drive ahead of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6086.295" offset="24450691">Similar -- I use this only as an illustration, I want to emphasize, similar problems according to the testimony exists in other parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="6097.497" offset="24495517">Segregation in hotels and motels has an even more dramatic effect upon the sites chosen for conventions but of course account for a large volume in interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6109.666" offset="24544209">Dallas, Texas for example, founded that -- could it benefited very much from the voluntary opening of its hotels to conventions where there was no segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6120.335" offset="24586945">At the Atlanta Convention Bureau, within one day after 14 Atlanta hotels desegregated, received commitments -- not fillers but commitments, from organizations expecting over 3000 delegates which would not have gone to Atlanta if segregation were continued to be practiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="6145.662" offset="24688196">Again, New Orleans found the -- an American Legion Convention expecting 50, 000 people transferred to another city because New Orleans could not guarantee equal public accommodations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6164.565" offset="24763846">Finally, this kind of restrain has a most marked effect upon the volume of interstate travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6174.053" offset="24801776">They won't do to say well –- well, people will go somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="6177.977" offset="24817450">In the first place, it seems to me that that's unlikely, but in the second place of course any practice that distorts the flow of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6185.899" offset="24849110">And it prevents it from going where flowing freely if Congress thinks it's desirable to flow freely, is itself a restraint on interstate commerce, and something within the power of the Congress to deal under the proposition that I stated earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="6299.595" offset="25303954">Simply to summarize on the factual point, we think there was ample evidence on which Congress could conclude that the racial practices in hotels and motels like places, did have a very substantial effect upon the movement of people in interstate commerce, and that therefore this statute has applied to them is a measure adapted to fraying interstate commerce from restraints and burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="6332.559" offset="25435820">Now of course once that conclusion is reached, at the size of the establishment is obviously irrelevant and of the Reliance Fuel case determined there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6349.796" offset="25504784">The fact that Congress has prohibited hotels and motels from discriminating against all guests, rather than against interstate guests, does not invalidate the statute to require a traveler to carry a cache, and show that he's interstate, would itself be a burden on Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="6371.897" offset="25593182">Furthermore, to require the Negro interstate traveler to prove that he was traveling in interstate commerce would itself be a form of discrimination of (Inaudible) as the former practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="6519.486" offset="26183549">And that proposition was re-enunciated in the Darby Lumber case for unanimous court by Mr. Chief Justice Stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="6528.997" offset="26221584">The argument that Congress violated the Fifth Amendment has equally little merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6534.389" offset="26243109">Certainly, there's no taking of property for a public use.</text>
            <text syncTime="6539.187" offset="26262335">The regulation of the conduct of a business is not a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="6543.654" offset="26280202">Appellant say that they will lose profits as a result of this regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6550.364" offset="26307056">Experience rather indicates the contrary, but assuming that that is true, and still it is clearly been held that subjecting a man to regulation, otherwise proper along with all other similar businesses does not violate the Fifth Amendment simply because he loses money.</text>
            <text syncTime="6570.149" offset="26386155">Nor does the prohibition of racial discrimination take liberty or property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6578.182" offset="26418338">Over and over again, the Court has sustained and enforced statutes prohibiting various forms of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6585.657" offset="26448222">The Bob-Lo Excursion case dealing with the excursion -- on the great lakes, on the case here involving continental airlines, and discrimination in the employment a few years ago, the Thompson case dealing with restaurants in the District of Colombia, the Blanton case dealing with restaurants that were part of the transportation service of a bus line and I could go on and add numerous others.</text>
            <text syncTime="6609.910" offset="26545189">Appellant also argues that the Act violates the Thirteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6614.481" offset="26563474">It's enough to point out that the appellant is a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6618.330" offset="26578834">But surely it would turn the world quite upside down for anyone to seriously suggest that the Thirteenth Amendment was intended to prohibit either Congress or the state governments from guaranteeing Negroes equality of treatment in places of public accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6636.888" offset="26653126">And Alice I think, even at the end of her long journey through the looking glass, would have been surprised to be told that the restaurants, other places of public accommodation in 33 states in the year 1964, held in involuntary servitude, and that the Anglo-American common law for centuries has subjected to slavery, innkeepers, hack man, carriers, (Inaudible), furriers, all kinds of other people, holding themselves out to serve the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="6675.980" offset="26809443">Normally do to say that well, those are businesses affected with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6682.089" offset="26833894">Because the Thirteenth Amendment abolishes slavery in businesses affected with the public interest, just as might, just anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="6690.424" offset="26867226">Of course the real answer is, that this appellant, even if it were a person could stop holding himself out as a motel willing to do business with the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="6704.004" offset="26921561">And as long as one is free to stop, then, there is no forced labor and no violation of the Thirteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6713.486" offset="26959491">Now the point -- remaining point concerns the Civil Rights cases of 1882.</text>
            <text syncTime="6722.108" offset="26993972">As I have argued, this legislation as applied in this case is valid under the commerce clause, then the standing of that decision is not drawn in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6735.514" offset="27047575">The Court made it clear that the Act of 1875 was drawn in another view.</text>
            <text syncTime="6744.026" offset="27081639">And I take it the respect in which it was drawn in another view, was that it covered a great many enterprises -- theaters, local public conveyances, which on any facts before the Court or any facts known to Congress, probably did not then affect interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6764.303" offset="27162723">In other words, the statute was framed in another view in this instead it was much broader.</text>

            <text syncTime="6829.481" offset="27423530">What I'm saying is, if that statute covered a great many things that were not shown anywhere to affect commerce, and that the Court therefore had to consider perhaps two question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6841.979" offset="27473476">One, whether the statute was valid in the broader applications which was presented in the 1882 case, and then later it had to consider which was presented in the Butts case.</text>

            <text syncTime="6877.562" offset="27615791">Well, there's a curious little quirk about then.</text>
            <text syncTime="6881.807" offset="27632823">The facts appeared to be these.</text>
            <text syncTime="6887.154" offset="27654139">The Civil Rights case is of course involved in number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6890.800" offset="27668767">Two or three of them got to the Court several terms back in 1878 term or 1879 term.</text>
            <text syncTime="6899.552" offset="27703771">At that time, a brief was filed by Attorney General Devens and then Assistant Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="6908.236" offset="27738462">And there is in one passage that -- of course they were very short briefs as they were in those days.</text>
            <text syncTime="6914.187" offset="27762286">There is one passage there that alludes to the fact, the Act is being applied to a railroad which would of course, and he said in effect, be subject to regulation under the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="6925.491" offset="27807530">Then he went on and argued the whole case under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6930.307" offset="27826756">Then that brief was apparently forgotten, as I suppose our brief sometimes are.</text>
            <text syncTime="6934.920" offset="27845251">And when the case came on for argument two years -- four years later, I think, Solicitor General Phillips filed another brief and that's the one that most people look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="6947.796" offset="27896764">And that brief makes no reference to commerce whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="6951.715" offset="27912437">Then of course the Court, as opposed to the conclusion of the opinion -- I won't stop to read it but you will find very close to the conclusion of the majority opinion, a statement that no argument under the commerce clause is pressed upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6968.227" offset="27978475">I suggest that I gave at least one of the reasons earlier, now I don't mean to be disingenuous that maybe different views about the commerce clause today than they were then.</text>
            <text syncTime="6978.795" offset="28020793">But I do submit most seriously, that many of these differences are differences in the factual conditions that exist today and not any difference in the principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="6990.442" offset="28067291">Now that's why I suggest that very sincerely -- the print case here falls within the principle laid down by Chief Justice Marshall and Gibbon and ogden and that is virtually as old as the constitution itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="7025.875" offset="28209084">The argument counsel today is quite different from the argument Solicitor General made in case of Bell versus Howell.</text>
            <text syncTime="7035.325" offset="28246909">I'd like to read one statement that's reported in your opinion, that the Solicitor General made.</text>
            <text syncTime="7041.199" offset="28270315">The preservation of a free and pluralistic society which seemed to require substantial freedom for private chores in social business and professional associations, freedom of choice means an ability to be wrong as well as right, to be mean as well as noble, to be vicious as well as kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="7061.337" offset="28350877">And even if that deal were questioned, the philosophy of federalism leads an area for the choice to the states and their people.</text>
            <text syncTime="7069.157" offset="28382224">When the state is not otherwise involved, instead of vesting the only power of executive decision in the federal courts -- how did you square that with the argument today --</text>

            <text syncTime="7091.468" offset="28471458">But his argument today, may it place the Court, is that the Congress had the right to pass this Act about all motels because motels deal in people, and people get to the motels by interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="7110.379" offset="28547109">And that for all people, that come into that motel or in interstate commerce and be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="7119.464" offset="28583366">He further says that the real reason that Congress has a right to therefore pass legislation affects all motels and all people is because of the conditions that are arisen in this country that places burdens on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="7137.535" offset="28655673">Now, I remember the brief filed in this case by the government talks about the burdens that existed in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="7144.251" offset="28682527">But his brief also shows in Atlanta, Georgia that there were 14 major hotels that had already desegregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="7153.368" offset="28718994">As a matter of fact, it shows how much business he says we've gotten in Atlanta that goes ahead and the truth of the matter is, the Heart of Atlanta Motel is the only place in the Atlanta, Georgia that hasn't desegregated voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="7166.496" offset="28771553">Now let's turn the Court in the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="7169.243" offset="28782524">Suppose the Heart of Atlanta is the only place in Atlanta that doesn't desegregate voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="7176.107" offset="28810005">Does that one motel affect commerce so badly and place such a burden on it that Congress can pass a law?</text>
            <text syncTime="7185.549" offset="28847726">If I had one motel out of 60,000 in the United States as the only one that doesn't desegregate, does that place a burden on Congress -- on interstate commerce?</text>
            <text syncTime="7196.472" offset="28891402">And if the purpose of the passing of the Civil Rights Act was to relieve the burden on interstate commerce -- by virtue of reference to the things that happened in Birmingham and Little Rock and so forth, all of which happened some time ago now thank goodness.</text>
            <text syncTime="7214.230" offset="28962455">If it was to relieve the burden on interstate commerce, has it done so?</text>
            <text syncTime="7221.021" offset="28989623">All the desegregation mostly and the most citizen in the south as occurred before the passage of the Civil Rights Act, there is no mentioned in the brief for an argument of the things that have happened since the passage of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7233.454" offset="29039360">There is no mention of riots in the streets in New York or Rochester or Philadelphia, has the Act accomplished anything?</text>
            <text syncTime="7244.626" offset="29084082">This Court is not here to determine whether Congress acting wisely or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="7249.352" offset="29102994">It is only here to determine where it acted legally within the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="7258.048" offset="29137789">Now so to said that there's only -- there's only question, was there a rational basis for the legislative determination based on the burden placed on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="7269.254" offset="29182615">We get to the question to Mr. Justice Black posed in the morning, and Mr. Justice Goldberg posed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7276.650" offset="29212186">And I have to come to grips with it to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="7280.073" offset="29225874">And the question is, can Congress control racial discrimination by an individual where there is no state connection at all and it is none in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="7293.137" offset="29278119">Then, all laws in the -- on the books of the State of Georgia or in the City of Atlanta, with two exceptions, one of them is anti-trespass law which does not mention race as a ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="7303.796" offset="29320751">It can be used to keep anybody in this courtroom out of a man's place, if he wants to.</text>
            <text syncTime="7308.765" offset="29340604">And the other one is as far as I know they're all about the marriage of races.</text>
            <text syncTime="7313.229" offset="29358472">But if the Congress can pass the law to call all commerce and include all motels, we have to face the issue whether or not one individual is the gauge or whether one individual -- one individual be -- with all other business in that filed such as Reliance Fuel Oil cases, will affect all commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="7340.462" offset="29467455">And whether or not -- the phrase used by the counsel frequently in his argument about commercial activities is sufficient to give Congress the power to pass regulations on a code of law that effect personal conduct of individuals.</text>
