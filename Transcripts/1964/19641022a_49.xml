            <text syncTime="24.793" offset="99161">This case involves a prosecution on Louisiana statute, annotated revised statute, Section 4 -- Title XIV, Section 401, which is an identical counterpart of a Federal Act to be founded 18 U.S.C. 1507.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.165" offset="184633">Substantially, these Acts prohibit the picketing, operating in or near courthouse or in or near a building or residence occupied or used by a judge, juror, witness or court official with the intent of interfering with obstructing or impeding the administration of justice or with the intent of influencing any such official.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.177" offset="328620">As I understood the appellant's argument yesterday, understanding to be first that although he recognizes the right of the State to pass such a law, that the Louisiana Supreme Court and the Louisiana lower court applied an unconstitutional standard or in effect did not apply this clear and present danger standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.289" offset="469055">Although there is no litigative history on the state, nor this federal statute, appellant relies upon the history of cases dealing with contempt of court cases wherein it was overt and that there was an infringement on the right of speech, free speech and freedom of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.033" offset="592039">These cases of course deal per se with freedom of speech and freedom of press.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.809" offset="631223">These contempt cases too that counsel have -- has cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.638" offset="658495">As pointed out by the State's Supreme Court, and as it's known by everyone, picketing factually is not the equivalent of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.528" offset="714083">And consequently, as this Court has said, it is not equal in legal equivalent.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.003" offset="1171958">Now, I think this question -- this question of -- of authority was in part in the cases -- in one of the cases yesterday, into the breach of peace case, because in that case, one of the elements was to refuse to disburse on the oath of an officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.285" offset="1269133">Now, in that sense, authorization would be relevant but authorization to commit crime by an officer or anyone else; would only make him an accomplice.</text>

            <text syncTime="638.712" offset="2554776">Now as you may recall, this congregation gathered, at the old State Capitol grounds which is approximately two blocks from the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.011" offset="2612036">The first officer, to talk to appellant, was the chief criminal deputy of the sheriff -- of the Sheriff's office of east Baton Rouge Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.493" offset="2653936">Here's his testimony, the transcript of the trial court page 253, and I quote, And I asked him the purpose of the demonstration --, this is Chief Kling talking about his conversation with Cox.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.665" offset="2722586">And I asked him the purpose of the demonstration, he told me that he and these people were demonstrating in the protest of the illegal arrest of some of their people who have been held and jailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.265" offset="2761038">I asked him if he didn't think the court was the proper place to decide the legality of the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.444" offset="2785698">And I told him further that the accumulation of those people there, creating an explosive situation, wouldn't that could erupt into serious trouble and I asked him to disband them and take them back from whence they came.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.030" offset="2836062">Question: Did he acquiesce in your request?</text>
            <text syncTime="711.502" offset="2845989">He did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.750" offset="2854975">And he said, I told him the second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.879" offset="2863438">I asked him to disperse the people in interest of peace and harmony and he told me he was coming by the building referring to the court building.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.539" offset="2894054">And I told him then that if any of violence resulted, I felt that it would be his responsibility whether he say, he said no, it would be the police officer's responsibility that as an officer, that he was duly to bound to protect him and the other people.</text>

            <text syncTime="863.168" offset="3452656">And we called him back and he said that we would be there about seven minutes and then that they would return to the campus at Southern University.</text>

            <text syncTime="1677.884" offset="6711484">Now, therefore it is -- you can greatly see that there is a greater need for this sort of law in the state system, than that -- than that would be in the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.035" offset="6752131">However, all of these goes into the question of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.043" offset="6764147">I think if that was a clear violation of the law, the fact that this police officer told them to go ahead and do it, I don't think that would make any difference at all.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nils Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="3644.255" offset="14576953">If this were a case of the evenhanded administration of justice, many of the issues raised here would not be as perplexing as they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.811" offset="14623242">However, our basic position is that the streets and sidewalks are natural places for people to express their views and if they have no less right to express the view of anti-segregation, then they have a right to express the views on anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.132" offset="14720522">Much has been made of the fact that the activities took on an aspect of picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.874" offset="14763468">I might suggest that there were other areas of the demonstration which took off the aspect -- a greater aspect of free speech, the pledging allegiance to the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.597" offset="14830341">This would suggest a support of the government rather than an attempt to destruct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.655" offset="14866599">The singing a patriotic songs, likewise, the singing of religious songs would seem to me to suggest that this was to be nonviolent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.761" offset="14918949">The fact that the previous date, the police knew, the fact of the matter is and the testimony of Ronnie Moore on behalf of the defense, states that when the students were leaving Southern University, the Negro bus drivers were arrested so that the Negroes would not get to town.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.116" offset="15024379">The students, when the bus drivers were arrested, got out and walked to four or five miles to town, which is the reason why the demonstration took place around 12 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.053" offset="15072131">This is free speech, nothing more, nothing less what did the picket signs say?</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.091" offset="15100343">The picket signs didn't say Judge Blanche.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.242" offset="15112882">Judge Blanche might have had a subjective intent or Judge Blanche might have had a subject to feeling that he was intimidated but this is not the test, the test of whether or not there was a danger to the obstruction of justice is an objective test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.555" offset="15190204">Individually, Judge Blanche might have been with all due respect, it's a little more timid than the reasonable judge who happens to be in a courthouse before a demonstration in protest of segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3817.484" offset="15269930">Not only were there city police present, the men were taken off leave and put on duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.293" offset="15309113">This was supplanted -- this was supplemented by deputy sheriffs, by the state police by afar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.341" offset="15361358">The meeting wasn't stopped because the time was up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.872" offset="15379435">The mention on the time was just incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.521" offset="15394064">The testimony of the two chief representatives of the State, the Chief of Police and the criminal sheriff, they were there, they approved, they directed, they saw the signs, they heard the songs, it was all right for Negroes to be down there only because as one of them testified, it was already an accomplished plot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.337" offset="15537319">But hadn't been an accomplished plot and hadn't the students walk from Scotlandville, they would have prevented it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.600" offset="15582354">The demonstration was alright to testify until Cox said, let's sit in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.414" offset="15617567">This is wrong, this is a Negro, this is Baton Rouge, this is assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.019" offset="15652049">We are not to disprove of illegal activities, illegal arrests, illegal laws, illegal feet-dragging, judicial feet-dragging.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.985" offset="15751837">The sheriff and some of the witnesses testified that there was tenseness in the surroundings immediately before the teargas was thrown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.019" offset="15815993">We suggest that tenseness alone is not sufficient to create a clear and present danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.231" offset="15856849">We suggest that these -- all the indicia, all the facts, this demonstration was a peaceful one, there was nothing to indicate that the people were going to storm the jails.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.233" offset="15928842">With reference to the specific intent in the state's brief on page 19, the state may express mention on the fact that they placed particular emphasis on the size of the group, on the fact that these people said that they were there to protest the illegal arrest as if there was no right to protest illegal arrest, the fact that it was near the courthouse and the fact that there was shouting and yelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4018.868" offset="16075442">It took these four items to be sufficient facts from which it could infer the specific intent to obstruct justice and to influence the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.628" offset="16150465">I suggest that this is not sufficient evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.631" offset="16178469">This is no evidence upon which to impute to a man a crime as serious as obstructing justice and influencing the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.677" offset="16222668">I think it's entirely illegal unconstitutional and immoral to sentence a man to one year in jail and $5000 because they were shouting and yelling.</text>
