            <label>Mr. John C. Danielson</label>
            <text syncTime="45.856" offset="183380">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.830" offset="195291">This matter arises from a connection of two railroads in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the Milwaukee Road, one of the appellees and the Lake Superior and Ishpeming one of the other appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.913" offset="259553">These are both Class 1 railroads subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the significant fact of the lesser luminary, the Lake Superior and Ishpeming which we shall as the L.S.&amp; I. is that it is controlled significantly by the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company as the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.433" offset="349727">Now, this connection is the first time in history as the record likewise shows that these two railroads have ever been physically connected.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.977" offset="403853">Now, there appears in the record a large print which was prepared by the appellant, Milwaukee, showing this situation where the mainline and it is important I suggest in view of certain decisions of this Court that this is the mainline of the Ishpeming, L.S. &amp; I., coming down here and ultimately terminating at iron mine at a place called Republic, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.423" offset="521613">Likewise, here comes the mainline of the Milwaukee up and ultimately terminating at a point called Champion, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.469" offset="557871">The connection is constructed here between these two points shown as A to B, rather small, 262 feet in all to accomplish the connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.659" offset="602593">But the Court should see that it is physically impossible for trains ever to operate this connection and to deliver cars upon these interchanged tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.840" offset="655360">The red shows Milwaukee ownership, the blue shows the L.S.&amp; I. ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.177" offset="672705">It is physically impossible in the first instance for the Milwaukee ever to achieve the delivery which we call interchange, the placement of a car routed with traffic in a position where another railroad may pick it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.261" offset="732996">Impossible physically to operate under these interchanged tracks by the Milwaukee without operating between C and D, the main line of the Ishpeming.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.353" offset="777404">The Court should see also, and it is important because the court below did not see this.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="199.806" offset="799138">Is your client an intervenor?</text>

          <turn speaker="john_c_danielson" startTime="202.277" stopTime="449.495">
            <label>Mr. John C. Danielson</label>
            <text syncTime="202.277" offset="809064">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.132" offset="816483">Northwestern intervened in the complaint brought by the railroad which is not here, the Sew Line, in the proceeding before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.489" offset="849920">The Commission proceeding culminated in a three-judge review in a federal court in Wisconsin and is hereby direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.920" offset="879595">Now, not only is it necessary for Milwaukee to operate on the L.S.&amp; I. mainline in order to arrive on these interchanged tracks, but having arrived on its track one, where it delivers its locomotive on the head end of these cars must come up on to the L.S.&amp; I. in order to return back to the Milwaukee Road either through track two if there are no L.S.&amp; I. cars waiting to be taken on to the Milwaukee or over the L.S.&amp; I. mainline for a very significant, what we have here, roughly 3000 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.659" offset="1026612">Now, originally this was set up as a lease of the mainline of the L.S.&amp; I. to the Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.400" offset="1053571">Once the Commission received the complaint of the other intervenor, Sew Line, the lease was changed into a form of agreement which is set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.155" offset="1080529">The lease originally appears in the record beginning at page 49, describes the lease of L.S.&amp; I.'s main track on that page and on page 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.689" offset="1146671">At the hearing before the Interstate Commerce Commission, the agreement was transformed into a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.445" offset="1177704">We contend this makes no difference, tracked rights being involved may be a personal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.929" offset="1199647">They involve no necessary estate in the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.585" offset="1210305">This Court has so held in Thompson against the Texas-Mexican Railroad Company in the 328 Volume of the United States reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.634" offset="1246459">Well, the form then should make no difference but the court below was confused into thinking that, and it left out one element of the preceding we feel that and the court below held at page 390 of the record that there was no operation by either of these appellees across the line of the other's railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.121" offset="1360457">The fact here is that it is physically impossible to accomplish this interchange of traffic without that type of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.144" offset="1392536">Now, once there was a connection through routes were established by rate action taken by the Milwaukee and the L.S.&amp; I.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.858" offset="1431406">A connection of course is a sine qua non of through routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.044" offset="1448124">Without the connection, there can be no through routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.110" offset="1460349">Now, prior to this time, there existed between the point designated Sunrise Landing on Lake Superior and Ishpeming, this is contracted from an exhibit in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.780" offset="1523043">It's very dramatically oversimplified.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.937" offset="1535687">There existed between a major shipping point, Sunrise Landing owned by Cleveland-Cliffs shipping, Cleveland-Cliffs forest products, a two-line through route between Northwestern and L.S.&amp; I. where L.S.&amp; I. could bring the traffic either to Ishpeming or a lower point designated, Little Lake, transport to Northwestern and bring it to Iron Mountain, Michigan where there was located a substantial consuming industry and to which the predominant portion of this traffic moved as the Commission found.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.214" offset="1688764">The fact of the two-line interchange was important because the record shows and the Commission found that unless the receiver at Iron Mountain could have two-line rates in his inbound forest products, sawlogs, chemical woods, the grades of the classification in terms of absolutely low rated commodities.</text>

            <text syncTime="474.155" offset="1896594">Quite low rated as the Commission did find sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.163" offset="1908611">Now, the Milwaukee could participate in such a movement, but it could not make a two-line move with L.S.&amp; I.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.957" offset="1943824">There was no physical connection at this point which was to become republic junction.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.215" offset="1964826">Then, it puts do it with the Sew Line as a three-line route more expensive and would not be competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.987" offset="2003905">The record is quite clear on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.997" offset="2011951">After October 21, when the connection was constructed, the route existed and the records show more than half of the traffic began flowing this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.359" offset="2057404">This the Commission found contrary to the public interest because the industry in this area in its opinion was not adequate to sustain the existing operations after diluting this traffic, this light density low rated traffic, among so many more carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.952" offset="2143713">Now, the issue as it arose three-judge court was jurisdiction, this is a word of many facets and it has always caused complications and the essential facts or the essential theories were these.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.119" offset="2216438">The Milwaukee and the L.S.&amp; I. had always relied upon an old Missouri Pacific case.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.940" offset="2239739">And we, in our turn, had relied upon the Alabama and Vicksburg decision of this Court in the 271 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.390" offset="2277460">Now, the -- do not mistake our thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.598" offset="2302328">We suggest that in Alabama and Vicksburg there was more than the single element of a connection between the main lines of two major railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.892" offset="2339527">We feel, however, that isn't an alternative disposition in that case, certainly no less.This Court held that the Commission must have jurisdiction over connections between mainlines of Class 1 railroad, because of the competitive consequences which emanate from it, because of the possibility of thereby opening up new through routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.683" offset="2430642">Now, the Commission did find that by virtue of this connection the competitive picture changed quite drastically in the territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.851" offset="2475363">Now, the court below made three serious mistakes we feel.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.635" offset="2494485">First, it went outside the record in order to sustain several of the findings which are contained in its report.</text>

            <text syncTime="643.370" offset="2573479">Now, there was ample opportunity in a hearing before a commission examiner in a returned questionnaire in the various applications filed by these applicants below to assert this.It does not appear in this record anywhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.979" offset="3119856">Now, second, this Court sitting as a reviewing court put itself in the position of a court deciding in the first instance whether being approached by a railroad with the assertion that its competitor was building an unauthorized connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.958" offset="3195820">It, the one-judge court should compel that competing railroad to go to the Interstate Commerce Commission and establish that the interconnection was compatible with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.440" offset="3245662">Now, there have been established a long line of cases and several tests pretty well settling what are the elements of inquiry of a one-judge court in such a matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.887" offset="3291533">We respectfully submit that this is far from the function of a reviewing court after the commission has passed upon the juris -- pardon me, upon the jurisdictional question, and after it has passed on it here as it did so carefully in its report, and after as it observes and its examiner observes this disposition is consistent with the Commission's uniformed practice in these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.424" offset="3397695">And we would like to point out that the more recent decisions of this Court which we explain at considerable length in the briefs here are positively repugnant in our opinion with that construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.386" offset="3461538">Now, this Court dealt with two decisions here, Powell against the United States and the United States versus Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.114" offset="3492362">Both three-judge courts, both affirmed here on holdings that where the jurisdictional question arose before the Commission ought to differ entirely because this was mixed question of law and fact susceptible of resolution only in a federal court not before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.782" offset="3579089">We submit to the Court that the Commission has evolved the practice which lays Mr. Justice Brandeis foundation there at rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.191" offset="3628722">And that the Commission is now able as it was here and in many other cases which we have decided to bring recalcitrant carriers before it, and to apply a transportation standard to these statutory specifics in determining whether the public interest permits an interconnection.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.034" offset="3704059">Now, this Powell and Idaho series of cases we submit hs been seriously eroded by the District Courts applying these standards ultimately by the Second Circuit which we have cited to the Court already.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.361" offset="3777411">We have the State of Illinois case.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.313" offset="3785247">We have the State of Georgia case.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.281" offset="3793084">We have the Yonkers decisions which the federal courts now have come to recognize as giving the Commission first instance power and presumptive weight on review in determining this essential element of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.760" offset="3854942">For as this Court found in Yonkers, as this Court rules squarely in Yonkers, without the jurisdictional decision by the Interstate Commission a federal court ought had nothing to do with review of its order.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.806" offset="3915128">These are basic questions of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.836" offset="3927249">We have the states and the Interstate Commission constantly in a turmoil as to whose power shall dispose of the public interest question.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.667" offset="3950655">And this Court, we feel, made this quite clear in the Yonkers case that without that decision by the Commission, there could be nothing further in an abandonment or an extension proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.751" offset="4022962">The Commission made those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.741" offset="4030903">They are eminently well reasonably submitted, and they ought to have been treated with not finality by with the presumptive weight which ordinarily attaches to the routine disposition by the administrative agency of these essential elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.223" offset="4108852">Now, the Court had this question before it in the State of Georgia case where the jurisdictional statement argued at page 26 in number 774 of the October term of 1957, and I quote, "The jurisdiction of the Commission must be decided by the Court unhampered by findings of the Commission, the scope of judicial inquiry into this matter being unrestricted."</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.223" offset="4228807">Now, we don't suggest that some reaffirmance here disposed of that as a complete disposition by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.192" offset="4264751">We do suggest, however, that the regular erosion which preceded the State of Georgia case was receiving at least acquiescence from this Court by the summary affirmance which resulted in that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.784" offset="4335073">Now, the court below took one unique aberrational decision, it took the Missouri-Pacific matter and relying upon that said, "This is too small a matter for the Interstate Commerce Commission to concern itself with."</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.061" offset="4416157">If the Court were to look at the Missouri-Pacific decision it would find, this is in 60 F.2d commencing at page 126.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.591" offset="4454296">It would find that the carriers there seeking to interchange at that time had and historically had had an interchange which permitted them to connect and to establish and there were established a line of through routes over them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.879" offset="4539455">A second carrier came in not party to this proceeding and said, "We want you to" -- it acquired the little bridge line over which these two carriers had interchanged in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.050" offset="4596193">It said, "Now you'll do it with us a different way."</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.317" offset="4609254">And they said, "Well we'll simply build across and forget with any need for your service."</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.415" offset="4633600">And in fact that was done and the court there said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.008" offset="4648020">There's no significant competitive or other change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.883" offset="4663484">We find no need for it to go to the Interstate Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.075" offset="4676232">That is a far cry we submit from the type of decision here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1216.895" offset="4867553">Now, the final problem that occurs here and we submit ought to concern this Court is this, that this court below equated an invasion of territory under the Texas and Pacific case with an extension of line as designated by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.241" offset="4948950">It said that without an invasion, there could be no extension and therefore no 118 disposing of physical invasion because we would not contend that his 262 feet is a physical invasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.738" offset="5010913">It said that there can be other type of extension under Section 118, not so says the Interstate Commission, because in a case which we have cited, the case which ultimately came to this Court and was affirmed under the State of Georgia decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.122" offset="5076428">The Commission said, "We have three tests of extension."</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.600" offset="5090325">This appears at page 20 of our original brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.855" offset="5103386">It said, "This include among other things matters pertaining to the purpose of the track" and then "Whether new routes in interstate commerce would be established through the use of such track" and then as a third element "whether the construction and operation would constitute an invasion."</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.585" offset="5182276">So to the Interstate Commission, there are three tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.332" offset="5193247">It has applied these tests for quite a long while.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.513" offset="5205995">And the court says, "There can be but one, as we announce the statute to you the Commission, you have found an incorrect test of extension therefore you may not be sustained."</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.515" offset="5258031">This, we submit, unduly restricts the Commission and its routine administration of the statute with which it is charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.657" offset="5294602">Finally, the Milwaukee concedes and the Ishpeming at page 38 of their brief that there would be 118 jurisdiction over this extension if there were trackage rights and it argues with simply an ipse dixit for authority that because they reach no new terminal there are none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.755" offset="5383001">We submit that the Alabama and Vicksburg decision, the Thompson versus Texas-Mexican decision and the many decisions cited by the Interstate Commerce Commission added to by Milwaukee's own preceding before the Interstate Commerce Commission under Section 118 to abandon and interchange nder almost identical circumstances indicate very clearly that there does exist this element of Section 118 jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.828" offset="5535242">The District Court did not deal with this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.045" offset="5548095">Now, we would therefore contend that the decision of the Commission clearly had a complete support in its evidential record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.874" offset="5595429">It was amply rationalized and that it had a very ample foundation in repeated decisions not only of this Court, but its own uniform practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.082" offset="5648300">And upon that basis, there was no need nor to the decision of this Court permit, re-decision of the issue anew by the reviewing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.548" offset="5690096">If there is time remaining, I should like to use it for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1510.369" offset="6041391">In my opinion, one justification where the Commission's 118 jurisdiction would be a very expensive construction of trackage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.093" offset="6084336">Expensive to the extent that it would imperil the financial status of the carrier making the construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.270" offset="6113071">If as in the Texas case, that should be the case, then I believe the Commission rightly could take jurisdiction under Section 118.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.739" offset="6150896">However, in this case the track cost only $28,000 and considering the size and the financial position of both railroads involved that expenditure would be minimal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1578.753" offset="6314945">No trains move from one railroad to another via the connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.880" offset="6335425">The operation is simply one of switching.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.658" offset="6346606">The same sort of switching which occurs in any railroad yard, and for this reason Mr. Chief Justice, it would be my opinion that no matter how long the track was so long as the operation were a purely a switching operation, there would be no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.161" offset="6424555">Section 122 clearly and specifically exempts switching tracks from the requirements of Section 118 and therefore of course from the Commission's Section 118 jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2557.242" offset="10228924">And even to this, Interstate Commerce Commission approval under Section 118 must be obtained not however because the trains move over the connecting track but because the trains move over the track of the other railroad pursuant to the trackage rights and to a new destination.</text>
