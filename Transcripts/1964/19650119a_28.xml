            <text syncTime="17.155" offset="68545">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.783" offset="87040">My name is Matthew McCann and I'm a lawyer in Worcester, Massachusetts, and I represent the defendant in this action, Mr. Giacomo Ventresca.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.661" offset="122567">Very briefly so that you will know what happened here, I have a trial practice and this man was referred to me for purposes of handling his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.016" offset="159974">He was arrested for possession of an illegal distill in the home or rather in a cellar of his house at 148 1/2 Coburn Avenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.479" offset="197904">That house is a couple of miles from where my office is located and what happened here was that a search warrant was sought for on August 30, 1961 to search the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.208" offset="248790">That affidavit -- that a search warrant was bottomed on an affidavit, which is the principal issue or the central issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.843" offset="279301">On September 1, the search was made and the distill was seized in the cellar of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.158" offset="304588">It was done about quarter of nine in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.285" offset="317127">Mr. Ventresca and his wife and family were still in their pajamas.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.178" offset="332696">The federal officers entered under authority of the search warrant, went into the cellar, seized and apprehended distill and destroyed the contraband they found there.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.448" offset="373760">And quite collaterally went up to the second floor and rifled the contents of the bureau drawer and the top of the bureau and took the wallet out of the man's pants pocket, which were hanging on the closet door and alike and so, I filed a motion to suppress the evidence and have it returned.</text>

            <text syncTime="121.054" offset="484206">So that those extraneous matters – items, which should not have been seized, matters of evidence rather than matters of crime were returned, but I lost the motion hearing on the matter of the hearsay affidavit, which I thought it to be and the case proceeded to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.202" offset="548780">I tried the case in the Federal District Court of Boston and I lost it and the man was given a jail sentence and a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.702" offset="578769">I took an appeal to the Circuit Court for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.959" offset="595801">And the three court, three-judge bench sustained my appeal and reversed the sentence, reversed the judgment on a split decision two to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.236" offset="636865">Judge Hartigan deciding in the favor of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.155" offset="652539">Judge Woodbury filed a dissent and Judge Aldrich filed a concurring opinion, which really -- when you read it was more of a dissent to the dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.201" offset="692767">Then the government requested and was granted certiorari and we are now here.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.508" offset="710008">Now, the affidavit was looked at yesterday, but since it is the central issue in the case, I think it would be well to start off today again simply by looking at the two key paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.756" offset="750968">This affidavit was really a sandwich type in the sense that it had an introductory paragraph, a short one and a concluding paragraph, which was a short one.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.590" offset="790256">And then sandwiched in between the beginning and the end were two and a quarter pages of typed material, single space on legal sized paper, many, many facts were cited, sandwiched in between the beginning and the end, but without any specification or identification as you know from yesterday's argument as to who saw what or whether the people who gave the information to the affiant themselves saw what were reported.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.310" offset="981159">Now, is it not apparent that those two paragraphs that these are investigators who smelled the mash?</text>

            <text syncTime="339.517" offset="1358054">Well, we don't know in this affidavit, whether the affiant knew anything that was substantial or that went to the merits of the probable cause as the Court in Boston said, probably the only thing the affiant knew was the defendant's address or the color of the defendant's automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.281" offset="1429107">And in fact, I think the government has conceded Mr. Justice Clark that this affidavit can only fairly be looked upon as a total hearsay, since the affiant didn't make it clear just what it was he saw if he any thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="395.972" offset="1583856">If an affidavit were so drawn and it was clear that it was intended to rely on the smell and smell alone, and attention was focused on that one issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.017" offset="1628056">And there was some substantiation of some lateral support to what the hearsay was that was in the affidavit or there was some reason why the names of the informers could not be disclosed.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.221" offset="1676852">Well under Jones, would all those things have to be true or would it not have been enough?</text>

            <label>Mr. Matthew R. McCann</label>

            <text syncTime="426.221" offset="1704856">If I may discuss the Jones case, in that case, Didone was the affiant and the affidavit is spelled out on the footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.295" offset="1733172">And he relied on hearsay insofar as that item was concerned, which went to the probable cause, the existence of narcotics in someone's apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.397" offset="1777580">But your bench five years ago in that case went on to say that there was some substantiation beyond the hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.385" offset="1801509">Didone personally knew things too when he put them in the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.342" offset="1817287">He knew that these people had a narcotics record and he said so in the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.351" offset="1833378">They admitted to him, use of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.848" offset="1843304">They had admitted, shown him needle marks in their arms, and that was in the affidavit in the Jones case.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.726" offset="1866815">So your Court went on to say that hearsay does not disqualify an affidavit, but I don't read the Jones case and many courts do not, as opening the way to a hearsay affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.202" offset="1908715">I think there maybe some confusion on the circuits and in the District Courts and in the State Courts as a result of the wording of the Jones case as to just what you meant by some substantiation giving credit to the hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.690" offset="1958661">Some courts I think have thought since the Jones decision that now hearsay affidavits are okay or rather affidavits, which aren't affidavits at all are okay.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.521" offset="2202018">And we are not dealing here with rules of prohibative evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="566.292" offset="2265130">An affidavit means that he has sworn that what he said is the truth, and he knows it.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.333" offset="2285296">Now the Jones case watered down the Fourth Amendment just a little bit, and I believe it's a good law and it said that there are instances in these affidavits where some hearsay can creep in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1006.637" offset="4026514">And the Ramirez case went on to say for under Jones the affiant must not only believe the hearsay report, but in all likelihood the affiant must further demonstrate that his informant has established a reputation for reliability so as to be worthy of belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.243" offset="4088895">And this Second Circuit case goes on to say again, in addition, Jones may require that the affidavit includes some factual information independently corroborative of the hearsay report.</text>

            <text syncTime="1348.051" offset="5392196">But we should look of course at the possibility or at the case where the search is not successful and there are unsuccessful searches and then we go back and look at the affidavit as we could in this case and we would go to Mr. Mazaka and we would say, “We did what you wanted us to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.545" offset="5458129">We tore the house as under as in Boston recently.</text>

            <text syncTime="1373.562" offset="5494178">And you'd go back and look at the affidavit and to out who it was who signed it and Mr. Mazaka could say, “Don't ask me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.190" offset="5520718">I didn't say in here that I saw anything” and then you could say, “Well, Mr. Mazaka, who was it that told you these things that resulted in the government tearing this man's house apart stick-by-stick, rifle through the back pocket of his pants when he wasn't in them” and Mr. Mazaka would have to say “Government investigators with a capital I”, and that's meaningless to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.186" offset="5604728">Then you would say, “Mr. Mazaka, who were they?</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.091" offset="5612356">They are superior and the treasury department would like to talk with them.” Well, I don't remember anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.169" offset="5632627">It would be a possible answer.</text>
