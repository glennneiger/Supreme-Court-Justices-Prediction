            <text syncTime="21.885" offset="87458">This case involves railroad rates for the transportation of property in Interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.117" offset="116402">The rates were published in the spring of 1959 and the case is now five-and-a-half years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.735" offset="146913">The rates were first published by the New Haven Railroad but were promptly followed by the publication of equivalent rates for the New York Central, the Boston and Maine, the Maine Central, and the Central of Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.970" offset="207830">Generally speaking, the rates applied from the principal cities of New England to Chicago, Illinois and St. Louis, Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.164" offset="248581">Certain Midwestern railroads which provided the connections for the New England lines to those cities also became parties to the rates.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="71.273" offset="285048">These were westbound only?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="homer_s_carpenter" startTime="72.465" stopTime="426.740">
            <label>Mr. Homer S. Carpenter</label>
            <text syncTime="72.465" offset="289855">Yes sir, westbound only, Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.486" offset="301871">The reason that the new rates applied only to those two cities was by election of the New Haven itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.133" offset="344503">Their purpose was to compete with a new plan of railroad service which was trailer-on-flatcar.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.647" offset="374491">It was called Plan III and was instituted in New England by the New York Central in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.440" offset="413675">The New York Central offered that service and its initial phase only to those two cities and the Plan III trailer-on-flatcar service was of a special nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.208" offset="472816">It was provided that charges which were essentially flat charges in the sense that they were stated in aggregate sums of money to apply for the transportation not to exceed 70,000 pounds of freight and not to exceed two trailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.235" offset="560901">There was a further restriction on those trailer-on-flatcar rates that -- or the trailer-on-flatcar charges that no one commodity in the total shipment could exceed 60% of the aggregate weight of the shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.401" offset="625580">The tariff also provided that the trailers had to be supplied by the shipper and that the shipper likewise had to supply his own bridge service between the commercial installation and the railroad terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.356" offset="693394">As a matter of actual practice, however, the New York Central was leasing trailers to shippers on a one way trip lease and was providing the bridge service both other than tariff charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.865" offset="759432">Now, the effect to this new service on the New Haven Railroad was immediate.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.043" offset="780121">Within the first two months that the service was offered by the New York Central, the New Haven lost 400 car loads of traffic to these two destinations which it could identify.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.756" offset="846994">I should also point out that the New Haven had also published these Plan III charges for the new trailer-on-flatcar service but it had some disabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.440" offset="905718">It had two gateways to the west.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.327" offset="917211">One at Maybrook, New York and the other one in New York City itself, I think the New Haven called the Harlem River where it made connection with westbound carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.480" offset="957858">The clearances on both of those routes were not such as to permit the standard size trailer on a standard height boxcar or flatcar to be transported.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.858" offset="1011357">The New Haven, however, had been using a special sort of a car, they called it a clisham car which carried the trailer at the lower level than an ordinary flatcar but it couldn't very well provide that service to the west because the unloading facilities for this specialized car were not maintained by all of its connections.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.624" offset="1122429">It had under progress, however, a program for eliminating its low occurrences and accordingly it published these new rates which are an issue here subject to an expiration date.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.720" offset="1190870">The expiration date was in September of 1959 prior to at time it came along that expiration date was postponed.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.991" offset="1231935">By September of 1959, the clearance problems what the New Haven had encountered, had been cleared up with respect to one of its routes, the one through Maybrook.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.842" offset="1295360">And of course, that gave it access to the both -- both cities that is Chicago and St.Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.799" offset="1327125">Moreover it -- it also secured from the Interstate Commerce Commission by that time, permission to substitute two short flatcars for one long one.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.126" offset="1364428">The original Plan III contemplated that there would be two trailers to each flatcar and the New Haven didn't have long flatcars.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.761" offset="1402984">I mentioned these matters because I think it's important due to the fact that the New Haven, even after it had eliminated its difficulties that I have spoken of and was in a position to secure the traffic under Plan III continued nonetheless to press for approval of these rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.117" offset="1488457">This was recognized by the Commission in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.932" offset="1503713">When the rates were first published, they were suspended on the petition of the appellants here.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.124" offset="1536418">Then later, that suspension was vacated upon petition of the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.153" offset="1572571">However, the Commission continued its investigation which had instituted the time the suspension took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.055" offset="1604127">Now by the provisions, the Interstate Commerce Act, the burden of justifying a change in freight rates is upon the proponent of that change that the hearing which the Commission held, only the New Haven undertook the discharge effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.120" offset="1668389">The other railroads simply stated that they published the rates for the purpose of remaining competitive with the New Haven itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="463.867" offset="1855425">The rates were stated to apply upon traffic that was transported in boxcars.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.931" offset="1891683">And I should point out here that the New Haven had a surplus of these boxcars for westbound move.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.375" offset="1921463">The rates were expressed in cents per 100 pounds but they were graded by reference to the amount of weight in a given shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.147" offset="1968588">That is to say that the highest of these rates was at 45% of first class and it applied to shipments of 20,000 pounds minimum weight and the rates were graded downward as the minimum weights increased by 10,000 pounds increments until at 70,000 pounds the rates were 19% of first class.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.105" offset="2076317">The rates had application upon virtually any commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.955" offset="2107768">The only exceptions were livestock, perishables, explosives and articles highly susceptible to damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.027" offset="2144026">With those limited exclusions, it applied where the rates applied whether the shipments were in single commodity carloads or in carloads of mixed commodities.</text>

            <text syncTime="547.993" offset="2191882">Well, I suppose in addition to those specific exceptions, there are good many commodities that simply can't travel in boxcars, isn't that true?</text>

            <text syncTime="558.045" offset="2232111">As a practical matter, yes, the rates were -- the rates were restricted to transportation in boxcars, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.938" offset="2263667">In addition, the rates had alternative application with all the other boxcar rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.454" offset="2289789">By that, I mean that if there was a lower rate published for any particular commodity for boxcar movement, that lower rate would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.518" offset="2326047">These rates serve only to mark the ceiling at which the railroad charge would be computed.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.163" offset="2360633">After hearing in briefs, the rates were found unlawful by the Commission's hearing examiner because they are violative of Section 1(6) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.689" offset="2418730">We have set that out at page 2 of our brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.067" offset="2444225">I'm sorry, it's at page 3, the middle of the page, and it reads in part as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.218" offset="2472856">“It is hereby made the duty of all common carriers subject to the provisions of this part to establish, observe, and enforce just and reasonable classifications of property for transportation with reference to which rates, tariffs, regulations or practices are/or maybe made or prescribed in just and reasonable regulations and practices affecting classifications, rates, or tariffs.”</text>
            <text syncTime="646.745" offset="2586958">The section goes on to deal with other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.760" offset="2607020">The railroads filed exceptions to the report of the examiner and Division 2 of the Commission consisting of three commissioners of whom Commissioner Fritz dissented, held that the rates are not violative of Section 1(6) in as much as they were held to be justified by the particular circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.421" offset="2717675">Commissioner Fritz dissented upon the grounds that all freight rates or all commodity rates such as these are on straight shipments, can be justified under only special circumstances which he felt were not present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.704" offset="2790713">These appellants then petitioned the entire Commission as at that time we had a right to do for reconsideration of the report by Division 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.941" offset="2839719">In the entire Commission with three commissioners dissenting, issued its report which condemned these rates on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.919" offset="2879634">First, it was held that the rates constitute a destructive competitive practice in contravention of the National Transportation Policy and second, that the rates do violate the provisions of Section 1(6) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.406" offset="2953613">Now, these two conclusions were very intimately related and they stem, we believe, from a single basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.741" offset="2994887">That was the fact that as demonstrated by the evidence of record before the Commission, these all freight rates which have been established for the New Haven and with respect to which the evidence all related operated to hurt rather than to help the New Haven financially.</text>

            <text syncTime="852.337" offset="3409293">Now, there was no holding that this would be harmful to the motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.101" offset="3428310">We didn't litigate on that basis or at least the Commission didn't decide on that basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="868.019" offset="3471987">The Commission made two findings in connection with this ultimate conclusion and also with respect to this evidence relating to the injury to the New Haven as well as to the other carriers through the destruction of the rate structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.859" offset="3555370">The first was that the rates applied to straight car loads and displaced all other higher car load rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.142" offset="3584522">They represented the highest level, the Commission said, at which the bulk of the New Haven's westbound traffic were moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.124" offset="3616496">The second finding concerned this study which actually moved -- or of the traffic which actually moved on these all freight rates which have been referred to by the Commission in its decision as Section 2 rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.457" offset="3689744">That was by reason of fact that they were published in Section 2 of a given tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.778" offset="3715030">That study covered a period of 11 weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.501" offset="3729972">The New Haven had analyzed those shipments to determine which of them consisted the movements which they had afford in taking place by way of the New Haven itself at its preexisting rates in which have been attracted to the new Section 2 rates from some other service.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.063" offset="3832163">The study showed and the Commission found the fact that the new traffic which had been attracted by the all freight rates amounted to more than four million pounds during this 11-week period but that the total revenue for both the new and the old traffic had not appreciably increased over that which would have accrued that the old traffic been handled the old rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1619.259" offset="6477009">I stated that the Commission's cost formulas do these allocations so that you have your total railroad or portion of the total railroad cost that are allocated to carload freight rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.867" offset="6539389">Now, the formula then says that you're going to take 80% of that total and then treat it as out-of-pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.792" offset="6575125">The remaining 20% being treated as constant and the theory is that it will be incurred whether the railroad handles more or less traffic anyhow, that 20% is going to be incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.744" offset="6638968">So that put to one side, the add on I should add or state here too a return here in this out-of-pocket cost of 4% on the book value of the rolling stock and 2% on the book value of the roadway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.408" offset="6701558">They then utilize various formulae to allocate that 80% to compute out-of-pocket cost for boxcar traffic of one sort or another but two of them are just call traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.123" offset="6764460">All the rest, these are all allocations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.945" offset="6783687">Then when you come to fully distributed cost, you must add back the 20% and in addition, you must add back the deficits which the railroads have incurred by reason of their passenger service and the less than carload freight service which also incurs the deficit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.417" offset="6881593">This is the total of the constant cost that the Commission has to distribute to compute fully distributed cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.003" offset="6919941">Now, the allocation of these constant costs to the traffic for which the fully booked -- for which the out-of-pocket cost have been computed is done on an arbitrary formula, it is by tons and ton miles and produces a different result than if you allocate it on the basis of the ratio that the out-of-pocket cost had to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.400" offset="7041567">And you come out ultimately with a figure saying that the railroads must, from all of their freight traffic, and this is the important part,from all of their freight traffic, they have got to recover something substantially in excess of out-of-pocket cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.547" offset="7122129">Now, what that amounts to in the Eastern District is about 40% of the out-of-pocket cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.533" offset="7174060">In this case, the cost all related to the so-called Eastern District and not to the New Haven specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.700" offset="7206766">I believe the New Haven's constant cost would be larger because it incurs a larger deficit from passenger operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1844.288" offset="7377084">Now, bituminous coal doesn't supply anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.552" offset="7394116">You use sand and gravel or -- and we're talking all carload traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.726" offset="7418880">The result is that your boxcar traffic has to make a return of substantially greater than this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.933" offset="7451690">And when you get over then into the area of determining how much a given type of traffic should return in that excess of out-of-pocket cost in order to permit the railroads to stay financially viable, you get into an area where the pencil of the cost expert breaks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.401" offset="7557538">Because obviously, if you have a particular traffic, that can't be transported at anything like 40% in excess of out-of-pocket cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="2443.156" offset="9772617">Well again, Mr. Chief Justice, I want to make it clear that we don't pitch our case on the injury to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.436" offset="9821727">We pitch it on the fact that these rates will injure us collaterally through their violation of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.429" offset="9865613">We put our primary emphasis upon that violation that we have an interest to be sure, but the effect upon us, is a collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.580" offset="9910230">This is not an intermodal competitive case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.755" offset="9922978">That's -- we have the right to complain because our competitors violate the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.578" offset="9966237">We are injured by that violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.432" offset="9973656">That's the practical reason that we complain, but our complaint is pitched on the legal ground that they violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.370" offset="10013466">Now, I'd like to come back if I may to this matter of the cost because the Division 2 of the Commission or the court below had put a good deal of reliance upon the fact that these -- even these reduced rates do recover full cost as the Commission computes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.781" offset="10099043">But I want to emphasize that here, the court below invaded the sphere of the Commission because it is in the determination of just how much a given traffic should provide in excess of out-of-pocket costs where the administrative expertise of the Interstate Commerce Commission comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.382" offset="10209489">Now here, we think there was an invasion, an intrusion by the Court into the administrative field and we insist that the only way that the railroads can remain viable is for the Commission to exercise the administrative obligation which it has to fix these rates in relation to all of these considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.230" offset="10332891">That's what it did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.480" offset="10337907">Here, it said that Section 1(6) of the Act requires us to -- or requires the railroads to have all of its -- all of their rates in reasonable relation to each other, and where the railroads fail to do that, the very purpose of this differential pricing in order to recover the total cost is destroyed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2641.864" offset="10567367">Now, the railroads had urged that the maintenance by them of a tariff is known as the uniform freight classifications is all it's necessary to satisfy the requirements of Section 1(6).</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.624" offset="10626403">The court below said that really maintenance of these classifications which are nothing but categories of traffic by which class rates are made applicable was for the purpose of fixing maximum reasonable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.637" offset="10698501">The railroads had urged that in the court below and the court so found but the railroads now say that now it's only for class rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.789" offset="10739148">They don't have any argument anymore that it's with respect to maximum rates only.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.924" offset="10767673">They say it's only with respect to class rates and that they are -- they are useful both -- both from a standpoint of regulation of maximum as well as minimum rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.385" offset="10805499">But when they say that, they in effect read Section 1(6) virtually out of the Act because as far as class rates are concerned, only about 1% of the traffic now moves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.692" offset="10854713">And we take the position and we say under the decision of this Court in the Ann Arbor case to say that by the Commission itself that the proper interpretation of Section 1(6) is that the commodity rates likewise apply the categories of traffic the very nature of the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.800" offset="10947187">There are special ways to be sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.223" offset="10956800">But they make a separate category of traffic for -- in particular circumstance and this is true of all commodity rates at under separate or under special circumstances, particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.788" offset="11019076">The Commission has approved them because it found them to be consistent with the requirements of Section 1(6).</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.806" offset="11051154">They were just and reasonable classification of traffic for that particular circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.689" offset="11070694">The Commission said that wasn't here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4986.484" offset="19945848">I think that I should first address myself to the question which has -- have been discussed in the last five minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.878" offset="19991510">I think, Your Honors, that the District Court did decide a matter essential to its decision and a matter which was put up to it by the parties for decision namely, the applicability of Section 1(6) of the Interstate Commerce Act to these rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.466" offset="20081789">As a matter of fact Your Honors, it was the Commission's decision on that issue which caused us to take the case to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5029.898" offset="20119510">We feel so strongly that Section 1(6) was meant to apply only to class rates and that it was here distorted to apply to commodity rates and to reach a result not permitted by Section 15a(3) that we went to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.528" offset="20194011">So we submit that on that issue, there is a solid basis for the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court and that it will not simply be declaring principles for rendering an advisory opinion on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5065.119" offset="20260467">Now, as far as the value of service matter is concerned, I think there is much to what Mr. Ginnane said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.849" offset="20295367">I believe that the lower court did use language that was too broad with reference to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5080.115" offset="20320444">Certainly, it is true that some railroad rates have to be made as high as reasonably the traffic can be made to bear, and that's what value of service of course means.</text>

            <text syncTime="5094.492" offset="20377913">And I don't think it's been outlawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.090" offset="20388258">But I do not think, Your Honors, that the value of service matter was at all necessary to the lower court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.200" offset="20428800">It did not reach its opinion, I may suggest, on the basis of value of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5113.068" offset="20452206">This is what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.071" offset="20460251">It was trying to get at the Commission's motive for having invoked the classification requirement of Section 1(6) and it's simply speculated that the Commission's motive was to hold fast to the value of service principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="5134.404" offset="20537574">It said, it would appear that the Commission here invokes 1(6) as a means of preserving a basis for the value of service principle and then it went on and gave the rather broad statements to the effect that value of service was something or the past and really outlawed by the transportation policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5161.239" offset="20644885">Now, Your Honors, the same court said very much the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.937" offset="20663693">It was composed of different judges in the other New Haven case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5170.859" offset="20683337">And in that case, this is the way your court disposed of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.560" offset="20702145">You said, “The court below set out at some length its understanding of the Commission's method of arriving at carrier cost its analysis of the role of value of service concepts in ratemaking and its views of the precise circumstances under which the Commission could lawfully disallow the rates at issue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.989" offset="20795873">Then you said, “We find it unnecessary to consider that discussion in this instance since we hold only that on the present record, the disallowance of the rates in question was not adequately supported.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.995" offset="20859925">Now, I respectfully suggest to the Court that you could decide the Section 1(6) point which was basic to the lower court's decision and to the Interstate Commerce Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5227.089" offset="20908304">And you could say that as to the value of service matter, you are not passing on that and it need not be passed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.903" offset="20955533">And with those views, I should think, Mr. Chief Justice that the Court does have a basis for jurisdiction and I respectfully suggest could and should hear us on the 1(6) point -- Section 1(6) point.</text>

            <text syncTime="5503.746" offset="22014955">Well, my argument of course is on the applicability of Section 1(6) to commodity rates or I might say to non-class rates which I call commodity rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5518.868" offset="22075455">And I should like to add very briefly to the facts which have been stated to you by Mr. Carpenter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5526.783" offset="22107115">First, the New Haven relies very heavily upon the category of traffic known as manufactured and miscellaneous for the revenues necessary to operate its line.</text>
            <text syncTime="5540.511" offset="22161972">60% and more of its freight revenues come from that category of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="5547.889" offset="22191543">By reason of truck competition, both private and for hire, the long-haul traffic of the New Haven then is that originated by it then delivered to connections in this category of manufacture and miscellaneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.793" offset="22259148">It was cut in half between 1947 and 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="5571.418" offset="22285584">It dropped from 2,942,000 tons in 1947 to a 1,480,000 in 1958.</text>

            <text syncTime="5583.209" offset="22332813">It could have a total of 15 million tons in a position (Inaudible).</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward A. Kaier</label>
            <text syncTime="5592.076" offset="22368235">I don't think so, Your Honor, because it went down -- it's pretty steadily year by year in good years and bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="5602.416" offset="22409613">And then as has been told you, the New Haven was confronted with an additional competitive force, one in July 1958 competing railroads established this Plan III, trailer-on-flatcar piggyback service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5619.646" offset="22478576">As Mr. Carpenter said during the first two months that that service was in effect, the New Haven lost to the New York Central an addition -- 400 carloads of traffic from Boston to St. Louis alone and it lost additional traffic that originated at Connecticut points, was trucked to New York, there put on flatcars, and moved out by other railroads from that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5647.185" offset="22588709">So it was obvious, Your Honors, that the New Haven had to do something to meet these committed -- competitive forces that were taking its vital traffic, the traffic without which it couldn't render service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5662.032" offset="22648059">The logical thing for it to do, it concluded, was to reduce its rates for boxcar service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5670.086" offset="22680242">And this was for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5672.824" offset="22691213">First, the New Haven has a very large imbalance of movement as between loaded and empty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5682.265" offset="22729038">With a 150 cars a day moving empty from points on its line to St. Louis and Chicago where they are given over to western connections.</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.605" offset="22782328">We said 150 cars a month in our brief which I regret that is wrong, it's 150 a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="5701.413" offset="22805629">And this amounts to an unused capacity of three million tons a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="5708.428" offset="22833633">Now, the second factor which indicated that the way that New Haven should proceed was to reduce its boxcar rates, was that it had disabilities with respect to the performance of trailer-on-flatcar service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5724.940" offset="22899670">Equipment disabilities, clearance disabilities, some but not all were cleared up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5731.995" offset="22927882">By the time the Commission's decision was rendered, by no means all have been cleared up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5739.038" offset="22956095">They still have equipment difficulties and they're upgrading with the scope of being unable to handle 40-foot trailers which are very popular on 40-foot cars which is the kind that New Haven has most of.</text>
            <text syncTime="5754.838" offset="23019311">Now, since these empty cars were moving, anyway, it would of course be a very economial thing for the New Haven to transport traffic in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5766.789" offset="23067063">So it filed a reduced rates applying from New York, from New England points to the plateau places that it was delivering these empty boxcars to St. Louis and Chicago.</text>

            <text syncTime="6016.329" offset="24065254">No shipper or receiver of freight opposed the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6021.692" offset="24086674">They were opposed only by the New Haven's competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6025.802" offset="24103184">They were found to cover a fully distributed cost which means of course the cost of hauling the traffic involved plus the contribution to overheads plus the contribution to passenger deficit and less than carload deficit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6040.655" offset="24162534">Now, with those remarks, I should like to discuss the applicability of Section 1(6) to these rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6050.092" offset="24200359">Class rates are applied to traffic by means of two separate tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6059.012" offset="24235990">One is called the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="6062.602" offset="24250305">And in the classification, virtually all articles of commerce are assigned to one or another of the classes which are about 31 in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="6076.625" offset="24306416">No rates are specified in that tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="6080.929" offset="24323657">Then there's another tariff called the class rate tariff in which the rates in cents per hundred pounds are set forth between all points roughly east to the Rocky Mountains and they show the rate applicable on each of the classes made in the classification tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="6106.515" offset="24426057">The class rates are established independent of the articles upon which they will apply and the classification is established independent of the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6121.908" offset="24487602">Now, commodity rates in contrast are made specifically applicable to a mean commodity or group of commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6132.372" offset="24529398">With respect to these commodity rates, therefore, the function which is indispensable in applying a class rate to a given shipment that of assigning the article to a given classification simply does not take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="6150.423" offset="24601600">Now, it is obvious that even though a class rate may be entirely reasonable, a shipper can be hurt, can be charged an excessive rate or a rate which is improperly related to another commodity or to a rate on another commodity by the classification into which his article is placed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6174.926" offset="24699611">With respect to things which move under class rates, therefore, it was thought necessay that there'd be legal protection of the act of classifying, making the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="6191.206" offset="24764813">And therefore, Section 1(6) of the Act which enjoins upon the carriers to establish just and reasonable classification with reference to which rates are or maybe made shall be established and it prohibited every unjust and unreasonable classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="6219.422" offset="24877662">In the case of commodity rates, however, Section 1(6) would serve no purpose, not served by other sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6229.025" offset="24916010">If a rate is too high, it is unlawful under Section 15(1) which prohibits unreasonable rates and the Commission may reduce it under Section 15(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="6241.190" offset="24964702">If it is improperly related to another rate, it is unduly prejudicial under Section 3 and the Commission may reduce it -- may correct the relationship under Section 15(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="6254.941" offset="25019664">If it is too low, the Commission may find it unreasonable under Section 1 as supplemented by the National Transportation Policy and 15a(2) and enter a minimum rate order under Section 15(1), so that every situation, with respect to commodity rates, is covered by these other sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6284.391" offset="25137528">Now, Your Honors at the time the Interstate Commerce Act was passed in 1887 most traffic moved on class rates and there was complaint to the Committee which was considering the Interstate Commerce Act Cullom Committee that people were being injured by improper classification or by diversity of the classification that was one in the east called the official classification, one in the south and one in the west, an individual carriers have their own classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="6318.142" offset="25272529">But the Cullom Committee did not give the Commission the power to prescribe rates and it said nothing about classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="6327.523" offset="25310041">In the Hepburn Act of 1906, the Commission was given the power to fix a rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6334.721" offset="25338880">Therefore, it could just declare it unreasonable then it would have to go into Court and get the aid of a court to enjoin -- enforce its orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="6343.247" offset="25372944">The Hepburn Act of 1906 gave the Commission the power to prescribe rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6349.688" offset="25398648">But this was thought to be inadequate since the amount of transportation charges could be affected by a change in classification as well as the change in rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6362.575" offset="25450266">Now, I submit that the legislative history shows very clearly that the purpose of 1(6) is to govern the applica -- to -- to command reasonable as of classification for use in connection with class rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6381.246" offset="25524976">The Senate -- a report of the senate bill stated some doubt has been raised as to whether under the provisions of Section 15 of the existing Act the Commission is empowered to review classification of freight as well as rates and to make orders dealing with improper classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="6401.844" offset="25607314">By Section 9 of the bill, this doubt is removed and the power is expressly vested in the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6409.597" offset="25638348">Similarly, Mr. Russell, a member of the House Committee which is in-charge of the bill stated that he had been informed and I quote, “The shipper can be extorted from, he can be made to pay an unjust rate just as well through classifications as he can through the fixing of a rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6428.975" offset="25715879">The carrier can put the article in one classification subject to a given rate and if the ICC sees fit to declare that rate unreasonable and reduce it declaring much over the reasonable rate to take its place that carrying corporation can obtain the same benefit and put the shipper under the same disadvantage by simply changing the classification of the freight.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6456.866" offset="25827370">And then Mr. Mann, Senator Mann, the chairman of the committee and the man who's named the bill bears stated that classification of freight is just as important as rates because by moving a particular article from one class to another, you affect the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6477.867" offset="25911380">So I submit that this congressional history clearly shows that the problem that Congress was trying to solve by the enactment of Section 1(6) was the problem of ensuring reasonable classification for use in connection with class rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6495.649" offset="25982537">The first important case after the enactment of 1(6) was the western classification case decided in 1912.</text>
            <text syncTime="6504.634" offset="26018482">And there, the Commission stated and I quote, “At the present time, the three great classifications official flying in the east, western and southern subject to exception sheets and commodity rates are the only classifications applying to interstate traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="6526.593" offset="26106358">And these three classifications, the only ones applying to interstate traffic applied only in fixing classification ratings for use in connection with class rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6541.694" offset="26166753">And in that same case, the Commission said this and I think it is highly significant and I would like to quote it, it's just about five lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="6551.000" offset="26203951">“Classification is an art or science in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6555.391" offset="26221505">The correct method of procedure,” I'm doing a little skipping here but it doesn't change the substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6560.670" offset="26242612">“The correct method of procedure is that the uniform classification must be worked out without an attempt to affect revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="6570.129" offset="26280438">Classification and rates and revenues should be kept entirely separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6576.385" offset="26305515">It would only complicate and confuse matters to attempt through the instrumentality of the classification to bring about a revision in rates and charges whether a rate is too high or too low should be made a separate and distinct issue from classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="6596.948" offset="26387749">It seems very clear, therefore, that the Commission considered classification of freight as something to be used in connection with the application of class rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6608.664" offset="26434560">It could hardly have considered reasonable classification requirement of 1(6) to apply to commodity rates and yet say as it did that classification and rates should be kept entirely separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6626.378" offset="26505509">Even in the present case, Your Honors, the examiner who held against us apparently could not get out of his mind that classification within 1(6) is that applying to class rates for he said, “The examiner finds and concludes that the rates tend to vitiate and undermine the Uniform Freight Classification which I interpolate is something applying to class rates in violation of Section 1(6) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6663.962" offset="26655765">The rates he said undermine and tend to vitiate and tend undermine the Uniform Freight Classification.</text>

            <text syncTime="6726.371" offset="26905391">A decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission passing upon the lawfulness of all commodity rates under Section 1(6) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6737.351" offset="26949381">And I think that the position that 1(6) is violated by all commodity rates is best summed up by quoting a sentence from the dissenting opinion of Commissioner Alldredge.</text>
            <text syncTime="6754.286" offset="27017091">Commissioner Alldredge was the great champion of the idea that the reasonable classification provision applied not only in connection with class rates but commodity rates as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="6768.573" offset="27074247">And he said, “The significance of classification should be considered in its broadest sense that is as furnishing a comprehensive basis system with the distribution of the general rate burden and the establishment of rate relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6786.124" offset="27144464">And so regarded it necessarily embraces commodity rates as well as so called class rates.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6794.211" offset="27176751">The majority of the Commission answered this by stating, “Respondents now maintain a full line of class rates in governed by the western classification from and to all points involved in this proceeding as required by Section 1(6) of the Interstate Commerce Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6816.183" offset="27264731">And then a little bit later it said, “Class rates normally reflect the maximum of reasonableness on good falling within the various classes of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="6826.781" offset="27307050">Commodity rates are established” and then I'm skipping a little bit “when circumstances and conditions suggest the class basis is too high for application on the traffic.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6839.369" offset="27357414">And then this very significant statement, “We have approved this basis of ratemaking and have never required commodity rate to conform to the ratings of the classification.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6852.570" offset="27410181">A little later on it said, “All rates are required to be just and reasonable, nondiscriminatory and non-prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6861.919" offset="27447589">To require carriers to maintain rates only on a classification basis would make Section 1(6) paramount to all other sections of the Act.”</text>

            <text syncTime="7056.339" offset="28225306">But a careful reading of the cases that it cites on that proposition will show that in doing so, it was applying the provisions of Section 1(5) as to reasonable rates, Section 2 as to unjust discrimination, or Section 3 as to undue prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="7076.882" offset="28307435">And in none of them did it rely upon Section 1(6) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7083.579" offset="28334289">I believe that this is the first case in which the entire Commission has applied Section 1(6) to commodity rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="7092.955" offset="28371801">There are two decisions of the division three -- division two of the Commission in which 1(6) was invoke against commodity rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="7104.325" offset="28417254">And those are very interesting for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="7107.446" offset="28429688">As I have said District Commissioner Alldredge was the great champion of the idea that 1(6) applied to commodity as well as class rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="7117.230" offset="28468872">He didn't persuade anybody, any of his colleagues that that was so except Commissioner Johnson.</text>

            <text syncTime="7136.061" offset="28544209">But other than those, I think there are no decisions holding 1(6) applicable to commodity rates although it's been on the books since 1910.</text>

            <text syncTime="7167.219" offset="28668865">We have now enacted by Congress, Section 15a(3), the object of which was to give the railroads greater freedom in making competitive rates and to indicate the rules which should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="7184.530" offset="28738038">And that is to say that they could meet competition and make rates lower as low as they wanted to regarded as necessary to meet the competition provided they didn't take away an inherent advantage of one of the competing carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="7201.266" offset="28805016">Now, of course, the railroads drill for a long time to get that legislation and here it is just fresh on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="7212.905" offset="28851618">And the Commission invokes Section 1(6) and says, “Now, in addition to meeting the requirements that you have always had to meet, in addition to meeting the standards of Section 15a(3) recently enacted, you must now also meet classification principles.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7233.096" offset="28932284">Now, classification principles have taken a rather classic form in which certain elements are considered, one of which is value of the commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="7245.477" offset="28981812">And the idea has been that value of the commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="7249.145" offset="28996545">It means that something of high value can take higher rates and something of low value will take lower rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="7257.567" offset="29030191">And of course that was all well and good when the railroads had a monopoly and the man had to ship by railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="7264.136" offset="29056522">But if you tell a man that now, he'll go around the corner to see a trucker and if he can't get what he wants from the trucker, he'll buy a truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="7273.792" offset="29095079">And he can hold diamonds in that truck just as cheaply as he can call coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="7279.227" offset="29116813">And I don't want to get into discussion of value of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="7283.010" offset="29131964">But I believe that that is what the District Court had in mind when it was talking about value of service here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7289.773" offset="29159027">That is to say value of the commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="7292.630" offset="29170416">But at all events, our fear is that if the Commission imposes the requirement that in judging the lawfulness of competitive rates, it's going to judge them also by whether they conformed to classification principles were going to be met with a frustration of the purpose of Section 15a(3) because the Commission will condemn them, because they don't confrm to classification practices and say, “Oh yes, if they are right under 15a(3) but basically they don't conform to something that for years we've been doing” namely applying classification principles.</text>

            <text syncTime="7394.323" offset="29577195">Now, the classification was something that applied all over a territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="7399.453" offset="29597780">For example here in the East, Mr. Commissioner, the official classification applied just about from the Atlantic Sea Board to the Mississippi River and North of the Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="7409.466" offset="29637799">Now, fixed the classification rating for that whole territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="7414.137" offset="29656503">Between certain points from the territory there may have been need by reason of some competitive factor to make a lower rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7421.302" offset="29685133">So instead of dislodging the classification applying generally, they just made a commodity rate to apply between those points.</text>
            <text syncTime="7432.730" offset="29730900">Now, the government attempts to distinguish All Freight to the Pacific Coast on the ground that's the -- all commodity rates in effect there or approved there were higher than the individual rates on individual commodities embraced within the all commodity group.</text>
            <text syncTime="7459.903" offset="29839569">And I submit that that is really a very superficial distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="7467.256" offset="29868931">It seems to me that the idea that an all commodity rate does not offend classification principles if it is higher than the individual rates on individual commodities completely overlooks the fact that the individual rates themselves were made without reference to classification principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="7493.900" offset="29975510">So I submit that that is no distinction at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="7496.609" offset="29986377">And moreover, the Commission's reference to the fact in its decision was to distinguish two other cases on the grounds of undue preference and prejudice and have nothing whatever to do with the application of Section 1(6).</text>
            <text syncTime="7516.754" offset="30066939">So I submit, if You Honors please, that commodity rates are not within the purpose of Section 1(6) in the Commission's decisions up to this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="7710.170" offset="30840581">Now I think or for furthermore, there are -- in fact there are no findings whatever in their report to support its finding of destructive competitive practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="7719.376" offset="30877466">Now, I think a brief examination, and I'll attempt to make it as brief as possible, of the record will show this.</text>
            <text syncTime="7727.545" offset="30910171">It shows first that the New Haven had in mind in publishing in Section 2, all commodity rates two things and I think that Mr. Kaier covered this.</text>
            <text syncTime="7736.391" offset="30945489">I would like to cover it very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="7739.478" offset="30957819">First, to fill up about 150 boxcars which were moving each day empty westbound.</text>
            <text syncTime="7746.710" offset="30986762">Secondly, it hoped to prevent the erosion of its boxcar traffic to motor carriers on one hand and to the Plane III carriers on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="7756.154" offset="31024588">Now, certainly the Plan III piggyback and I think this is well established -- was established to comeback motor carrier competition both regulated and unregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="7767.168" offset="31068578">Therefore when we are attempting in our boxcar rates to meet Plan III this doesn't mean that we're meeting other rail competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="7773.079" offset="31092297">It means we are trying to adjust our boxcar rates to accommodate motor carrier competition already being met by Plan III piggyback.</text>
            <text syncTime="7782.106" offset="31128346">Now, it should be noted in the record -- I will -- should have noted that the record shows that after 76 days of operation, the New Haven's new rate schedule had attracted only about three cars per day average of new traffic and that be attracted from the trucks only about one car a day to fill up the 150 which we had available.</text>
            <text syncTime="7804.244" offset="31216953">Now, this performance, it has to be admitted, shows something less than an overwhelming success as a result of our rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="7812.419" offset="31249659">And perhaps this may show that the rates aren't low enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="7815.964" offset="31263765">It certainly doesn't support a finding of destructive competitive practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="7991.173" offset="31964682">We have a large number of 40-foot flatcars which are the old type and which trailers are still loaded on, even though there are two trailers for shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="8000.128" offset="32000418">They use one trailer to a flat car in many instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="8005.747" offset="32022988">Now, in 1958 and this goes to the construction of the rates, what the rates actually did, how we approach this problem of attempting to fill the 150 empty boxcars and prevent erosion to the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="8020.203" offset="32080771">In 1958, practically all eastern carriers and I think this has been covered before, I'll keep it brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="8026.167" offset="32104594">Practically, all eastern carriers faced a serious erosion of traffic to highway carriers both regulated and unregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="8034.947" offset="32139703">And that during that same year the Transportation Act of 1958 was passed and as a result of that legislation, the eastern blinds were encouraged to expand on a -- an old form of trailer- on-flatcar service, and this was known as Plan III which Mr. Carpenter has already explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="8061.234" offset="32244924">I think that just in brief, I will explain that the piggyback rates apply on two trailers, moving in the same shipment not necessarily on the same flatcar within the same shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="8072.793" offset="32291109">A maximum loading is permitted of 70,000 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="8079.459" offset="32317753">The rates are the same for the shipment regardless of the character of traffic in the boxcar or in the trailers, or regardless of the weight less than 70,000 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="8091.478" offset="32365819">It's irrelevant to this discussion that there is an excess charge for over seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="8097.808" offset="32391210">At any rate this is the type of rate which has been in existence for sometime, it was an existence at the time that we were establishing our Section 2, all commodity rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="8110.666" offset="32442619">And these had to be a consideration in establishing our rates and in determining a level at which those rates would be established our Section 2 or commodity rates and these had to be a consideration in establishing our rates and in determining the level at which those rates would be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="8118.955" offset="32475742">And incidentally I'm not sure if this was set.</text>
            <text syncTime="8121.762" offset="32487027">The Plan III service and charges had been approved by the Commission and Eastern Central Motor Carriers v. Baltimore and Ohio, reported 314 I.C.C. 5, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="8132.538" offset="32530077">And the decision of the three-judge court upholding the Commission in 226 Fd. Supp. 318 was affirmed by this Court in Cooper-Jarrett v. United States, number 159 of this term.</text>
            <text syncTime="8145.199" offset="32580754">So in 1959, when the Section 2 rates were being formulated, it was clear that in a new pricing approach, had to be resolved with a key in hand of those rates with the existing Section 3 or Plan III piggyback rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="8165.241" offset="32660898">Now, along this line, there have been -- and I think this was mentioned I don't know to what extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="8175.258" offset="32701022">There were in existence in the time our Section 2 rates were established, also Section 1 rates and these likewise were on all commodity freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="8185.373" offset="32741460">They were -- one rate however from Boston to Chicago the level of the rate was I believe $2.13 cents per 100 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="8195.526" offset="32782002">For a shipment, a minimum weight of shipment of 30,000 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="8200.449" offset="32801750">However, because of a various fringe benefits in connection with those rates, the average car loading was about 20,000 pounds per car on a shipment of Section 1 of all commodity rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="8216.920" offset="32867579">Now, the rates which we have here are here in issue are constructed on the one end.</text>
            <text syncTime="8226.468" offset="32905822">You will notice they are made of a scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="8228.493" offset="32913972">There's a rate (Inaudible) to lowering the scale add more to a shipping weight of 20,000 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="8234.869" offset="32939468">That rate is the same as the Section 1 or substantially the same as a Section 1 all commodity rate, which has been in existence for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="8243.464" offset="32973845">Now, it went down to the other end of this scale where 70,000-pound rates, and that is the same as the Plan III rates on a 70,000-pounds shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="8255.145" offset="33020552">But it's higher to the extent that a shipper would pay in addition to the Plan III rate, a pickup and delivery charge or cost that either end of the terminal -- at either terminal both in origin and destination.</text>
            <text syncTime="8278.772" offset="33115011">Now, in the center of the -- of the scale of rates, we have of course some 10,000 pounds increments rates on 20,000, 30,000, 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 and 70,000 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="8289.343" offset="33157329">In the center of the 30,000-pound rates on this scale which is here involved, were made somewhat higher, slightly higher, and this is shown in exhibit 22 Page 176 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="8304.102" offset="33216366">They're slightly higher than the motor carrier 30,000-pound rates on most commodities which are shown in that exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="8312.681" offset="33250638">Our 40,000-pound rates, this is of course would create an incentive, were slightly lower than the range of 30,000-pound motor carrier rates shown in that exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="8322.460" offset="33289822">Now, this is not entirely a consistent pattern but it is consistent as with possible in establishing a single level of rates based on shipping weights.</text>
            <text syncTime="8339.991" offset="33359935">Now I like to mention this that the charge for a 50,000-pound shipment from Boston to Chicago in Plan III would be $494.50 cents as compared with a charge for a similar shipment in boxcars under Section 2 of $530.</text>
            <text syncTime="8362.732" offset="33450841">So, these are related.</text>
            <text syncTime="8364.981" offset="33459827">You have then the Section 2 rates tied in with -- with your Plan III piggyback.</text>
            <text syncTime="8371.976" offset="33487830">Now, it's entirely clear, I think, that because we had published our Plan III rates at levels which were hidden with -- which were competitive with motor carriers, and particularly with unregulated private truckers, we could expect our closely related boxcar rates to capture some truck traffic and in effect, in fact this did happen as the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="8395.711" offset="33582811">Now, although not -- though it was not conclusive, we also presented the Commission some figures, the only ones available, to show a trend under the new schedules, and those are the ones shown on page 12 of the record which were in the Commission's final report.</text>
            <text syncTime="8413.169" offset="33652611">Now, all the exhibit shows on its face and these may be partly in response to Mr. Justice White's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="8421.049" offset="33684167">In my mind is that the new schedules are effective in attracting some truck traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="8427.405" offset="33709558">To what extent they have retained traffic, we can't say.</text>
            <text syncTime="8431.250" offset="33724918">We think they were somewhat successful in that regard at least they carried some traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="8438.919" offset="33755638">In order to provide and I'd like to -- to quickly go through this.</text>
            <text syncTime="8443.936" offset="33775700">In order to provide the Commission with a comparison of earnings, the New Haven's witness prepared Exhibit 28, that's at page 200 of the record which shows the times that tonnages and earning under the new rates and then re-rated them the same tonnages using the old rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="8460.228" offset="33840901">Now, they used two assumptions, first, that the volume would be the same and this is in response to Mr. Justice White's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="8467.518" offset="33870054">They assumed that the volume of traffic would be the same as under the old rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="8472.145" offset="33888549">And they also assumed that the same number of boxcars would be required to handle that traffic as under the new rates, even though -- even though under the new rates the average loading was quite high.</text>
            <text syncTime="8484.899" offset="33939540">Now it's made of -- it's quite clear in the record that the comparison couldn't be taken as an accurate measure of improved revenues, and certainly I -- I think that in our discussion this is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="8492.836" offset="33971304">And certainly, it couldn't be taken as a measure of net revenues because the service performed under the old rates was quite a bit different and more extensive than under the new.</text>
            <text syncTime="8508.656" offset="34034521">And again, we didn't know how much traffic we'd move would be retained under the -- under the old rates if they had been on effect rather than the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="8516.488" offset="34065868">Now, as to the possible increase in that revenues, the cost of handling a traffic at the old Section 1 rates, were greater because the number of boxcars needed were -- were -- a greater number of boxcars were needed to handle the same amount of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="8529.619" offset="34118426">The Commission statement in the report, therefore, at page 12, as to the four million pounds for additional $129 is wholly without meaning, and nevertheless the -- appellants rely on this to show destructive competitive practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="8548.832" offset="34195226">Now, if the Commission had intended to support its finding, it would had to reconcile several other things and quickly they would had -- they would have had to justify its approving the Plan III piggyback rates, which would have produced and this is shown in our record at page 201.</text>
            <text syncTime="8565.462" offset="34261786">It would produced if the same traffic which moved into 76 days had then -- had moved in Plan III piggyback, it would have accrued $1200 less revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="8576.436" offset="34305672">Now, this isn't disturbing to us because the cost of piggyback is different, and the service is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="8583.648" offset="34334511">Now next, the Commission must have seen in the record that an average of only three cars per day were moving under the Section 2 rates, the same time 34 cars per day were moving under the old Section 1 rates just between Boston and Chicago, and this is shown in the printed record 199.</text>
            <text syncTime="8602.563" offset="34410162">So this clearly shows a lack of validity in the Commission's fear that Section 1 rates or Section 2 rates would destroy the rate structure and that traffic moving under Section 2 would constitute the bulk of the freight moving out of the lines of the New Haven and to the points involved in the tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="8621.248" offset="34484976">Now, one final thing, the question of net revenue under the new rates was raised, the assumption that the traffic would have moved in one boxcar and under the old rates for every boxcar under the new rates is shown to be erroneous in the record that -- well I can't put my finger on the record reference, but there is a -- a reference in the record showing that the average rate or the average number of cars under the old rate of Section 1 was two per shipment and the average was about 20,000 pounds per shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="8665.564" offset="34662191">Now, if we then recalculate the cost of moving the two boxcars under the old rates for every boxcar under the new rates, we will find that the New Haven actually has save itself from $18,000 out-of-pocket loss, whereas that the -- the record shows that it actually did gain $36,000 above out-of-pocket costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="8696.814" offset="34787161">Now, I think that in conclusion I -- I had said enough to indicate that the record is completely clear to show that the New Haven and its connections achieve the rates that are here involved into the existing rate structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="8713.337" offset="34853303">I think there is no question that a whole lot of traffic is not moving under these rates, we can't blame that.</text>
            <text syncTime="8720.289" offset="34881097">However, I think that indicates that it is a pragmatic test.</text>
            <text syncTime="8723.683" offset="34894681">I think that indicates that the rates are not destructively -- a destructive competitive practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="8730.228" offset="34920908">In a sense we wish that there was more indication that this solved but we simply aren't moving enough traffic for the Commission to have found that the rates constituted destructive competitive practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="9263.342" offset="37053336">And I think it is supported by a good many and of the opinions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9272.672" offset="37090638">There is one area in which we agree with the railroad appellees here.</text>
            <text syncTime="9278.827" offset="37115298">We think this case is right for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="9282.860" offset="37131389">We think that the value of service concept was injected into the case by the court below, and we know it was not relied upon by the Commission in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="9296.015" offset="37184052">We repeat that we deal with it and -- or that the Commission should deal with it if it wants to in the future, in a case where it is the central issue in the case not in this where it is at best a peripheral matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="9312.985" offset="37251866">There are two bases for the Commission's decision, the destruct -- destructive competitive practice to which I've already referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="9321.106" offset="37284362">And I want to point out that in that respect, the court below stated that the Commission had brought that issue in under Section 15a(3) and the Court was plainly wrong because the only way it gets in to Section 15a(3) is by reference to the National Transportation Policy and the National Transportation Policy came into the Act 18 years before 15a(3) was added to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="9350.266" offset="37400973">As a matter of fact, the National Transportation Policy had a predecessor in the Motor Carrier Act in 1935, this destructive competitive practice provision and applied them just to the motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="9362.939" offset="37451755">It wasn't until 1940 that it was made applicable to the -- to the entire Act and by its own terms permeates the entire Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="9369.129" offset="37476415">And as this Court has said in the Schaffer case is the yardstick by which you measure the correctness of the Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="9382.133" offset="37528451">Now, with respect to Section 1(6), I would like to point out again in response to a question asked by Mr. Justice White, the rates here, these all commodity rates which are in essence any commodity rates in as much as they don't apply on any, or if they don't require a mixture are measured by the Commission itself by reference to the class rates, the highest one that is assessed is 45% of first class and the lowest 19% of first class.</text>
            <text syncTime="9424.209" offset="37696784">I unfortunately didn't address very many on my earlier remarks to Section 1(6).</text>
            <text syncTime="9430.662" offset="37722593">I would like at this time to adopt the argument of the government at pages 9 to 18 of its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="9438.779" offset="37755089">It's a very lawyer-like presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="9442.323" offset="37769195">And I'd like to read very briefly from that because there was an early case in which the Commission did apply this principle of classification as used in 1(6) to commodity rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="9460.153" offset="37840562">And it is in the rates on Lumber and Lumber Products 52 I.C.C. 598 at page 15 of the government brief, where the -- where the Commission said, a classification of given articles is effected by a determination of the rate relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="9478.388" offset="37913496">In a measure, this is true when articles are grouped together under a commodity description in a commodity tariff, as well as when they are included in official western or southern classification.</text>
