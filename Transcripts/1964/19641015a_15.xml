            <label>Mr. Arnold Ordman</label>
            <text syncTime="41.122" offset="164467">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.020" offset="168020">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.723" offset="194873">That court denied enforcement to a Board order which directed reinstatement with back pay of two employees who have been discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.573" offset="242207">The question presented for resolution by this Court is whether an employer may lawfully discharge employees who are engaging in activities protected by the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.434" offset="301662">In this case, the activity was soliciting employees for membership in the union, whether you may discharge such employees lawfully, merely because he has a mistaken belief that in the course of that protected activity, the employees engaged in certain misconduct which would have justified the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.208" offset="392777">The Board held that the mistaken belief did not exonerate the employer and the court below held that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.855" offset="423393">The facts are simple and undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.124" offset="436454">The company was a Florida corporation engaged in business in Melbourne, Florida where it manufactured and sold concrete products.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.339" offset="473339">The employees of the company were not organized but in September of 1961, the employees engaged in a walkout in support of a demand for wage increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.442" offset="521718">Among the leaders of this walkout were the two employees who was discharged and we're concerned about here named Harmon and Davis and a third employee named McKnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.734" offset="562887">The walkout and the wage dispute were soon resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.914" offset="575634">The employees went back to work but not long thereafter, Davis, Harmon and McKnight were discharged allegedly for lack of work with the understanding that if that be recalled as soon as the volume of work resumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.384" offset="649509">Now, the Board found in this case that this layoff, that the alleged lack of work was a pretext and actually the three employees were laid off because they engaged in union activity and the court below accepted that finding and that part of the court case is not before this Court but it serves to explain the events which immediately followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.264" offset="745012">McKnight, the third employee was put back to work in normal force but Davis and Harmon were never brought back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.072" offset="780225">It seems that right after the wage dispute, Davis went to a local union affiliated with the Teamsters and an organizational campaign started in attempt to organize a campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.626" offset="830485">But Davis and Harmon were very active in the organizational campaign and solicited employees at their homes for membership in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.038" offset="864131">Now, one of the employees solicited was a fellow named Pate.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.510" offset="885969">He orally reported to the superintendent of the company and in turn reported to the manager that Davis and Harmon had come to his home and had solicited his membership in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.808" offset="943229">But in the course of that solicitation, he said, one of them threatened that he was going to -- that if the union did not get in -- get into the plant, one of them was going to dynamite the gravel bins in the plant and make it impossible for anybody to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.761" offset="1011043">Now, when the company got this information, it was understandably disturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.231" offset="1028911">There was consultation with counsel and about 12 days later in the presence of company counsel, the company got a statement under oath, an affidavit from this employee named Pate in which in substance he repeated what he had stated in the oral report.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.073" offset="1096202">But with the discrepancy about whether Davis or Harmon had made the threat but I do not think that is material here.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.171" offset="1124624">Again, the company took no further action thereafter for two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.319" offset="1145208">They got the sworn affidavit on October 25th.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.920" offset="1159628">Two weeks later on November 8th, the company manager sent letters of discharge to the two employees, Davis and Harmon saying in essence, we had laid you off last September with the understanding that once business picked up, we'd put you back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.473" offset="1225874">But business has picked up but we are not going to put you back to work because in the words of the manager in the letter, says, “It has come to my attention that you made or condoned serious threats to damage property of the company should the union fail to win the election.”</text>
            <text syncTime="325.612" offset="1302361">Now, from the company's point of view, if the Court please, this threat was a very serious threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.858" offset="1327334">Threat to dynamite is serious and it was maybe more serious because as the company knew Harmon, one of the two employees involved, had even had a little experience on the job of working with a dynamite.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.302" offset="1385117">But other than obtaining a sworn affidavit from Pate, from this employee who made the oral report, the company made no investigation of the matter whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.790" offset="1427122">It didn't inquire from Harmon and Davis as to whether they have made the threat and it didn't initiate any investigation of any kind that even a police investigation which as respondent tells us in his brief might have been justified because this was a felony, threatening to blow up the plant was a felony under Florida law punishable by 20 years -- as much as a 20-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.139" offset="1524506">Now, the only action he did take 10 days after they receive the report and after -- two weeks after they received the statement under oath was to write a letter of discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.180" offset="1572676">Now, I almost wanted to comment in a lighter vain whether this was a kind of course -- whether this course of conduct is way of handling the threat was exactly the way to win friends or influence dynamite as might leave some doubt at least in a serious way.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.603" offset="1642371">A threat to dynamite a plant is so serious as to suggest that maybe more serious measures should have been taken if the security of the plant was to be --</text>

            <text syncTime="459.813" offset="1839229">It predicated explaining on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.031" offset="1848111">The first one was that the discharge by the employer was in essence that it was agreed that the threat that the company seized upon the threat is a pretext, so that wasn't its real reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.671" offset="1898684">The Board found as one of its grounds that the threat being a pretext.</text>

            <text syncTime="842.658" offset="3370632">The employees were engaged in here with soliciting union membership which falls as we see it within the specific rubric of Section 7 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.817" offset="3407203">In other words, there is a guaranteed right to employees to “form, join or assist labor organizations”.</text>

            <text syncTime="887.178" offset="3548682">Now, the remaining unfair labor practice provisions are just tailor-made provisions designed to reach specific kinds of violations that the Congress was concerned about but Section 8 (a) (1) subsumes them all.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.332" offset="3609287">Now, in this case, we don't think we have to reach even Section 8 (a) (3), which says you can't discriminate against an employee to encourage or discourage membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.189" offset="3648679">We think 8 (a) (1) is enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="925.975" offset="3703850">If these individuals had been discharged for engaging in solicitation of union membership, the violation would have been clear, we'd have no argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.360" offset="3741362">This was I guess what the -- and not what this Court decided in the Republic Aviation case in 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.292" offset="3773127">But the respondent argues, we didn't discharge these people for engaging solicitation, we discharged them for threatening to dynamite the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.528" offset="3810011">But when we examined the facts, we find that the dynamiting did not take -- the threat had not been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.989" offset="3835925">If the threat had been made and in the posture of the case has, we have it here before this Court, the Board would have found no unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.652" offset="3874586">It would have applied the test this Court laid down in Republic mainly where you must weigh, first, the statutory rights of the employees to engage in organizational activity as against the countervailing interest of the employer, his undisputed interest to protect his property or to maintain discipline in his operation to safeguard his business operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.553" offset="3970194">But we have here only one half of the equation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1327.962" offset="5311843">The respondent points out that these two individuals received a letter saying they threatened to blow up the plant did not respond to the letter and seeks to rely upon this because innocent people would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.758" offset="5351027">The record is clear incidentally, before these two employees received this letter saying they threatened to blow up the plant, they had already heard rumors about this accusation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.793" offset="5391151">And as a matter of fact they had already talked to a government -- to a Board investigator who was investigating unfair labor practice charges connected with the earlier layoff and he had asked them about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.486" offset="5437858">They have denied the story and as they testified at the hearing, when asked about answering the letter, they said in effect, “You know we told the government investigator about this and we sort of felt that we ought to leave this to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.064" offset="5484251">We didn't think we ought to do anything further.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.246" offset="5492924">The evidence, Mr. Chief Justice was solely the oral report by Pate, where the company relied on in the sworn affidavit which they got 12 days later on the basis of which two weeks later, they sent the letters of discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.423" offset="5557603">Now, as I say Cusano and we feel that we can rely surely on Section 1, the protection of the statute from the weight of these countervailing interests and Section 8 (a) (1) covers this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.106" offset="5604415">We don't think we have to reach Section 8 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.210" offset="5616744">The respondent places its entire case and I think the court below on the lack of motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.923" offset="5639628">Motivation is more typical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.623" offset="5646420">It's the typical thing in an 8 (a) (3) case but we suggest that this Court has in a number of cases not found it necessary to find specific proof of anti-union motivation even in 8 (a) (3) cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.306" offset="5705143">Now, Cusano and Industrial Cotton, the two cases upon which we rely heavily, this Court has several times cited those cases on the proposition that's of specific proof of a discriminatory motivation is not required, necessarily required, for a Section 8 (a) (3) finding I have referenced to Republic itself to gain news which this Court -- which this Court decided together with Radio Officers and to a recent case of Erie Resistor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.664" offset="5822589">I believe this Court has in effect held as the Board has held that where there is a -- where the discharges or other discrimination arise out of unnecessary connection with a protected labor activity that a sufficient nexus has been established to justify a finding of Section 8 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.552" offset="5910152">So I would conclude by saying, we rely on I think 8 (a) (1) of the statutory guaranty as a complete substantiation of our case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1497.058" offset="5988206">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I think there is a real good reason, Mr. Justice Brennan why the Board in this case didn't seek review of anything except the good faith fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.986" offset="6043899">This -- this is somewhat unusual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.239" offset="6056856">The Trial Examiner, Mr. Wheatley completely vindicated the company and recommended dismissal of the complaint in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.740" offset="6098860">Curiously enough, Mr. Wheatley is also the Trial Examiner and tried Cusano, Industrial Cotton and Rubin Brothers, the three main cases in this area of a good faith defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.342" offset="6145358">This is the same man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.682" offset="6150687">He tried the other three cases and found that the good faith belief was not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.146" offset="6176496">But in this case, he heard the whole case and recommended that the complaint be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.273" offset="6197081">I think under this Court's rule in Universal Camera, the lower court certainly was entitled to consider not only the Board's finding which I think was wrong in reversing the Trial Examiner but in -- and to consider the Trial Examiner's report, he had the witnesses before him, he made certain findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.878" offset="6267507">He for instance did not make a finding that the threats never were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.629" offset="6286420">He didn't have to go that far because he found there was no violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.270" offset="6301048">It's an interesting question too why Pate was not called.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.960" offset="6315781">I didn't try the case, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.991" offset="6323931">I know a lawyer in my office tried it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.932" offset="6335634">We tried the case on the theory of Rubin Brothers so it didn't make any difference whether Pate had told or whether he had been threatened about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.178" offset="6360712">That's what we were told.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.615" offset="6366459">But this cuts two weights as counsel for the Board, general --distinguished General Counsel has said, the Board didn't call him either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.299" offset="6405120">General Counsel didn't call him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.237" offset="6408882">The man was sitting there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.176" offset="6412643">No one called him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.435" offset="6417659">Now, an advantage to the Court and I know of nothing to do but apologize, there's a serious mistake in our brief on page 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.057" offset="6460186">We quote Cusano as being a case involving the discharge of a striker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.922" offset="6479621">That's incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.062" offset="6484219">It was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.275" offset="6489025">I certainly must apologize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.651" offset="6502504">I will distinguish the case however.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.612" offset="6510446">Now as I think it's clear at this point, remember one question properly I submit before the Court and that is whether it's an unfair labor practice for an employer to discharge an employee who is engaged in solicitation for union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.030" offset="6572095">We call them mistaken but good faith belief that the employees threatened to dynamite the plant during the course of this union solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.801" offset="6607203">I think the counsel for petitioner has made a fair statement of the facts with the additions I made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.108" offset="6636356">One, if the Trial Examiner recommended complete dismissal and found no violation and this with an experienced Trial Examiner who heard the other good faith belief cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.939" offset="7371755">Now, the Board has argued in this belief and as argued here that this employee didn't do enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.028" offset="7396101">I submit what more can the employer do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.685" offset="7402684">There are only three people involved, the man who was threatened and the two men who threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.582" offset="7418253">We got an affidavit from the man who was threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.687" offset="7426717">He reported first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.615" offset="7430374">We interviewed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.161" offset="7432568">We got his affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.523" offset="7438002">We can't do anymore with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.207" offset="7444793">We can give him a lie detector test maybe but that is not very worthwhile, it won't stand up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.499" offset="7469976">And now second, the only other thing we can do I submit is to go to the two people that, who we believe, who have threatened to dynamite the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.917" offset="7503621">We say, “Did you threaten to dynamite the plant?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.160" offset="7512607">The man said, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.887" offset="7515533">I think he'd say no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.817" offset="7519190">I don't believe he'd admit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.646" offset="7522534">I submit further, have we done that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.264" offset="7529012">Have we gone through these men and interrogated them, we'd have additional unfair labor practice charges based on interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.295" offset="7553149">We -- in this context, I'm not sure that we could have gotten by with interviewing these two people who we believe had threatened to dynamite the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.217" offset="7588780">But this is the limit of the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.338" offset="7597349">We could have reported to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.123" offset="7604454">I'm not sure that the police would've done much at this level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.127" offset="7620441">This is always the real problem in labor practice and labor cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.286" offset="7637055">You've got a threat to dynamite.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erle Phillips</label>
            <text syncTime="2002.289" offset="8009143">Yes sir, that's the Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.651" offset="8014576">That's the Fifth Circuit approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.887" offset="8023458">Now, I think -- I think this with respect to the 8 (a) (3) violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.958" offset="8051775">I will focus, if I may a little bit about that first because again the Board never brought up this 8 (a) (1) theory in the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.839" offset="8075285">First time we ran into this was in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.955" offset="8087719">I don't really think they mean this unless they are asking this Court to go so far as to say any -- any act of discharge is a violation of 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.433" offset="8125649">And I don't believe they really want to say that because if they did, I submit this Court wasted a lot of time in for instance Erie Resistor in talking about lack of motivation and dispensability of motivation because if the Board is correct now, you could have just said, “Well, it's an 8 (a) (1) violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.196" offset="8188761">The remedy is the same so let's forget about 8 (a) (3).”</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.360" offset="8201404">But in general, this Court has held that motive is an essential element of a violation of 8 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.284" offset="8237035">This Court has -- has said on many occasions that employees can be fired for no reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.545" offset="8270158">The Act permits a discharge for any reason other than union activity or agitation for collective bargaining with employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.449" offset="8293773">Now, over the years, there have been some exceptions ground out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.991" offset="8315925">Now, I submit these exceptions are fairly narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.065" offset="8332225">I think you can sum them up this way that you can dispense with specific evidence of intent, in a Section 8 (a) (3) situation, where you've got two factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.221" offset="8384784">One that the discrimination itself is based on the criterion of union membership or some phase of union activity, and then two, that the discouragement of union membership is natural and foreseeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.979" offset="8439850">And Mr. Justice Black as I recall joined by Mr. Justice -- Mr. Justice Douglas dissented in the Radio Officers case on this point and said you have to require motivation in every 8 (a) (3) situation but the majority held otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.206" offset="8516754">Now, the case is that if one analyze them, let's take Erie Resistor which is an easy one, the superseniority case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.629" offset="8550504">Here, the act of discrimination was clearly based on union membership or a lack of union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.551" offset="8578194">In other words, if you were a non-union and come to work, you get superseniority; two if you lead the strike, you get superseniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.196" offset="8604735">Clearly, this is a discrimination based on union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.213" offset="8620826">Then the second aspect quite obviously if superseniority is law, it destroys the probability of union in the particular plant involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.223" offset="8668891">So this -- this case clearly meant both of these tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.538" offset="8678087">One that the discrimination itself is based on union membership with some aspect of it and two, that there'll be clearly foreseeable encouragement or discouragement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.319" offset="8713195">Well, your Radio Officer's case is the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.259" offset="8728973">In Radio Officers, the radio officer couldn't get a job because he didn't clear it to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.837" offset="8751334">Once again, the discrimination was based on his failure to observe union rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.558" offset="8774217">Clearly, the effect there was to drive people in the union so you have both motives again tested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.856" offset="8795324">Gehner, the same thing as you -- as the Court will recall, this is a case of the called union and the company and the union negotiate in the contract which provided for an increase for union members but no increase for the non-union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.726" offset="8850808">Once again, the discrimination, no fee increase, the basis for it, non -- lack of membership in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.278" offset="8881110">And once again, the other factor of emphasizing or encouraging union membership is present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.139" offset="8912457">So I think that in all of these cases that this Court has decided and Republic is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.421" offset="8941610">Republic and (Inaudible) are the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.428" offset="8953626">In all of these cases, the discrimination on the one hand has been based on some aspects of union membership while on the other hand there has certainly been a clearly foreseeable encouragement or discouragement of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.742" offset="9010887">Now, the -- this case is here, I assume, because of the conflict between the Circuits and I'm not sure that this is really a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.893" offset="9067520">The first case is Industrial Cotton Mills, N.L.R.B. versus Industrial Cotton Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.424" offset="9089672">In that case, there was an economic striker who was refused reinstatement when he -- when the company had a good faith but mistaken belief that he had thrown tax in the street, only if he'd thrown tax maybe he'd thrown matches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.332" offset="9157277">Now again, in the Radio Officer, Mr. Justice Black distinguish this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.751" offset="9170965">He says that none of this case is important here since he thinks the Board made findings of the employer's purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.424" offset="9193639">But aside from that statement, I submit to the Court that Industrial Cotton Mills is distinguishable because it is a strike situation and because of the provisions of Section 2 point -- Section 2 (3) of the Act and Section 13 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.563" offset="9262184">Now, the Congress in its wisdom has -- has extended I think more protections to the right to strike than it has to other situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.852" offset="9307324">And the Court in deciding this -- the Court of Appeals in deciding Industrial Cotton, made reference to these sections of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.192" offset="9340761">First, Section 13 says, nothing in this Act except this specifically provided for herein shall be construed so as to interfere with or impede or diminish in any way the right to strike or to affect the limitations or qualifications on that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.660" offset="9398544">When it -- if the Court will recognize that law itself gives extended protection to a striker, to an un -- unreplaced economic striker for example then it follows that such a -- such a person as a matter of law is entitled to have his job back unless in fact he has done something wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.048" offset="9492167">Mistaken belief then will not prevail even in good faith in the case of a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.006" offset="9515990">But this is -- this is because of the specific provisions of the law, protecting the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.195" offset="9544725">Now, Cusano is a case in which there was not a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.808" offset="9579207">I think again that Cusano can be distinguished on this basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.018" offset="9600000">This is a case in which the employer fired a particular man who was the leader of the union because he came back from a meeting with the Board, with the employer for the purpose of arranging consent election and made a report to the union committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.579" offset="9678263">Now this is what the Board found that he was fired for doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.044" offset="9712118">They didn't -- the Board didn't actually find that this man was fired for misstating something although there was an argument as to what he did say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.336" offset="9741270">The employer said that the man came back and misstated profits that he used to figure over half a million as being profits when in reality that figure had reference to the sales and purchases of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.165" offset="9788604">But the Board in its finding made a clear statement that the facts as established that the respondent discharged Palladino because of his activities on behalf of the union in reporting to the shop committee what had occurred at the Board conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.654" offset="9850567">I think if -- if -- if this is realized that -- that the Board affirmed by the -- the Court of Appeals found that the man was fired for his protected activity in making the report to the committee, then again, the case is distinguishable from the present case which involves a good faith but mistaken belief as to wrongful activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.865" offset="9931442">Now, of course if -- the -- if the Court here should disagree with this then we would have to recognize that Cusano is simply in conflict with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.342" offset="9977313">There's one other case on which Board relies that's Cambria Clay, another Circuit Court case and of course that was a strike situation and we put that in the same category as Industrial Cotton Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.883" offset="10019527">Now, the Board -- the Board claims that on many occasions, Rubin has been followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.043" offset="10056098">I've tried to read the cases cited in the Board brief and others and in general those cases are distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.958" offset="10083788">One, that strike situations were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.599" offset="10098312">Two, that when you really read the decision, the Board made a finding of bad faith not good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.155" offset="10124539">And so it was never necessary to reach the question of a good faith but mistaken belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.601" offset="10150348">For instance in (Inaudible) one case is cited by the Board in its brief that was a strike situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.192" offset="10172709">Patterson-Sargent Company was a strike situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2619.546" offset="10478132">Now, in this case, if the rule is still to be that an employer has a right to fire an employee for no reason, for an arbitrary reason, an unreasonable reason, any reason of an engagement in protected activity, then it has to follow that the employer has the right to fire an employee because of the mistaken but good faith belief that he has done something wrong, in this case, a threat to dynamite the plant which under federal law is a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.363" offset="10621388">If you can fire the man for nothing, no reason, then does it have to follow that he can fire the man for a good faith but mistaken belief as to some wrongful conduct?</text>
