            <label>Mr. Chester C. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="8.711" offset="34795">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.709" offset="62798">Number 501 involves the basic controversy between the use -- two company and the additional defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.609" offset="106371">And that is whether TWA should be controlled by stockholders or by the lending institutions we claim have monopolized the supplying of senior financing to the major airlines of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.130" offset="176483">In order to address myself, or for the Court to address itself to the issues which are involved in connection with the dismissal of those counterclaims with prejudice, I think it is important that I'd spend sometime to explain the nature of those counterclaims and the facts which I've described at those counterclaims in which underlie the legal theories under which they have been brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.479" offset="265822">The counterclaims alleged that the Equitable and the Metropolitan together with another insurance company have in fact a monopoly on the supplying of senior long-term financing to major airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.049" offset="332173">And that they abused their dominant position in that field, if not a monopolistic position in that field, to interfere with and acquire control over the management of various airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.649" offset="386508">And this has been accomplished by a variety of means.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.135" offset="396539">Now counterclaims described in some detail the conduct which we claimed these additional defendants have engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.480" offset="429871">It involves the use of the traditional lender concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.897" offset="447530">It involves of the use of interlocking relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.941" offset="463726">It involves the use of terms and conditions in connection with the financing they supply unrelated to -- in a reasonable needs of a lender and the use of negative covenants in connection of those terms and conditions so as to achieve their objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.016" offset="532062">We also claim in these counterclaims that these additional defendants entered into a conspiracy among themselves as to the terms and conditions of the basis upon which they would make their financing available.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.740" offset="586919">More particularly insofar as TWA was concerned, one of the principle means were used was this insistence upon management clauses and voting trusts, not as means of remedies in the events of default, that we would not object to, but as conditions preceding to making any senior financing available.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.192" offset="684722">Now -- well, Your Honor there's a difference between a lender who said, “If you don't pay your interest on time, if you don't pay the installments on time, I'm going to take over control of the business”.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.748" offset="738952">And it's another thing for lenders to get together and say, “I'm going to take control of your business before I lend you any money”.</text>

            <text syncTime="478.613" offset="1914358">I submit that it was error because the question was not whether or not I was complying with discovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="501.067" offset="2004219">And the reason for my going into the nature -- scope of these counterclaims is to point out the problem that here exist is that this course of conduct of describing my counterclaim, described the violation of the antitrust laws as well as the violation of Federal Aviation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.046" offset="2068167">Admittedly, if it's a violation of the Federal Aviation Act, the CAB has to act first.</text>

            <text syncTime="536.781" offset="2147056">My problem there is not because I claimed there wasn't any approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.467" offset="2161789">I claimed the CAB never approved this conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.020" offset="2172029">But they filed replies 11 days after the -- this Court's decision in Panagra asserting as a defense that the CAB had approved their conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.639" offset="2214452">I have no alternative about that point and I suspend that litigation on the counterclaims before there was any decision by Judge Metzner on my complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.168" offset="2248620">And it is not a fact that I made my motion to suspend litigation because of discovery orders or because of what happened to me on the complaint, that is simply not the fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="618.769" offset="2475050">But nevertheless they claimed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.849" offset="2483304">Then, they would have the defense of it to that aspect to the violation of the antitrust laws by treating 414 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.064" offset="2516219">So I claim that a right as a claimant so long as it did not cause them any legal prejudice, that I had a right to suspend my prosecution of the counterclaims at the time that I did but when conferred with as a dismissal of prejudice because I found myself with a position where I could not get complete and adequate relief admittedly so because admittedly I cannot get relief by reason of my alleged violation of Federal Aviation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.571" offset="2626247">If I state below, I could not have gotten complete and adequate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.115" offset="2652369">And therefore I decided to suspend -- the only risk I was taking was on the statute of limitations, as for a state to avoid that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.120" offset="2680477">And that's the only reason why I asked for a stay rather than for a voluntary nonsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="680.803" offset="2723109">But of course, while TWA was making a motion to dismiss these counterclaims on various grounds and implying approval by the CAB, it was not until they filed a replies on January 23rd 1963 that they asserted as an affirmative defense an alleged approval by CAB of this voting trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.362" offset="2801371">It is not true to state but I'm not before the CAB for the purpose of establishing a defense by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.009" offset="2823941">I'm before the CAB because of what is a clear violation, in my judgment of the Federal Aviation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.064" offset="2856229">It was also something I filed before the CAB, Your Honor, because of the most shocking thing which took place in December of 1962 and that is when after they took control of this airline in December of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.052" offset="2908160">After six months thereafter, they filed a complaint seeking divestiture of our stock which we'd acquire pursuant to the CAB approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.813" offset="2939193">After they had imposed upon TWA an additional loan of $147 million on terms and conditions that the entire amount would mature all at once if the voting trust ever terminated, what did they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="749.861" offset="2999380">Without right to vote 78% of the stock, but developed a plan to merge TWA with Pan Am.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.310" offset="3033234">When the chief executive of Pan Am and two other directors were also directors of the Metropolitan and when the chief executive of Pan Am is a chairman of the finance committee of the Metropolitan.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.704" offset="3082762">Notwithstanding the fact that both President Truman and President Eisenhower have not accepted this doctrine of the chosen instrument concept that Pan Am has been advocating, what Pan Am has done was first to acquire American Overseas Airline and now, through the Metropolitan tried to completely take over TWA.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.389" offset="3169489">Now that's what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.756" offset="3174922">That's what triggered -- and why is that merger that -- which they filed with the CAB stock because of the complaint which we filed before CAB.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.719" offset="3218808">Now, the latest efforts of the -- these additional defendants in this lender control management are engaged in to prevent us and prevent the stockholders from controlling this airline occurred very recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.287" offset="3281084">Two -- the two company had a contractual right to be sure with the 22% penalty if you please, to pay back these insurance companies and thereby terminate the voting trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.997" offset="3335941">Well last year, last summer, we went to the CAB for permission to do just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.070" offset="3368229">By that time, the 22% premium reduces and were down to about 16.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.930" offset="3387664">But that way, we'd also be reacquiring 6.5% and those were presumably the premiums of the economic impact on us with substantial but something that -- it was important, it is important to us to regain control of this airline.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.362" offset="3441371">Well, TWA opposed that before the CAB.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.419" offset="3457672">TWA -- the management of TWA opposed before the CAB the right of the two company, its 78% stockholder to take steps to pay back these insurance companies and terminate the voting trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.883" offset="3507513">The CAB held that if we dispose of our interest or control of Northeast Airlines in 1962, they permit us to acquire control of another sick airline, Northeast Airline.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.248" offset="3548891">They said, if we got rid of Northeast Airlines, then we could go ahead and exercise our contractual rights to payoff these insurance companies and terminate the voting trust without being involved a new concept, a new acquisition of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.418" offset="3601659">What does TWA do?</text>
            <text syncTime="901.385" offset="3605525">They appeal for the Second Circuit and I'm sorry to say Your Honor, the Second Circuit upheld TWA and set aside the order of the CAB.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.211" offset="3632797">That is a matter which I know the CAB is planning to file a petition for a review, I know I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.554" offset="3654113">But that is the last thing which has occurred in this struggle between the owners of this airline and these lending institutions to have acquired control of TWA, to have kept it as a captive market for their financing plans and other plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.173" offset="3716598">And that is basically clear Your Honor the problem -- the basic problem which is involved in 501.</text>

            <text syncTime="1266.993" offset="5067964">First, is it a violation of due process or an abuse of discretion for a District Court to dismiss a party's counterclaims with prejudice for repeated and deliberate refusals to obey court crucial discovery orders and the final refusal to prosecute when the refusal decision was the client's decision with full awareness of the consequences including a dismissal of all of its claim with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.451" offset="5205786">And the second question I apprehend is this, “Is the CAB jurisdiction so broad that the District Court has no jurisdiction over claims alleging conspiracy to violate the antitrust laws, prima-facie torts, and breaches of contract".</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.485" offset="5281855">I hope I can show that the answer to each question is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.431" offset="5301708">In 1960, Howard Hughes and his wholly owned company Toolco (Inaudible) -- induced the insurance companies and the group of banks led by Irving to lend TWA a $165 million to buy a jet aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.491" offset="5353953">Because of the incredible mismanagement which Hughes had inflicted upon TWA, the loan was ultimately conditioned upon Toolco's placing it 78% of stock of TWA in a voting trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.518" offset="5430021">The purpose of the voting trust obviously was to make sure that TWA's management was independent of Hughes until our loans were repaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.839" offset="5471295">Now whatever degree of control the voting trust represents, it was established and limited by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.595" offset="5506299">It was and is temporary and can be terminated at any time by TWA without any penalty and by Toolco with only the normal provision to make sure that if a third party buys out our loan, our rate of return on our money will be secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.792" offset="5599086">Toolco's repeated assertions that TWA's management that is lender-control is hardly accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.108" offset="5632418">The lenders have never exercised any control over TWA's management including its decision to bring and prosecute the lawsuit in 443.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.259" offset="5672960">The actions of the lenders have been confined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.339" offset="5685290">They were pointing two entirely independent trustees, Mr. Hughes appointing a third which independent trustees promptly proceeded to elect an independent and outstanding board of directors and that's all we've ever done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.523" offset="5754044">Now, on February 1962, the counterclaims were filed against TWA and under Rule 13-H, we eight were joined as additional defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.899" offset="5799497">An understanding of the counterclaims, I'm sure is vital to show how important discovery was to us and also to show that Toolco's jurisdictional argument is frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.400" offset="5865535">Mr. Davis has saved me the trouble of summarizing the counterclaims except that he hasn't made it quite accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.348" offset="5901375">The first, third, fourth and fifth counterclaims and there are five of them altogether, as the sixth, we're not concerned with, alleged numerous violations of the antitrust laws, the gist of those charges is that the additional defendants have conspired since prior to 1956 if you please, to monopolize the trade of lending money to air carriers have conspired to fix high interest rates and have conspired to monopolize the TW market for finance -- TWA market for financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.984" offset="6031882">And as an important part of those charges, it is alleged that we, the additional defendants, rather than Hughes and Toolco caused delay in the TWA jet program, and forced Hughes to put Toolco's stock in the voting trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.725" offset="6106802">Now those underlying facts are charged as a prima facie tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.676" offset="6122684">They are charged as a violation of Delaware state law, they are charged as breaching a -- breaches of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.802" offset="6147135">The counterclaims seek equitable relief and accounting $45 million for TWA derivatively and $308 million for Toolco as damages to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.763" offset="6203037">Now the second counterclaim which so far I have not mentioned seeks equitable relief only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.625" offset="6234488">It alleges a violation of Section 408 of the Aviation Act, by three only of the eight additional defendants, Metropolitan, Equitable and Irving.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.776" offset="6275030">It charges that Metropolitan and Equitable are engaged in the face of aeronautics within the meaning of Section 08 -- 408 and have unlawfully obtained control of TWA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.049" offset="6320170">Now that counterclaim is the only counterclaim that has anything at all to do with the Federal Aviation Act or the CAB jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.180" offset="6360712">It was dismissed by the Court of Appeals for that jurisdictional reason as the three named additional defendants had pleaded it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.048" offset="6404180">Now, I submit to the Court that these voluminous counterclaims were obviously brought to bring pressure upon TWA's financing institutions to induce or compel TWA to drop its suit against Toolco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.441" offset="6473665">But that step was a management decision with which we lenders should not, would not, and did not concern ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.584" offset="6514312">From the very beginning of the filing of these counterclaims in 1962, not more than three years ago, we additional defendants believe that the allegations of the counterclaims were false in all material respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.985" offset="6571886">We believe if -- that we could show if given the opportunity that Hughes was personally responsible for many of the acts alleged in the counterclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.009" offset="6612010">We were confident that we could show that Hughes himself had deliberately pushed TWA to the verge of bankruptcy in 1960 in order to reach personal -- to reap personal tax benefits for himself and his company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.042" offset="6668121">And we immediately on the very day the counterclaims were filed, served a notice to examine Hughes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.767" offset="6694975">We immediately started to seek the kind of discovery that a defendant is entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.129" offset="6732487">However, it took us over a year really to accomplish anything and then we were met by a blank wall and a refusal to give us what we clearly were entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.995" offset="6791941">Now, this obstruction was directed by the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.612" offset="6814407">It's not a case sir of an unwise lawyer, a careless lawyer, a mistaken lawyer, not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.113" offset="6852441">Instead, it represents a determined effort by Hughes and his company in which this gentleman was merely an instrument to maintain the counterclaims as long as it could but to prevent discovery of the facts at any and all costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.678" offset="6934674">Now, there were three separate categories of information which Hughes refused to produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.743" offset="6954945">First, there were a group of documents which he refused to produce claiming they were covered by the attorney-client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.343" offset="6981277">Hughes had used his lawyers as we showed before the Special Masters, business agents to negotiate the very agreements involved in the counterclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.445" offset="7017744">But these lawyers had made affidavits in this and other cases as had their clients which disclosed all of the confidential relationship between the lawyer and client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.702" offset="7070720">And one of those affidavits as the Special Master said really constituted the first draft of the counterclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.563" offset="7106247">Toolco had also pleaded as a defense to the charges of the complaint that everything it did, it did on the advice of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.939" offset="7143654">So do you wonder that the Special Master after looking at the papers and hearing extensive argument said the privileges waived -- been waived, produced that arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.970" offset="7187853">Mr. Davis went to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.006" offset="7196003">We argued it all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.318" offset="7205198">The District Court affirms and produced the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.918" offset="7223589">Davis wanted reargument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.449" offset="7229753">The Master gave it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.141" offset="7236545">He looked at the documents himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.252" offset="7244904">He again ordered their production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.828" offset="7251278">Again, the Court affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.797" offset="7259115">Mr. Davis went to the Court of Appeals then with the -- an appeal and the petition for writ of mandamus both of which were denied by that Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.703" offset="7306762">And then, Toolco bluntly refused to produce the documents and Mr. Davis wrote a letter to the Court, the District Court below, on January 23, saying that Toolco would not obey the Court's order and I want to read it to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.754" offset="7382936">It's (b) -- page 385 at a pretrial hearing, (b) is this --</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.565" offset="7418253">At the pretrial hearing, January 28, 1963 the Court -- you wrote me a letter, Mr. Davis on January 23rd, which has been made part of the record before the Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.267" offset="7473006">I will just refer to the last three lines of the second sentence of the letter, which read, “I must respectfully decline to comply with your said orders, at least prior to a determination of this motion to dismiss now pending before Your Honor”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.363" offset="7561404">The judge continued, “The question I want to ask you about these three lines is, “Did you make this decision on your own or did you discuss this with your client?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.344" offset="7621277">Mr. Davis, “I discussed it with my clients Your Honor”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.264" offset="7644996">The record shows that those so-called privilege documents were conveniently assembled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.432" offset="7673626">It could have been produced in an instant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.319" offset="7685224">And yesterday, Mr. Davis told Your Honors that he gave those documents to the District Court to do whatever it wanted with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.124" offset="7720438">That is untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.896" offset="7731513">He gave the documents to the District Court to review in connection with its ruling as any court should do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.427" offset="7761607">The Court then returned the documents to Davis and ordered him to give them to us and we were met with a complete and blunt refusal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.015" offset="7804029">Now the second deliberate default of Toolco is with respect to tax documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.588" offset="7830256">Toolco said in a footnote in its reply brief at page 12 and Mr. Davis told you yesterday that the tax documents after all were just Toolco's 1961 and 1962 tax returns which could be handed over in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.179" offset="7896712">That is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.282" offset="7905071">If you will look at B-237 to 240, you will see that the documents in question are listed in a long schedule of 23 separate groups of tax documents with all of which we sought and all of which Toolco refused to produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.092" offset="7980304">And only the last two of those 23 groups concern 1961 or 1962 returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.530" offset="8006113">All of the remainder relate to pre-1961 tax information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.916" offset="8027638">And Mr. Davis knows very well that much more is involved than merely these two little tax returns for 1961 and 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.640" offset="8066508">As page B235 of the record shows, Mr. Davis objected to the production at one time before the Court because as he said, "It would take weeks to try to gather all the material called for."</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.436" offset="8157727">Now this information I submit to the Court, we were confident, would have exposed Hughes' motives for delaying the TWA financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.193" offset="8204748">From the document which he did produce for us, we believe that we could show a pattern of abuse of his control of -- to TWA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.905" offset="8247589">And we believe we could show that the delay of the 1960 financing was his fault in the early record of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.429" offset="8277682">For example, we were confident that the withheld documents would show that Toolco bought numbers of these jets, in fact all of the jets instead of TWA and leased them to TWA on a day-to-day basis in order to make large profits for Toolco and for Hughes which profits increased with every days delay in working out a financial plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.322" offset="8389277">We hoped to show that Toolco charged off the jets which it bought and leased and accelerated depreciation against which it charged the daily rentals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.360" offset="8437342">And when it finally sold the leased jets to TWA, it sold them at cost less straight line depreciation, thus realizing millions of profits for Toolco and to the great damage of TWA and also being able to charge all these gains as capital gains and not as income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.651" offset="8522501">Thus, we submit the documents had we ever been able to get hands on them, would have tended to show that Hughes and not be additional defendants who caused the damage to TWA with which we were charged in the counterclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.660" offset="8582583">Moreover, we expected the hold -- that to show that the withheld documents would show that Hughes had used TWA as a device to avoid tax so far as Toolco was (Inaudible) -- concerned, Hughes owned a 100% of Toolco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.823" offset="8655203">Toolco made enormous profits, if it declared dividends, Hughes would have had to pay income tax on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.191" offset="8680699">If the profits however were unreasonably accumulated by Toolco, it would have to pay a substantial penalty tax under 531.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.433" offset="8713718">And to avoid both taxes, Hughes may well have kept TWA impoverished so that Toolco could justify its otherwise unreasonable accumulations by reference to TWA's needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.633" offset="8770456">Further examples of what we -- were sure -- we could or hopefully could prove by these documents and by Hughes' examination are 18 and 19 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.442" offset="8809744">Now both the Special Master and the Court found good cause for and ordered production of these documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.204" offset="8836807">Hughes -- Toolco refused to produce them although they were readily available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.701" offset="8858749">And at a time of neither of these defaults, if you please, was there any assertion that they were justified by Panagra or by any lack of jurisdiction in the ordering court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.093" offset="8928340">The third default was Hughes' refusal to appear for examination by us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.104" offset="8948402">He would have been I submit obviously the most important witness from our standpoint in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.679" offset="8974629">And with the aid of the documents, we though we could have forced him to admit his tax manipulations and that he had deliberate caused to his lawyers many of expert with which we are charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.714" offset="9030844">Now the date for Hughes' examination was set many, many, many times and adjourned on Toolco's motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2366.902" offset="9467507">Now, may it please the Court, I was starting to say the third default was Hughes' refusal to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.925" offset="9499690">There's no doubt that what he refused to appear and there's no doubt that Toolco was told of what the sanctions were and what might happened and that it was Toolco's decision to make the default in appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.484" offset="9589864">Dismissal of the counterclaims and with prejudice was justified under Rule 37 and Rule 41.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.207" offset="9616823">Now in the Link case, I do not have to remind you, I'm sure that his Court sustained dismissal with prejudice for failure to prosecute where all that happened was the plaintiff's counsel had been lax in prosecuting his client's personal injury claim and had failed to appear at the pretrial conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.828" offset="9687249">Here I say again unlikely, this refusal with the clients and this case I submit is far more grievous than either the dismissal with prejudice in Hammond Packing or in Link so much so, that I say to Your Honors that I rely not only on the majority opinion which I think is clearly right, but I also place almost equal reliance on the dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.621" offset="9798426">The dissent said that no client should be penalized for the conduct of his lawyer and I quote from page 648 of 370 U.S., unless notice is given to the client himself that such a threat hangs over his head, "Such a rule would do nothing more that incorporate basic constitutional requirements of fairness into the administration of justice of this country".</text>

            <text syncTime="2665.161" offset="10660571">And since here, Toolco was Hughes and Hughes was Toolco, it was merely calling upon Hughes to produce himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2683.662" offset="10734550">In this case, he has no orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.550" offset="10746149">His claim is that we defendants may as a result of his complaint sometime in the future obtain a good defense to his counterclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.402" offset="10797558">He urges this might be so because the CAB at some future time he says may issue an order retroactively approving our acquisition of control of TWA 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.194" offset="10852728">And he says that might retroactively exempt all of our conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.411" offset="10877597">Now, in fact nothing that the CAB might ever do, could in anyway exempt us from liability from any of the Acts alleged in the counterclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.171" offset="10920647">Section 414, the only exemptive section, provides that a person affected by an order under 408 shall be exempted from the operations of the antitrust laws and other restraints insofar as maybe necessary to enable such person to do anything authorized, required or proved by such order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.459" offset="11021793">Clearly, as this Court pointed out in Panagra and the CAB confirms in its amicus brief here, this Section has only perspective application and thus relates only to acts taken by an affected person after the entry of an order, under Section 408, if such an order in the future could not possibly exempt, could not possibly be construed to reach backwards prior to 1956 and exempt us from all the asserted liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.267" offset="11160973">In making the argument for the CAB order might have this impossible retroactive effect of eliminating private lawsuits, Toolco also overlooks entirely Section 1106 of the Act which provides that nothing contained in this chapter shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.849" offset="11267344">Now, Toolco places so far up until today -- maybe today a great reliance in Panagra.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.778" offset="11291063">But of course, as you all realized full well, Panagra involved only an agreement to allocate air rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="2884.324" offset="11537241">And the only question presented is that Department of Justice under the antitrust laws are the CAB, the proper ones to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.814" offset="11571200">Now, Section 411 under which that proceeding was brought does -- this is not included under Section 414, the exemptive section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.451" offset="11617802">So, if there was any contention that our Act came under 11, we couldn't possibly be exempted by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.354" offset="11649358">Now, I submit that the record supports the holding of the Court of Appeals that Hughes and Toolco in this matter looked upon discovery as some sort of a gain and that Toolco's position regarding jurisdiction is and was nothing more than a part of that game, the purpose of which was to harass the additional defendants, try to get them to call off the suit against Toolco without giving the additional defendants an opportunity to establish that the counterclaims had no support in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.674" offset="11798674">And I submission -- I submit for these two reasons that judgment below should be affirmed in all respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.440" offset="11837753">Now finally, the client here Toolco, not only had notice and directed a default but that default continued in the Court of Appeals because after we got up there, Mr. Justice Kaufman repeatedly asked Davis whether if that Court reversed on -- conditioned on Hughes' appearance -- Hughes would comply with the order to appear and Mr. Davis would not even then agree that Hughes would appear and I submit sirs that the time to negotiate with this gentleman has passed and the judgment should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3050.966" offset="12203781">In my second counterclaim repeating other allegations, I said and this furthermore violates the Federal Aviation Act of Section 408.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.658" offset="12242547">And everybody admits that I could not get relief and my central relief is to terminate this voting trust and I cannot get it from the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.803" offset="12279118">And Mr. Bromley would like us to overlook the fact that I made the decision to suspend litigation on the counterclaims before I was required to produce these documents he's talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.821" offset="12331259">Now let's talk about the need of Mr. Hughes for the purpose of enabling themselves to defend themselves against the allegations of the counterclaims by reason of their conduct and the way they used their mono (Inaudible) -- their monopolistic powers and conspired is beyond belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.668" offset="12394580">The truth of the matter is that these people anticipated my counterclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.001" offset="12416000">In anticipation of my counterclaim, they filed this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.163" offset="12432614">And I would like to call the Court's attention first the testimony of Mr. Tillinghast which appeared in the (Inaudible) -- Appendix before the Court of Appeals, A399 when he said -- and I was questioning about the circumstance under which he authorized the filing of this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.138" offset="12504503">I was trying to find what it was all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.026" offset="12512026">And he said, “I believe in a telephone call to counsel, say that I heard from Mr. Gilmore some rumor and I can't remember just what it was at this point, indicative of the fact that the two companies might be preparing to institute an action out in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.185" offset="12568660">And therefore I thought we ought to go right ahead with it and not run that risk”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.544" offset="12586109">And that should be kept in line with the testimony of Mr. Kokey (ph) which I quoted in part in my brief in 501 at page 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.800" offset="12619128">Mr. Kokey (ph) is the Senior Vice-President of TWA.</text>

            <text syncTime="3171.020" offset="12684016">There was a discussion that I recall that one of the reason TWA was to file the suit first was to obtain the right of prior deposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="3246.917" offset="12987664">And if so, if that is true, what is your answer to the question as to whether Mr. Hughes is a proper witness?</text>

            <label>Mr. Chester C. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="3257.026" offset="13028101">Well, Your Honor, the fact is that that -- the reason for my suspension of the counterclaim is wholly unrelated to the discovery of Mr. Hughes of any documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.022" offset="13064046">That was the problem of not being able to get adequate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.125" offset="13080451">Insofar as Mr. Bromley, you're quite correct Your Honor, Mr. Bromley does try to say that he needed Mr. Hughes very badly for the purpose of the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.898" offset="13115559">The thing that Mr. Bromley did not explain to Your Honor however is how can Mr. Hughes' conduct had anything to do with respect to what they did subsequent to 1960 after the voting trust was created and what did Mr. Hughes' activities have to do with respect to what is alleged in the counterclaims which is their conspiracy to make senior financing available upon certain terms and conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.106" offset="13212421">I don't deny that it could -- arriving point in the litigation when Mr. Hughes' testimony might be important to them and presumably they will make a showing to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.329" offset="13253277">What is also ignored here Your Honor is that all the deposition that took place by order of Judge Metzner, we would not and I was not permitted to have any deposition, any discovery on the issue of the counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.840" offset="13299357">In that connection, Mr. Justice Goldberg, the Court of Appeals is in error in referring to the record as indicating that there had been a lot of deposition taken on the issues of the counterclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.525" offset="13338018">There was some deposition taken on the issues of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.262" offset="13352960">No deposition was taken on the counterclaims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.252" offset="13364976">They were furnished with a mass of documents because they were asking for the same thing TWA was asking for and so long as I was producing the TWA, I was also giving it to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.962" offset="13403847">It is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.636" offset="13406459">They did certainly with a notice for the production of documents and for the examination Mr. Hughes as an alleged managing agent of the Tool Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.824" offset="13443239">But the issue that is involved here Your Honor is not the question of discovery permitted or not permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.401" offset="13465600">The issue is two-fold and that is primarily whether or not a claimant who reaches the point where he realizes he cannot get complete and adequate relief, may suspend litigation without legal prejudice to the additional defendants, or any defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.900" offset="13527562">And the moment he decides to stop prosecuting, what duties and obligation does he then act?</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.764" offset="13555043">The other question which is involved is the one which it -- unquestionably is more complicated that is involved in 443 and that is by reason of the course of conduct which I am alleging in the counterclaim, which unquestionably involved the Federal Aviation Act and the CAB, they admit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.143" offset="13620558">There is where you have the question even though we claim that no orders of approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.350" offset="13645322">They claim even in their brief today, they claim they got approval from the CAB for this voting trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.915" offset="13667579">Under that state of affairs, I don't see how any alternative but to say then, I've got to get relief from the CAB first before I can continue to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.660" offset="13698612">I cannot be on both places at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.774" offset="13711047">I don't want to incur the expenses of litigation if I'm not going to be able to get the relief I'm seeking, if I have to get relief from the agency first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.703" offset="13742811">That is the decision that was made on February 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.466" offset="13757858">That is all that occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.039" offset="13764127">What they're not trying to do however are trying to involve and make this things also complicated that this was a question of a deliberate refusal on my part to produce documents which I had available to produce to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.136" offset="13812506">I admit that with respect to the attorney-client privileges after I've exhausted all my legal remedies, I did make those available to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.428" offset="13845629">I did refuse to waive the attorney-client privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.016" offset="13860049">Now, what is the confusion there is Your Honors and -- that is a question which -- did not plan to take the time to argue, it was recognized that all of these documents that were withheld where in fact communication between attorney and client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.300" offset="13929117">The question was whether they had been waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.514" offset="13937998">We did not claim the attorney-client privilege with respect to negotiations or activities that the lawyers participated in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.584" offset="13970286">They claim that it was waived primarily because of an affidavit filed before the CAB and because of some assertions made in my pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.181" offset="14000692">I claimed that until such time as they were entitled to the documents where I could waive my defenses in any event, so far as I was concerned, I was in no position to waive the attorney client privilege and if the Court to whom I physically surrender the documents, furnished them through these additional defendants, then so far I was concerned, I was protecting my attorney-client privilege to the extent to which I could at least until after I had appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.893" offset="14119497">Because I did file for it, interlocutory appellate review of that question, it was denied to me, not on the merits, but they denied me of the interlocutory appeal and denied my writ to bring up that question for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.694" offset="14170697">Now, there's a lot of talk about this leases and tax benefits since I'd like to straighten down half a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.078" offset="14188251">The lease that they referred to of course are leases which -- submitted to the CAB and approved by the CAB and it is not true that we were realizing any particular tax benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.527" offset="14222106">This argument that the Tool company -- is my time, I have five --</text>

            <label>Mr. Chester C. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="3562.547" offset="14250109">I realized any tax benefit under 531 is just simply does not make any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.951" offset="14275709">From the tax point of view, it makes no different whether the parent as we were furnished additional capital funds to a subsidiary in form of cash or provided that a systems in the form of making down payments on orders for aircraft or for purchasing of aircraft to be made available to the subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.921" offset="14355644">And the tax point of view, from the 531 point of view where it's done this way or that way, it has exactly the same significance insofar as any unreasonable retention of income is concerned to 531.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.000" offset="14415935">Chief Justice, thank you very much for the extra time you've given me.</text>
