            <text syncTime="253.117" offset="1012402">The petitioner was sentenced after that to one to three years in a reformatory and he is presently incarcerated at Lorton in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.149" offset="1056496">Now, at the conclusion of the evidence when the jury had been deliberating for approximately two hours, the juries sent a note to the trial judge which I would like to read.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.968" offset="1155866">The trial judge then gave a supplemental instruction to the effect that the jury must decide the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.171" offset="1256594">Now the judge emphasized this point of making it necessary for the jury to reach the decision at least three or four times in an instruction that is not over a page long in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1263.569" offset="5054276">If it has to be sustained then to the Allen charge, we should lose but all you have to -- is look at the two pages, they're totally different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.264" offset="5084996">But I also think the Chief Justice's question led in the right direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.858" offset="5103386">Of course, the charge doesn't have to be sustained under the Allen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.551" offset="5126165">Judges make the law as to what it said when a jury returns and the question is, what's proper law?</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.268" offset="5149048">What was said here was not the Allen charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.044" offset="5164095">Arizona didn't deny -- even Arizona didn't deny all supplemental instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.984" offset="5179873">I think Mr. Sisk was wrong about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.404" offset="5189590">They -- Arizona did say that the (Inaudible) -- that the Allen charge, well, in its view technically correct was more trouble than was worth and said that their lower court should no longer use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.947" offset="5239745">Finally, I'd like to begin by saying that Justice Stewart did characterize our position correctly as saying that coercion is of course bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.587" offset="5278302">And the issue in this case is whether there is coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.590" offset="5290318">That's an issue that has to be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.254" offset="5308918">Nevertheless, it does seem Mr. Sisk does return to the Allen charge and he returns to what the proper standards here are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.904" offset="5351549">And I would like it introduce my argument by talking for a moment about the standards which seemed to us to be rather clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.636" offset="5386449">We of course agree that a jury has no duty to decide a case if that means that it has to reach a verdict even though there remains conscientious difference of view after all avenues of rational persuasion have been exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.138" offset="5448516">They don't have to flip a coin, they don't have to fight, they don't have to compromise, and they don't have to vote with the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.273" offset="5477042">On the other hand, the jury does have a duty to exhaust all avenues, all reasonable avenues of rational persuasions and explore the areas of their differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.990" offset="5515912">It's the way the jury systems always been, it's the common law system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.783" offset="5531063">They don't vote individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.105" offset="5536392">They're putting the room together and expected to discuss the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.897" offset="5555513">In line of this, it's fairly easy to say with generality where the judge should or should not say when a jury returns after a period of time which he believes is inadequate for them to have explored the issues and see what their areas of disagreement are, he should say to them that he wants him to go back longer, discuss further, remain open minded, don't be stubborn, try to persuade the subject that need persuasion through persuasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.089" offset="5668258">Don't give up your conscientious views.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.303" offset="5681110">That's what the jury system is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.046" offset="5692082">Now all the Allen cases that have been cited in the brief involved four possible errors that can emerge out of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.101" offset="5724369">Three things a judge shouldn't say as Justice White indicated, he shouldn't indicate what view of the -- what verdict he thinks would be proper in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.897" offset="5763553">Incidentally in this case there is no -- there's no basis for I believe that Judge Holtzoff indicated that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1468.222" offset="5872849">Now, in the charge of the jury, the Court started out by saying, “Ladies and gentlemen in the jury, what we have here is a very simple case that will not detain new law and it -- in which you should have no difficulty in reaching a prompt decision one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.137" offset="5964487">However, they should do in addition to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.451" offset="5977757">He reviewed the (Inaudible) and told how these witnesses and each one of the robberies had identified this man and there was just this simple denial that he committed the robbery on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.444" offset="6041704">And then he also summarized the evidence to -- by saying that a few minutes later after this happened after the robbery, Officer DeMorrow (ph) of the police department testified that he and his partner and a couple of uniformed men responded to an alarm over the radio and they planted themselves in a particular point in these across the street and observed the defendant breathing heavily, acting nervously and running and arrested him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.390" offset="6181512">They took him to the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.053" offset="6188199">At first he refused to get out of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.951" offset="6199798">They ordered him to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.845" offset="6207321">They took him into the store and the officer testified that Mrs. Corrin and Jewel Davis (ph) identified the defendant as a man who just entered the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.042" offset="6248072">Now in view of that array of witnesses against the defendant, its simple denial of the fact that he were the man -- let's start the case -- the instructions offered with little indications that he is guilty when it says what we have here is a very simple case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2646.924" offset="10587638">Just a few words, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.507" offset="10601953">First I'd like to say that every jury panel on the District of Columbia that every panel of prospective jury members, I guess I should say are given detailed instructions before they ever walk into the courtroom as to what the duties of the juror are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.850" offset="10675304">I don't know whether the District of Columbia is unique in this respect but I do know that they're all given detailed instruction as to what their duties are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.023" offset="10708010">So I think -- I find it rather difficult to believe that these jury members simply decided not to vote because they didn't like the way the trial had been conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.797" offset="10751164">I think they had something else on their mind and it seems that rather incredible to me that they would completely disregard all of the instructions that they've been previously given and just sat in there and decided, "Well, we don't think we're even going to vote on this case because they simply haven't done a good enough job either the defense or the Government."</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.721" offset="10842802">But the main thing that concerns me is that the Government has assumed that a trial judge just has a right to make remarks to the jury after they re -- after they retire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.504" offset="10913959">I don't know why they have assumed this but this is the whole picture of the argument that a trial judge does have a right to make this remarks just they point to no authority whatsoever, no authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.719" offset="10966831">We have been able to find no authority other than count -- other than the Allen case and that's why we continue to say that what was said in this case was set under the authority of the Allen case and if every individual does have a right to have a jury disagree and that's what we contend in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.374" offset="11045407">That every individual has that right then no matter how slight the intrusion is, no matter how careful the trial judge is when he intrudes upon that right upon making any suggestion whatsoever that they should agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.588" offset="11114266">Well, then he's violated the constitutional right and it shouldn't be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.915" offset="11151569">Also one other thing I think would help to put this case on a better light.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.532" offset="11178109">Mr. Heymann said that he saw no reason why the Government attorney didn't object.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.958" offset="11207784">That there was nothing in the record to indicate why he didn't stand up and be heard at the proper time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.499" offset="11237982">And because of this, it might have been some tactical movement on his part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.877" offset="11255432">There is a stipulation between the Government and the petitioner which would permit the Court to read the entire transcript and as Mr. Heymann says at the very short transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.518" offset="11302034">And I would suggest that if the Court could look at the entire transcript, well they would have a better understanding as to why the Government, as to why the defense attorney didn't do anymore than he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.046" offset="11348114">He was interrupted practically on every page of the transcript without cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.378" offset="11377476">Not once but usually twice on every page of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.270" offset="11393045">I'd like to say that he was accused of -- he was accused of offensing with the witnesses, all of these in open Court before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.202" offset="11436722">He was accused offensing with the witnesses failing to cooperate, not being interested in the truth, dealing with the witnesses not at arm's length, being cagey, told to be frank, stop backing -- told to be open and above board and stop acting like a poker player.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.155" offset="11504536">Stop holding his cards so close to his chest, stop considering the trial a game.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.329" offset="11529300">Stop trying to trap the witnesses and endeavor to be more interested in justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.007" offset="11551974">Now I think that that puts it in a proper light.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.282" offset="11561064">Perhaps that's why he didn't say anything more than what he did.</text>
