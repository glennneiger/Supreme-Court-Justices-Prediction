            <label>Mr. Sam J. Ervin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="12.113" offset="48379">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.464" offset="57783">There has nothing whatever in the history -- list of history in the National Labor Relations Act that indicates any congressional purposed to the private enforce of their right to withdraw from business at anytime for any reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.641" offset="110550">On the contrary, there was have -- the legislative history shows the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.859" offset="127373">This Act had its genesis in the Wagner Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.113" offset="136359">When the Wagner Act was before Congress, congressman Griswold of Indiana, a ranked member of the committee which reported the Bill for the House assured the House that they have the House's assurance, there is nothing in the Bill to keep an operator from closing his plant and when the White Act was before the senate, Senator Walsh, chairman of the Senate Committee which reported the Bill, gave this assurance to the senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.720" offset="230818">Now, some fundamental rights an employer has just as our rights an employer -- an employee has.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.479" offset="257881">No one can impel -- compel an employer to keep his factory open.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.970" offset="275853">So in dealing with this Bill, we have not gone into that domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.139" offset="296542">The Wagner Act was subsequently converted to the National Labor Relation Acts by subsequent amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.791" offset="323082">The Act in its present form, uses the term employee 78 times, the term employer 64 times, the term employment, 22 times and the term commerce which it defines to mean interstate commerce, 31 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.437" offset="385672">In all essences, the terms employee, employer, employment and commerce are used in the Act in context which disclose that congressional purpose of the Act is to secure to employees the right to organize and bargain, collect to represent just their own to choosing it with their employer in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment and other conditions of employment, and to forbid the employer for the engaging in unfair practices interfering with such rights, so long and so long only, as the employment relation exists between the employees and their employer, and so long and so long only, as their employer is engaged in interstate commerce or in an industry affecting interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.165" offset="576575">There is not a syllable, a word, a phrase, a paragraph or a section in the Act, which can be reasonably construed to deny to any employer in the private business, the power to remove himself from the regulatory power of Congress under the interstate commerce clause at any time for any reason by vehemently going out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.619" offset="674377">If Congress had undertaken to pass an Act of that character, it would not only have exceeded its power under the interstate commerce which is restricted to the power to regulate people while they engaged in interstate commerce or in an industry affecting interstate commerce, but it would have been reported to the economic rights secured to Americans by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.938" offset="763716">It would have denied Darlington as a corporation, the right of property that it -- one of the fundamental rights of property to which is a right secured for that -- of a clause, to go out to this sale of its property at any time it pleases -- and also it would have denied the right protected by the Due Process Clause deliberative property on behalf of the stockholders of Darlington, because it would have denied them the privilege of exercising the liberty of disarming the corporation and taking it as their own property, for either sales or their net assets of the corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.101" offset="1028389">Yes, it's based upon the commerce clause plus the fact, that the railroad in Tennessee can merely a private profit for sale, is engaged in the performance of a duly affected with the public interest and for that reason, since it gets to public franchise in the nature of monopoly cannot withdraw as a private of business can.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.136" offset="1108532">I think that's the fundamental mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.226" offset="1116891">Now, I would like to say -- just a few more words that there never has been a case in which there has been a more diligent effort on the part of the general counsel to make out of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.584" offset="1182302">He took almost six years of time in order to propel this case and dig-up evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.717" offset="1206857">He produced thousands of pages of all testimony, and inspected thousands of documents belonging to some 20 different corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.298" offset="1237159">And when all of this evidence was produced, the trial examiner who did a most thorough job, made this correct finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.016" offset="1267984">He said in effect that there was not a scintilla, I mean not a bit of evidence introduced in this case which was inconsistent with the complete independence of Darlington and that all the thing the evidence showed with respect to the relations of Darlington to other corporations was and it had the same normal relations to Deering Milliken, the sales agent, as ordinarily existed between a manufacturer and corporation and the sales agent, and that it merely had some limited cooperation of a voluntary nature with some of the other corporations in an effort to minimize the cost of tax service, the cost of tenants service as the industrial engineers, and lack of services essential to its existence of which it could not otherwise have obtained or obtained so cheaply.</text>

            <text syncTime="391.036" offset="1564108">The finding is that they closed down to keep them dealing with the Union that is the first thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.030" offset="1584065">Now, the only one that was obligated to deal with the Union was the Darlington plant which had been designated as an appropriate bargaining unit and it was only one obligated to deal with the Union, the other plants that had no Union representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.058" offset="1640176">Now that the courts upheld, that is the lower courts have handed down decisions which are cited in brief, that if an employer who has several plants, closes down the plants which is a self-sustained and economic unit in itself that he is not guilty of an unfair labor practice (Voice Overlap) in doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.840" offset="1759295">Well, one of them is a rapid tran -- Rapid Boundary Incorporated and in that case they had two plants, one in -- one place in New York and another one they closed down the first and continued to operate the second, and held that it would not guilty -- an unfair labor practice in the first plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.676" offset="1826691">Then -- this Court has only made one pronouncement on this subject, and it says in this case of the Southport Petroleum Company case, which was passed in the 315 United States of page 100.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.154" offset="1892519">In that case, there had been labor controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.390" offset="1905476">And after the order of the National Labor Relations would refine reinstatement, and the case got into the Circuit Court, the employer attempted to raise, in court he said, he go and complete the out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.978" offset="1955840">He sold -- he has claimed and going out of business after the order was entered to the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.945" offset="1979768">The Circuit Court declined to order -- uphold the evidence taken on that part and this Court held that that was alright of course the port could be erased down the compliance decision after the decision of this Court and in that opinion, Mr. Chief Justice Jackson said -- stated -- recognizes and uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.020" offset="2052075">He says, “Well, there has been a modified discontinuance, at a true change of ownership which would terminate the duty of reinstatement created for the Board's order or merely a disguise continuous to all employer does not clearly unfair,” and he said, “That matter can be passed on the compliance thing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="528.888" offset="2115500">Now, I would like to make -- these are -- these closing observations.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.575" offset="2142250">This is a practical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.969" offset="2147788">Practically every substantial business in United States has to guide its conduct by the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.295" offset="2189166">And they have to do this under the interpretation placed upon it by lawyers and by businessmen, practical men.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.363" offset="2225424">And I think there's something in the King James version of the Bible that has a direct reference to this matter, a practical -- uses some practical wisdom.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.192" offset="2260741">It said, “God judges not as man judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.269" offset="2273071">Obey him, looketh upon the external appearance, but God looketh upon the heart.”</text>
            <text syncTime="573.338" offset="2293342">Now, we have this kind of a situation under the case of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.263" offset="2309016">Every economic factor indicates that the only successful thing for the business to do is to go out of existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.957" offset="2347781">That's what all the economic facts is, it's all the external appearances are.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.609" offset="2362410">As to thing that businessmen and the lawyers, they've had to guide themselves them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.633" offset="2382472">Can it be said that instead of having an objective standard, we have to have a subjective standard and in any cases where every economic factor demands it as a matter of sound judgment, the termination of the business, that the case terminates the business because of – because of perhaps while the [Inaudible] to have a sound head and good exercise of the good intellectual judgment, they have a sort of bad part, is that the kind of things as a practical matter in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.897" offset="2499500">Now, it was said yesterday that Deering Milliken got into this matter by offering these people employment, but he couldn't done it because it was six years after the Darlington went out of business before it was ever said that it was entered a duty on anybody to reinstate these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.678" offset="2578704">And then the order was made that Darlington would have to pay these employees until 16 other corporations, which are not parties to this case, either employ the Darlington's former employees or put them out of the preferential list, all until the last [Inaudible] upon trembles and to ultimate silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.273" offset="2680999">And why is Darlington to suffer that penalty?</text>
            <text syncTime="673.511" offset="2693956">Because it didn't furnish employment to these people after its resolution and its liquidation back in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.949" offset="2731781">Now, it couldn't furnished the employment because this plant was so peace mean that it was dismantled and its machine was sold and 99% of this machine that was sold to a corporation [Inaudible] and had no connection with the Milliken, in any way and it's not all it couldn't have done so as a physical matter, but it couldn't have done so as the matter of law, it had no legal capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.204" offset="2828748">Darlington was a South Carolina Corporation organized for the purpose of operation of a manufacturing plant to manufacture textbooks and the Act of the South Carolina Section 12-601 of the 1940 -- 52 Code which was in existence provides that when a corporation is dissolved in any matter, its life is continued merely for the purpose of liquidating its affairs and litigating causes of action arising prior to its dissolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.447" offset="2953718">And it says this, but it's life -- but it can do those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.159" offset="2964584">But it does not continue to exist for the purpose of continuing the business for which they were established.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.719" offset="2998857">So, it didn't have the physical capacity, it didn't have the legal capacity to do what is to be penalized for not doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="764.783" offset="3059043">I notice in the brief of the Solicitor General on page 4, it says this.</text>

            <text syncTime="782.725" offset="3130828">Thereafter, management engaged in a systematic and extensive effort to procure the Union's rejection.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.688" offset="3166668">On several occasions, threats were made by second-hands and overseers that the mill would be closed if the employees vote for union representation, just as of Milliken family had previously closed a plant in May” and then they cite about a dozen pages from the record to establish that, how do you handle that?</text>

            <text syncTime="817.795" offset="3271158">As a matter of fact, Roger Milliken had only one connection with this whole controversy prior to the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.877" offset="3299474">It was handled entirely by the general manager of the Darlington whose name was Jim Olan.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.997" offset="3319954">And the only connection of Roger Milliken had with it, was that -- he instructed Darlington's counsel, he was the president of Darlington.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.924" offset="3363631">He instructed Darlington's counsel to advise Olan during the campaign as to the law applicable to the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.400" offset="3393515">That's his only connection until after the election has been carried.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.008" offset="3407935">Now all that Roger Milliken did after that was to show that he was a diligent and a sincere person of Darlington.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.587" offset="3438341">He recognized that if there was a substantial number of the employees that will oppose to the necessary -- the increased use of labor, a more advanced and efficient use of labor in order to keep the mill in existence, that the mill could not possibly avail of the marginal nature of Darlington, could not possibly do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.811" offset="3535203">Now, those statements that were made were in an editorial, not what the Milliken said, but in an editorial which pointed out that in the controversy concerning Darlington, that the Union had assured these people that if they elected the Union it could never -- the Darlington could never go out of business and its management could not put into effect a program which was necessary for the economic survival of Darlington.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.326" offset="3633215">And all he said in that connection was that he called us to the attention of the managers of the other mills which operated during Milliken as a selling agent, that they all -- that they had full public relations in Darlington.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.239" offset="3688908">And the inference is that if he fails that -- it had good public relations, that the people of Darlington would have understood that the Union was trying to take over the management of the plant they have, and he -- and that they've [Inaudible] – the liquidation would not have been necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.798" offset="3755154">The economic situation will not come about and all he suggested was, there should be good public relations for the communities in which they operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.270" offset="3789009">That was instructions to the managers of plant and not to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.372" offset="3805414">I won't say that on this evidence that the decision of National Labor Relations Board has confirmed to evidence, is confirmed to the provisions of the Act and the interpretation based upon the Act by the National Labor Relations Board is inconsistent with the power of Congress under the commerce clause and repugnant to the due process clause of Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1269.621" offset="5078413">And so when the Board refers in these briefs to Milliken being the president of this and the president of that, this record shows that the relationship of the president in the textile business is that roughly corresponding to the Chairman of the Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="1347.108" offset="5388330">And in the course of that, that was introduced and used exclusively to show bias in respect of Milliken's motivation with regard to the closing of Darlington, who had Darlington as an independent unit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1389.593" offset="5558335">Now the Board here decided first, there was a violation at Darlington when Darlington went out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.305" offset="5601176">That was an affirmation of the holding of the trial examination -- the trial examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.900" offset="5627507">The Board reversely examined, however, with regard to the so-called single employer issue and held that there was a single employer presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.458" offset="5673796">The Court of Appeals, and incidentally those -- the decision by the Board was treated too with the two dissents as to the issue of single employer, and one dissent as to the issue of violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.299" offset="5741192">At the court below, we have the court below holding that Darlington viewed as an independent unit had an absolute right to go out of business, and that's holding number 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.712" offset="5786749">And then without deciding anything with respect to the fact on the single employer issue, the court below accepting the findings of the Board arguendo only, went on to hold that even in those circumstances so long as the going out of business was complete, unsigned, permanent, it was on the same parity or on a parity with the same problem as presented by Darlington viewing it as a separate unit on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.743" offset="5934916">Now, it seems to me that this Court has faced before the issue with respect to Darlington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.815" offset="5963233">What does it do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.085" offset="5968248">Does Darlington have the right to go out of business for any reason on this record, without violating this Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.487" offset="6005864">And it seems to me that although the Board has urged this Court that it may disregard that issue that it may not disregard it and it should face up to that as the primary issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.310" offset="6069185">Now, Mr. Manoli and Mr. Abramson have both asked this Court to proceed to the decision of the single employer issue before it, because I think it was Mr. Manoli who said it was fully briefed or I state to the Court with respect that it has not been fully briefed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.915" offset="6171585">In the first place, in spite of Manoli's assurance, when the -- when Solicitor General Cox put in the petition for certiorari here, he stated to this Court and to his adversaries as well, in the footnote on page 10, “Since the Court, meaning the Court of Appeals, did not consider whether the finding was sustained on substantial evidence, the issue would appear to be open on remand.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.431" offset="6297704">The second reason why we have not done it is because we have understood the rule of this Court to be starting with the Universal Camera, and ending with the United States or NLRB against Walton in 1960, this Court reviews the primary job that revealing evidentiary determinations by the Board to be the job of the Courts of Appeal and not of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.255" offset="6396970">And so, in preparing all the briefs on behalf of Deering Milliken for this Court, our only treatment of the issue of single employer is the treatment of an issue of law, and that issue of law is precisely this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.032" offset="6464052">The Board stated in classic terms and terms with which we do not disagree, that the tests for single employer are common ownership, common control of operations, common control of the crucial area of labor relations in such a way that a common enterprise, whatever that phrase means it's produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.364" offset="6573453">In oral argument to this Court, we have taken the first element, the element of common ownership because there the record is not complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.726" offset="6610860">It's based on a stipulation that appears in the record with regard to the share ownership by the Milliken family, the members of the Milliken family and where they own the shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.734" offset="6650880">And we make a contention as a matter of law, that if common ownership is an ingredient in the totality of a single employer status, then no case has ever held that any common ownership posture such as we find on these facts has ever been held to result in a single employer states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.124" offset="6760490">We have not argued the very -- we have not argued the very complicated facts on this record with respect to the risk of the single employer problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.489" offset="6825900">The court below -- in the court below, the Board's brief alone was 96 pages devoted to an analysis and presentation of the evidence on this single employer question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.996" offset="6879922">It's a long record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.562" offset="6886191">It's replete with many, many exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.870" offset="6899461">Some of the exhibits running 50, 80 pages in length and we submit that on this record, it would be going against this Court's own precedents, not to send this back if the Court disagrees with the court below on the issues presented as I have outlined them a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.618" offset="7002384">Now, I would like if I may, to turn to certain questions that were asked by the Court yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.043" offset="7068108">They were (Inaudible) proof of them, dealing with whether there was any evidence of any kind that business had been shifted from Darlington to any other plan connected with Deering Milliken Company or selling products through Deering Milliken Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.152" offset="7144594">And Mr. Manoli stated that he thought that there was some of what this record shows that in each instance, the only contracts that ever went to Deering Milliken and Company for -- or to a company connected with it, were first offered in the open market competitively, see if any other company would do it, and in the very few instances in which it did occur, sometimes Darlington paid a premium in order to get someone else to produce the particular goods in order to satisfy the claims of customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.778" offset="7299030">In other instances, Darlington itself paid the premium to the customer in order that the customer would in effect cancel out on the contract obligation at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.110" offset="7348349">That is the record with regard to it and the trial examiner spent some 12 pages of findings in this record with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.121" offset="7388473">And its conclusion was, that there was no substantial evidence that any part of Dalington's business found its way into the mills of Deering Milliken and Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.906" offset="7439569">Now in other words, when the court below said that this is not a runaway plant and they're -- that we are confronted here with a situation that a complete and permanent, I believe the Court was correct and on the records before this Court, what this Court should do is affirm the court below on the ground that when an employer ceases to be an employer and takes himself out of the coverage of the Act like taking himself out of the commerce covered by the Act, that that should be an end to it and that the penalty involved in going out of business should be regarded as to sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.007" offset="7636010">That same sanction should apply even when there are several plants involved so long as those plants are separate, self-sustaining economic units with a profit objective, because by going into bankruptcy or going out of business, the penalty on the employer is so great that it is not surprising that this is the first case in 20 years under the Wagner Act to produce this problem, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.433" offset="7745724">In other way, it's from the time the Wagner Act came into existence until 1956, this was the first instance in which an employer had taken this step with respect to a problem arising under the National Labor Relations Act and posed issue of illegality under that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.459" offset="7837780">So, I would ask if the Court agrees that it affirm the court below, but if it does not and cannot affirm the court below, and if it finds we are wrong in this contention, then I submit that the complicated problems of the single employer status should be remanded to the Court of Appeals as suggested in the petitioner's brief, bringing the case on certiorari here, on behalf of the Board and as urged in our own brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2390.829" offset="9563220">In that -- and I would suggest the answer to that is this. Like many other violations of the law, the sole and exclusive criteria is motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.018" offset="9620062">An employer may give a wage increase to an employee and not violate the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.779" offset="9643050">But if that wage increase is given to the employee for discriminatory purposes, he violates the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.044" offset="9668127">An employer may discharge an employee without violating the law, but if the purpose is -- is a discriminatory discharge, he's in violation of Section 883.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.397" offset="9713580">And therefore, I -- maybe I'm getting around the circle, but getting therefore to your Honor's question, if the motivation of closing down the plant is for the purpose of committing a violation of the law namely to frustrate the purposes of collective bargaining, then the Fifth -- central trust of the closing down is to violate the law and therefore it becomes unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="2462.734" offset="9850880">The trial examiner found very conclusively that if an employer is permitted to close down the plant, it undercuts the underlying principles of the right of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.755" offset="9898945">There isn't a single officer, be it administrative or judicial of the many people that handled this case that if it is agreed with the proposition that the finding that this plant was closed down for illegal purposes was not supported by substantial evidence, not a single officer, judicial or administrative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.339" offset="9985254">And the cases a clear, they are legion to suggest that the -- if you have a illegal purpose in shutting down, it becomes a violation of the law.</text>
