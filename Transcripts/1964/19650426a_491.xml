            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">-- of Section 305 of the Postal Service and Public Employees Salary Act of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.830" offset="39288">Is -- Section 3005 authorizes the Postmaster General directs them in fact not to deliver mail except sealed mail which the Secretary of the Treasury has determined to be "communist political propaganda" unless the addressee request the delivery of such mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.279" offset="145032">There are exceptions namely, federal agencies, there's government agencies, public libraries and certain institutions of higher learning.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.138" offset="192470">The appellant, Doctor Lamont is a writer and publisher of pamphlets and other materials dealing with public affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.388" offset="225489">In July of 1963, he received a notice from the Postmaster General in the form set forth at page 13 of the record in which he was called that a certain matter which had been determined to be "communist political propaganda" namely an issue of the Peking Review, Chinese publication had been -- had arrived and that it would not be delivered to him unless he requested his delivery by returning that notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.905" offset="351608">Dr. Lamont instituted this suit to enjoin the enforcement of the statute, this provision of the statute as unconstitutional for reasons which I shall indicate and this Postmaster General responded by saying that he regarded the suit as a statutory notice of a desire to receive this material therefore all “communist propaganda” so-called, or court found literature would be delivered to Dr. Lamont and the Postmaster General moved to dismiss the suit as moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.096" offset="492356">Following a longstanding policy indicated in the record of attempting to avoid a constitutional test to these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.911" offset="523598">The District Court by a divided vote by the statutory court upheld the motion to dismiss as moot on the ground that the basic injury, the failure to receive unless the request was made, no longer existed since the request had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.046" offset="596114">And that the other claim that the list of persons which historically had been kept which constitutes 20,000 a number at the present time, according to the record, of people desiring to receive "communist political propaganda" was not a really dangerous list which could afford any problem to the addressee.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.064" offset="676153">While this case was pending on appeal to this Court, a different District Court in the companion case in California, came to a different conclusion, holding that the issues were not moot, holding that the statute was unconstitutional as an impairment of the right of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.044" offset="748147">And holding that the list was a list of what might be called subversive persons or persons associated with them and therefore presented a deterrent to people requesting such materials.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.640" offset="842501">I shall address myself to that Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.025" offset="852010">Yes, while -- shortly after the Fixa case was decided, the Postmaster General for reasons that we don't question at all in terms of propriety, acquiesced in our view that the list at least were very harmful or might be harmful and adopted a new procedure under which he destroyed, he says he did and we accept his word, the existing list of names of people desiring such “communist propaganda”.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.584" offset="970292">Thereby, also revising the procedure so that nobody could receive the mail, by making a single request because for each piece of so-called “communist political propaganda” that arrives in the Post Office, a separate notice is sent to the individual and that individual whom we're sending that notice requesting the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.184" offset="1056705">If he says he wants it and the next piece of propaganda arrives, he must still send in another notice otherwise, the list would have to be kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.338" offset="1093277">On the other hand, if he says he doesn't want the propaganda, then a list is kept, this time what we will call a non-subversive list of people who don't want “communist political propaganda” and therefore will never receive them.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.113" offset="1148447">The action taken by the Postmaster General of course eliminates the issue of mootness which is not discussed in the Government's brief which I shall not address myself to.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.900" offset="1187527">It does however still pose a very serious question which we address ourselves in this rather brief argument to, namely whether the statute does not in terms of purpose, effect, and language directly as in Speiser, not indirectly as the -- such case as the ACA against Douds according to the Court's holdings affect and abridged freedom of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.154" offset="1300584">I shall obtain in a few minutes to the arguments made by the Solicitor General because they must be met here.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.337" offset="1325244">But let me begin preliminarily by saying that we think that the statute which allows the Government to say that certain kind of material coming from abroad will come in without any deterrent, without any request, without any delay, without any screening.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.648" offset="1402567">Let's take the New Statesman which soundly contains socialist propaganda in which on the other hand, says that material which is “communist propaganda” must be screened, must be read, must be translated, must be determined to be whether it's “communist propaganda” or not and then cannot be delivered unless a request is made by the individual that that does basically interfere as the Attorney General himself said to his representatives when this matter came before the Congress, it does interfere with our conception, our tradition of an open society.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.779" offset="1875069">Now, what we think is the basic defect to the statute is that it cuts under the principle that the Government must not determine or must not facilitate the reading of particular matter and to discourage in anyways slightly or greatly the reading of other matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.445" offset="1969737">And that this one is in a sense undercuts the principles set forth in such opinions as baits, where the Court talked about the consent of an informed citizenry because the informed must refer to information and the information is not to be the information which the Government wishes to discourage or encourage.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.457" offset="2053747">Of course, as the Court has held in Martin against Struthers, the right to read and to receive letter to is correlative to the right to write it and to distribute it.</text>

            <text syncTime="578.708" offset="2314762">Well, there is a license in the sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="582.529" offset="2330018">But the Court has spoken about licenses which you will get also as being improper (Inaudible) -- infringements upon speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.667" offset="2354573">You will get it if you make your request for it and of course this does cut right into the question of the writer of anonymity of the reader, a right which the Court held existed with respect to the distributor of literature and Kelly against California, circumstances far less invidious because they didn't involve the question of “communist political propaganda”.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.998" offset="2451958">Now, the Government's response which of course is a critical thing here is two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.969" offset="2479856">First, the Government says there's only a momentary listing and then it says there is not the slightest reason to (Inaudible) -- to anticipate government reprisal because a person is on such a list.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.813" offset="2535236">And it questions whether there would be much community reprisal either if these facts are known.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.933" offset="2563657">Our answer is that historically, under the prestatutory program which was eliminated by the order of President Kennedy and then resulted in the statute, the names of person's requesting the literature were turned over to various congressional committees and then of course generally speaking, there has been unfortunately in the last two decades a loyalty security programs interest in the reading habits of American citizens and this we have documented.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.469" offset="2709838">The fact that there is only a momentary request for the literature, doesn't exclude the possibility that the name will be noted somewhere because the Post Office may revert to its old practice, has changed its practice at least twice in this litigation, the moments are repeated moments instead of the single moment that we had when you could ask for all the literature because it is not true that you can now ask for all “communist propaganda”.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.296" offset="2821120">You must ask for the particular item.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.691" offset="2834704">The Customs Bureau which also has this literature and which has done most of the revelations to congressional committees in the past are the names of addressees makes no such commitment as the Postmaster General makes in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.593" offset="2882351">And more important, there is no assurance to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.049" offset="2904189">I think the Solicitor General was in error in his brief and it wouldn't make any difference if he weren't here.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.709" offset="2926759">No assurance to the public in the form of a writing or otherwise that the list of names will not be kept even if there weren't such an assurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.451" offset="2973780">Surely, the -- there are many people in this country who are sufficiently timid and with some justification I fear, not to want to ask the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.545" offset="3018083">The Government ascend what is labeled “communist political propaganda” because of the fear of consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.585" offset="3054237">Now, we think that under -- none of the standards which the various members of the Court have suggested can there be a justification for what the Government has done here in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1367.427" offset="5469623">And of course we send out much more to the so-called communist bloc and therefore we receive it, the United States much more postage than they receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.379" offset="5509433">But I don't regard that frankly as the critical argument here, nor do I regard the practical argument which is now available to us on the basis of the testimony given by the Post Office officials and Customs officials that this program is costing a half a million dollars a year even if we put aside the fact that instead of one letter there are sometimes three that “communist propaganda” comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.377" offset="5597414">The notice goes back and the mail goes out, a half a million dollars for the purpose of saving very little literature from going out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.859" offset="5639419">I consider even that argument not an important argument here and the basic one is the one that was made by Mr. Justice Brandeis dissenting in Burleson that was made in the Hannegan case that was made -- that is suggested in the dissent of Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.318" offset="5709218">Namely that you cannot use the subsidy theory, the second class mail theory as it was in order to screen political or economic content.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.785" offset="5759060">You cannot say that we will let the second, because of the subsidy argument we will let the London Economists come through and we will not let the Moscow Daily News.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.319" offset="5797198">Because here really is the Government determining how it will facilitate literature and the mails are not a faucet to be turned on full speed if the literature is approved by the Government and to be reduced in pressure if the literature is disapproved by the Government even though eventually it may sift through to the individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="1785.193" offset="7140728">I think it might be useful in clarifying the issues in this case if I were to begin by giving a very few words about the background of Section 305 even though we're concerned directly of course not with the background but with that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.397" offset="7221499">It's not necessary to go farther back except in very general terms than to the period during and shortly after the World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.684" offset="7274684">During World War II, a program of screening of foreign propaganda at that time, Nazi German propaganda was instituted by the Executive Branch on the strength of an opinion by Attorney General Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.178" offset="7340617">That program continued for a time through the 1940s and 1950s of being in its set up chiefly by executive and administrative action, and came in the course of time, I think it's proper to say to be directed at the communist countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.736" offset="7418880">In its beginning and in the early 1950s as I understand it, it did amount to a total blocking, if I may use that, suppression if you will, of “communist political propaganda”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.130" offset="7480424">There were many, many complaints including complaints from government agencies, educational institutions doing work at one time or another for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.132" offset="7528490">And during the late 1950s the program was changed in such a way that the addressees of “communist political propaganda” were as or whether they wished it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.580" offset="7578227">If they sent back an affirmative response saying that they did wish it then it were sent to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.680" offset="7602678">If they didn't reply or replied at the negative then of course it was not sent to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.857" offset="7627337">That state of affairs continued until the spring of 1961 when President Kennedy terminated the entire program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.048" offset="7672163">He acted on the basis of opinions from his Attorney General that there was doubt as to the statutory base for this program and from the Secretary of State as I recall it to the effect that this was impeding his efforts to workout cultural exchanging.</text>

            <text syncTime="2275.912" offset="9103569">And pursuant I think to that same general theme an exception over on page 32 makes the provisions of the Section inapplicable to public libraries or the Government and educational institutions of higher learning.</text>

            <text syncTime="3527.639" offset="14110511">I -- the case ought to be decided on the facts and not upon insinuations, speculations, but certainly, there's no such proof here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3590.535" offset="14362122">But there have been two difficulties as a result of the March 1st order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.188" offset="14380722">In the first place, there is the provision in the statue with respect to subscriptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.966" offset="14403814">I -- and the difficulty of administering that is very great because there are many things that are stamped subscription copy which aren't subscription copies, and the Post Office is trying to find a way of dealing with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.204" offset="14460761">Second, there is the provision in the statute which requires the Postmaster General not to detain the mail when he otherwise ascertains that it's desired by the addressee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.436" offset="14509662">And it would seem to me and I suggest the Postmaster General that if I were to write a letter saying, “I want you to deliver this mail and I want you to keep my mail on -- my name on file so that you can deliver it,” then there might be a real question whether he had any authority not to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.175" offset="14580611">Now those things I've stated exemptions just to be -- or to protect the Postmaster General in considering these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.428" offset="14613629">I repeat categorically, that with the possible exception of someone who says, “I want my name kept on file,” that there is no thought of reinstituting the old system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3814.997" offset="15259899">One is between the wisdom of legislation and the constitutionality of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.852" offset="15287380">I'm not here to argue nor this Court here to decide whether this is a sensible statute, whether it's necessary, or whether it's wise or whether it's foolish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.602" offset="15342341">Under our constitution, as everyone knows, but its worth recalling, the function of deciding whether a law is why this for Congress subject to the President's power if he don't, for the Congress alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.307" offset="15409215">And the second familiar precept that I would like to emphasize is difference, if I may put it this way without getting any disrespect, between fancy and fact, between broad and some -- therefore somewhat loose characterizations, and the actual impingement of the statute on some concrete interest of the plaintiff because it seems to us that viewed in terms of the concrete -- of concrete constitutional adjudication, Section 305 is really a rather minor regulation of the handling of unsealed mail from foreign countries developed by Congress to accommodate the conflicting interests of two groups of citizens both of whom or one of whom has to yield a little to the other unless the essential right of one is to be wholly overwritten by the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.251" offset="15660931">Now here, one group of citizens is worried and offended by the receipt of such unsolicited propaganda from foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.142" offset="15704503">These people object to the delivery of mail to themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.278" offset="15725087">Another group wants the “communist propaganda” delivered to them in regular courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.759" offset="15751001">Since most of this mail is unsolicited, indeed one estimated under the old program went as high as 90%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.798" offset="15783184">But since most of it is unsolicited, there's no way of knowing whether any particular addressee wants the mail or would be in the group worried about it and offended by receiving it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.185" offset="15840653">And in Section 305, what Congress in effect has done has said, “Let's pause and find out the addressee's wishes.</text>

            <text syncTime="4002.792" offset="16011076">After all, all that the plaintiffs are being asked to do is to exercise a little bit of patience, a led pencil, and to mail the postcard.</text>

            <text syncTime="4099.336" offset="16397270">First, that this was mail which many of the recipients did find offensive and did write to the Post Office and did write to their Congressman objecting to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.633" offset="16446485">Second, we are concerned with a subsidy going to the benefit of those who are publishing this on behalf of a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.720" offset="16506880">Now the -- I was going to go on and show, I'll state it now and elaborate it a little bit in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.001" offset="16527987">The only -- the affect that this has when one comes right down to it, is to withhold the subsidy of the -- generally speaking, second and third class mail because it's unsealed mail; from those publishing by and behalf of a foreign government of the opportunity to intrude this upon those who do not want it or who maybe to indifferent indicate that they do want it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.102" offset="16660376">And I think when it comes down to Justice Brennan, when one is all done with the way it operates is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.117" offset="16692454">On the one hand, there is some delay in terms of the recipient, average is two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.599" offset="16730384">On the -- also, on that side of it is a little bit of nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.819" offset="16747207">They do have to fill out the card and send it back, but that's all of the cards are then thrown away.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.614" offset="16782420">The interest on the other side that Congress were seeking to secure were first, even though it cost of money to see that everybody got what he wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.076" offset="16824216">They didn't want to finance foreign governments intruding communist propaganda on American citizens who didn't want it, who weren't -- who didn't desire it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.764" offset="16871027">And in the course of doing that, they not only avoid it giving those publishing by or on behalf of a foreign government a subsidy, but they did avoid offending the sensibilities of those who didn't want this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.696" offset="16938736">Now you say, “Well, we all get a lot of junk mails.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.074" offset="16948245">And of course, we all do get a lot of junk mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.919" offset="16963605">And perhaps, this is something that maybe proposed as the plaintiffs argued by saying, “Well, the amount of the injury is no greater than the distance from the mailbox to the scrap basket.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.930" offset="17019716">But I suggest that the -- that that is not necessarily true.</text>

            <text syncTime="4739.803" offset="18959151">Here, let's look at the various points on which the statute may impinge on First Amendment interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.141" offset="18992483">But first, as I see it, one can't call this in any sense censorship or suppression of what maybe sent in the mail.</text>

            <text syncTime="4776.284" offset="19105123">Now second, let's look at the thing from the standpoint of the senders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4782.523" offset="19129992">Anybody may send, there's no restriction on who may send.</text>
            <text syncTime="4787.673" offset="19150681">It might affect -- the only people affected by the application of the statute in this case, as I go back to my distinction between domestic mailings and foreign mailings, are people out of this country who are dealing with material published by or on behalf of a foreign communist party.</text>

            <text syncTime="4851.980" offset="19407830">Now, let's look at it from the standpoint of those to whom the mail is addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.422" offset="19437610">They are put -- they certainly are required to get a license or anything like that, the citation of Thomas and Collins and Lovell and the City of Griffin that seemed to me very far off.</text>

            <text syncTime="6302.928" offset="25211611">That's just the exact point I was going to raise that newspapers are not exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="6308.512" offset="25233972">But the general counsel of the Post Office testified before congressional hearings that they exempt newspapers, they exempt radio stations, they exempt televisions stations and they exempt magazines because they have made a decision that it's otherwise desired by these kinds of entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6326.831" offset="25307324">And I think they've made that decision very wisely because they would have one big squawk if they didn't make that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6333.625" offset="25334491">And it's the same thing they do as to any plaintiff who brings a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6338.143" offset="25352568">They've determined that he otherwise desires this mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="6341.933" offset="25367719">So anyone who squawks gets on the exempt list so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="6346.008" offset="25384020">But even if you're on the exempt list I want to emphasize your mail was sent to one of the screening units if it's from one of the country's designated, one of the 28 countries and it's delayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6363.252" offset="25452983">Now, Justice Douglas asked us, is the test, the source of the mail or is it the content and the answer you were given as the source of the mail, but I think that's the wrong answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6375.050" offset="25500108">The test is the content.</text>
            <text syncTime="6377.074" offset="25508258">The source does not matter so long as it is otherwise prepared on behalf of a nation which is a -- one of these nations as to which trade regulations are suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="6389.657" offset="25558622">So the test is the content that the content whether its “communist political propaganda” that is does it fall within the Foreign Agents Registration Act definition which is perhaps one of the most big statutes on our statute books.</text>
            <text syncTime="6405.752" offset="25622988">Now, did the lists go to investigators?</text>
            <text syncTime="6411.297" offset="25645140">There's no evidence that under the present program they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="6414.787" offset="25659141">There is evidence on page 19 of the yellow appellee's brief that under the past program they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="6421.756" offset="25686936">For instance, the counsel for the Un-American Activities Committee asks Mr. Fishman, “You have given the committee in private session list in great volume of the recipients of this “communist political propaganda”, have you not?”</text>
            <text syncTime="6437.116" offset="25748376">The answer to that is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6439.589" offset="25758302">Now, the Section 4008 program is a direct progeny of the former program as to which Mr. Fishman testified that great list had been given to the Un-American Activities Committee that we can determine by Senator Bush's comments when he introduced this bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="6460.959" offset="25843775">This is Senator Bush's bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="6463.205" offset="25852761">This is not Representative Cunningham's bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="6466.065" offset="25864255">Representative Cunningham provided the political pressure by attaching his bill as a writer to the pay -- postal rate increase bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="6475.243" offset="25900931">But Senator Bush put his bill into the Senate and this was the bill passed by the Senate and then Congressman Cunningham said he was satisfied with it and he accepted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6486.175" offset="25944607">Now, here's what Senator Bush said on introducing his bill which became this statute, “This legislation is needed to counteract the unfortunate effects of an executive order issued on March 17th, 1961 in which the President ordered an immediate discontinuation of a program to intercept “communist political propaganda” from abroad.</text>

            <text syncTime="7315.586" offset="29262263">And we've cited a case in our brief, the Gunovich case where American citizenship was denied to a man for one reason only, that is that he read a Yugoslav Communist publication.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="7351.547" offset="29406145">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7353.344" offset="29413355">Aside from two brief corrections of the Solicitor General mainly at page -- in our brief we cite a whole history of divulgence of names to the House Committee of American Activities, which I think Solicitor General will agree as the fact answer, he looks at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7369.074" offset="29476258">And the fact that cards as now used do not appear to one be subscribed by the addressee that his name will not be kept on the list though it's the fact which I indicated before would not be conclusive even if they did indicate it because the fear would still be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="7384.792" offset="29539161">The fact is that this present statute discourages the picnic if I can use that analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="7392.526" offset="29570090">If the picnic is to discuss a particular political philosophy and doesn't discourage other picnics, no court would hold that a state can discourage picnics on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="7403.531" offset="29614080">Secondly, the fact that it is a minor abridgement of speech as it suggested with which we disagree, there's no reason under this Court's decision for not applying the rule that there must be a paramount interest for even a minor abridgment of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="7417.385" offset="29669460">I don't recall the cases but it's been said very frequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="7420.878" offset="29683461">The definition of the vagueness of the definition is indicated by the admissions in the 1963 hearing of the postal authorities who have only the statutory definition before them, the rules and regulations of the Customs Department would simply incorporate that statute and they say, “We wish we had a definition for “communist political propaganda”.</text>
            <text syncTime="7442.467" offset="29769770">But far more important than any of these details or within the mechanical things of course and so forth, although I agree with everything that was said by my colleague here with respect to the discouragement which is proven both by people saying they don't want it and by people not answering.</text>
            <text syncTime="7457.842" offset="29831314">And I agree also that there's a radical difference between the injury to the person who simply has to send in a notice saying he doesn't want “communist pro -- political propaganda” and the man who affirmatively takes this position in request to get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7471.538" offset="29886067">Oh, I think this case should be decided on a broad philosophic and I do not agree with my learned friend here that policy and philosophy are not controlling in the case involving the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7484.170" offset="29936640">And the answer for me is found in three phrases.</text>
            <text syncTime="7487.720" offset="29950851">The first is Mr. Justice Harlan's statement in his Roth dissent which I take is the view of the Court for that -- which of course an obscenity case when he said, “The Federal Government has no business whether under the postal or commerce power to bar of the sale of books because they mislead to any kind of thoughts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7506.712" offset="30026815">And if you change the word bar to discourage I'm sure the principle is still applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="7511.948" offset="30047713">And the second is what Mr. Jackson's -- Justice Jackson said concurring in Thomas against Collins when he spoke to the fact that every man must be his own watchman for truth and that the Government cannot step in to separate the true from false.</text>
            <text syncTime="7525.893" offset="30103510">And finally of course where we always turn to and what is so applicable in this, alleged minor interference with a particular political or economic or social point of view would the tacit encouragement of all other points of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="7540.113" offset="30160353">Although we denied foreign assistance to France next year, the Gaul's literature will also come under the statute as “communist political propaganda” even though no one regards him as the communist, the statute would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="7552.531" offset="30210090">And Lamont would not commend if it said anything about our current policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="7556.582" offset="30226286">I end with what Mr. Justice Holmes said if I may Mr. Chief Justice, in the Abram's case, and these are not words, and this is not just mere philosophy.</text>
            <text syncTime="7568.588" offset="30274351">He said, “While that experiment, talking about our democratic system in the First Amendment, is part of our system and I think that we should be eternally vigilant against attempts to check, to check the expression of opinions that we loathe and believe to be fraught with death, it's hardly true of this literature that way; unless they so imminently threaten immediate interference with the lawful and pressing purposes of the law that an immediate check is required to save the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="7603.844" offset="30415308">No one here suggests that the country's salvation depends upon the statute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7609.664" offset="30438609">And the purpose of the statute if I may conclude was stated so well by Senator Johnson, the late Senator Johnson, the chairman of the committee which ultimately put through his compromised bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="7621.953" offset="30487719">When he didn't say it's to save money and he didn't say it's to save sensibility but he said and we have quoted in our brief, “is to blot out”.</text>
            <text syncTime="7631.229" offset="30524813">Think of those words in the American system, a blot out, the delivery of “communist political propaganda” through United States mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="7641.200" offset="30564728">And that included in one day under the pre-statutory program, the London Economist and it included a article on chest for the Soviet Union and who knows what will come next.</text>
