            <label>Mr. Ewell Lee Smith, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="24.276" offset="97071">It is a very high professional honor for me to appear before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.152" offset="116506">I'd like to say at the beginning that I'm fully aware of the importance of the question to the jurisprudence of our country to be decided here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.859" offset="147435">I hope I may be of assistance to the Court and that I may do justice to the cause of my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.178" offset="172617">This is an adoption case, first to be considered by this Court on adoption validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.426" offset="201665">It is important I think because we are mobile people, historically on the move and adoptions have become very numerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.155" offset="232594">It is important because it involves domestic law, one of the chief categories of the law since the Code of Hammurabi and before.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.684" offset="262687">There are two points involved and two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.720" offset="274808">First at Section 6 of Article 46a, Texas' revised statutes is constitution because it purports to dispense with the consent of natural parents in an adoption proceeding without any provision for notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.562" offset="330188">Secondly, that we have been deprived of due process of the law that the failure of the Texas Courts to give notice to the natural father of a proceeding to adopt his child.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.224" offset="372820">Not only do I appear here in a representative capacity for the bench and the Bar but our petition for a simple, direct, and specific justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.254" offset="408973">I shall address myself first to the facts, secondly to the procedural facts, thirdly to the law, and lastly to the possible and actual consequences of harm from this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.315" offset="465189">My client was made rather late in life.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.110" offset="476369">He is the natural father of but one child, a girl, the subject of this adoption.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.735" offset="494864">His wife who had been married once before and had mothered and lost the custody of two children by her former husband, divorced him in Fort Worth, Texas in November of 1959 and received custody of his only child subject to the usual rights of reasonable visitation in my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.799" offset="567171">At the time of the divorce, my client suffered complete physical and mental breakdown.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.748" offset="590890">He was carried to the hospital by his just divorced wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.283" offset="605100">He was not to recover from this condition for over a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.991" offset="619938">His former wife had been moved to El Paso, Texas some 550 miles west of Fort Worth and within four months after the divorce, remade for the third time to a Mr. Manzo, a divorced man with three smaller children.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.466" offset="677825">She took with her Molly, age three, the child of my client is subject to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.310" offset="705202">Now my client Mr. Armstrong is a native of Fort Worth, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.885" offset="719517">He's lived there for over 40 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.912" offset="727562">His parents have lived there for many years before him and all are well-known.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.027" offset="748042">Texas has an adoption statute which provides among other things that no child maybe adopted without the consent of his natural parents unless such parent or parents shall have voluntarily abandoned said child for two years and shall have left the child to the care, custody, and control of others, or in the disjunctive, such parent shall not have contributed substantially to the support of such child during such period of two years, commensurate with his financial ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.436" offset="869669">It is the second of this that we're concerned with here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.956" offset="883775">When he was divorced, my client was ordered to pay $50 a month child support beginning November 16th, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.386" offset="909479">It is undisputed that he paid as total sum of $200.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.335" offset="925257">This would have carried him from November 16th, 1959 up until March the 16th, 1960, some four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.036" offset="960052">The trial court and the appellate court by some subjective or otherwise unascertainable standard, even though the divorce was not decided until November 6, 1959 and the payments were not to begin until November 16th, 1959, decided that the payments were for -- from November the 1st, the date prior to the divorce itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.521" offset="1053989">And therefore, two years from the four-month period ending March the 1st the Court said, Section 2 of the statute came into operation, he had not -- if he had not supported the child commensurate with his financial ability from that period on, then they had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.703" offset="1122743">This was the first, and in my judgment, most fundamental jurisdictional decision made by a series of Texas Courts apparently calculated to reason around or to ignore constitutional rights and guarantees a due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.877" offset="1187422">If the Court please, I think it was a studied attempt to run this adoption through against the wishes of his father without notice to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.026" offset="1224098">Now, let me make it clear now that this is not a custody case and again the classical sense of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.255" offset="1257012">There should have been no issue concerning the welfare of the child in his adoption in the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.689" offset="1274671">Custody was with the mother by decree of the District Court of Tarrant County, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.602" offset="1302361">The father did have limited custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.206" offset="1312810">This limited custody consisted of a court order giving him reasonable visitation at reasonable times.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.484" offset="1333917">I mentioned that because although it's not classically custody, it does have elements of custody in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.703" offset="1354710">The issue here is simply, whether a Court can completely cut the man off from his own child without even the right of visitation, taking away his name, his heritage, his parentage, terminating if the Court please in the words of Section 9 of the statute, all legal relationship, all rights and duties, all against his will without even notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.454" offset="1445721">The procedural facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.195" offset="1456692">With one small capsule of time on March the 12th, 1962, three events took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.963" offset="1483755">First, the mother filed at two sentence self-serving affidavit, alleging nonsupport of the child for two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.929" offset="1511654">This was filed in 120th District Court in El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.412" offset="1525551">On the same day, the judge of the 41st District Court next door found nonsupport solely on the basis of his self-serving two sentence affidavit and granted his consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.122" offset="1568392">Now, I neglected to say that if these two events come to pass in the statute then the parental consent shall not be necessary but the consent of the juvenile judge or the Judge of the County Court if there is no juvenile judge shall be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.559" offset="1618233">So the judge of the 41st District Court on the two sentence affidavit gave his consent to the adoption which had meanwhile then filed in the 120th Court on the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.944" offset="1663687">All of these three events took place on March the 12th, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.023" offset="1688033">No inquiry was made concerning Mr. Armstrong's whereabouts.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.652" offset="1706527">No notice of any kind was given him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.320" offset="6481189">The error that was made here arose from the fact that our party's then counsel either misconceived of what the cases and felt that they could go ahead and get a judgment that would be good or for some reason advised the people to go ahead without notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.190" offset="6556735">But that was an error because the Texas cases are clear in numerous cases that that judgment was only good until it came into question by the party whose notice had been omitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1695.696" offset="6782746">And so he wrote and therefore, the petitioner came in and filed a -- what was first hold, a motion for new trial or a motion for new trial and a motion that the judgment be vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.012" offset="6843977">Now in regard to a motion for new trial, we are talking about an instrument that was filed and called a motion for new trial as a name or a motion to vacate the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.141" offset="6892460">But what actually transpired here is that the judge set down for a hearing the motion that they had filed and then postponed the hearing on it so that the parties could go to Fort Worth and take their positions and on a date certain, set the motion again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.536" offset="6962051">And then the parties came in and put on testimony from live witnesses and from deposition witnesses so that there was a full scale hearing where the judge set again to determine the facts that were essential or in issue in this adoption.</text>
