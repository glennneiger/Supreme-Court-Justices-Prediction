            <label>Ms. Barbara A. Morris</label>
            <text syncTime="189.782" offset="759118">I think there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.612" offset="762358">I think that it points to that and I will make record references as I go on to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.519" offset="778031">You will recall as far as the facts are concerned that the first description of a Negro driving big black car, given by the complaining witness and which appears in the -- that portion of the transcripts, 158 and 159 which is the original statement of the complainant, where the party was asked that -- when were a party advised them that the person driving the car was involved in discussed segregation, his statement, and I would read it to the Court, is they knew who I was talking about right away, he said he was involved with NACP or something and the same theme prevails this case throughout it and I don't think that it is of -- not in the sense of importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.029" offset="996101">I don't think this is glaring as some of the other errors here, but I think that this last issue, I think demanded that it be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.142" offset="1028493">Apart from the conduct of the investigation in which whatever original statement the complaining witness made never appeared because there was no original affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.200" offset="1084709">And I think the clarification that there was a tailoring considering the difference between the writ use of the complaining witness's original description of what happened and his final testimony at trial, so that the defendant -- a crime was made the fit the defendant ultimately.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.134" offset="1152522">There was an illegal arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.366" offset="1161404">It was a denial of a right to subpoenas where there is supposed to be a compulsory right of process.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.086" offset="1184287">There was a refusal of the Court to desegregate the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.916" offset="1199647">The attitude of the Court is clear from the record, the addressing of Negroes' by their first name.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.576" offset="1222217">Finally, conviction of a Court lacking jurisdiction and the major point in this case which is the conviction of the defendant on illegally seized evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.795" offset="1267148">First, reversed by the Court below and then affirmed by the Court below which admits that this evidence was in fact illegally obtained so that, that issue was not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.924" offset="1311660">I would like to devote myself to the jurisdictional question because I think it could be built within less time, if this Court permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.905" offset="1347605">It's elementary to the Court of Mississippi because it so states that trial by a Court lacking jurisdiction is a fundamental denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.513" offset="1385953">It also raises Fourteenth Amendment issues, that under the statute of Mississippi and Justice of the Peaces or jurisdiction begins with the lodging of an affidavit and that's in accordance with 1832 of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.590" offset="1450318">In accordance with 1205, he is required to send all original papers to the Trial Court, and in accordance with 1200, he is required to certify that, that record is the original record.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.960" offset="1499742">In this instance, the petitioner was arrested on March 3, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.939" offset="1527745">He was held overnight in jail until March the 4th.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.556" offset="1538194">On March the 14th he had a hearing before the Justice of the Peace whereupon he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.383" offset="1561496">The only affidavit in the county court, the trial court, whose jurisdiction is dependent upon that of the Justice of the Peace's Court, was an affidavit filed by the county attorney dated March the14th which neither reflect that it was on information and belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.490" offset="1633907">Now, obviously put, it had been on personal knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.880" offset="1655432">So that under the Law of Mississippi even consistent with that part of it that as mentioned in the opinion of the court below, the Court lacked jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.677" offset="1694616">It did not decide the jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.020" offset="1704020">Actually what it did was define an amended affidavit and in finding an amended affidavit based on certain representations of counsel which were not confident testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.767" offset="1746965">It did so in violation of its own law which has specific requirements for amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.379" offset="1773505">The first of which is that an original be produced or the individual who supplied the original before whom it was executed and who supplied the contents in answer to a complaint, testified to it from personal knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.841" offset="1831288">By some processes of invalid reasoning the opinion of the Court below requires petitioner to prove the jurisdiction of the Court to which he continually objected, so that we raise this not only on the due process grounds, but also that the reading of the law and application of the Law in Mississippi which is in violation of it's own statues, is a denial of equal protection of the laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.505" offset="6573976">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.691" offset="6594664">First on the subject to the affidavit, you will find the statement in the record and it's repeated in the opinion of the State Supreme Court and I make note of it on page 9, I believe it is 9, at the top of the page there a very short brief to the effect that the defendant's attorney admitted that an amended affidavit was properly substituted for the original.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.404" offset="6717544">Now, that having been done, naturally there was no question raised along the route anywhere about the whereabouts of the original affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.984" offset="6763833">I'm going to proceed here from if it just please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.498" offset="6789956">After conviction as appeal in a trial de novo and these books certified to the county or the Circuit Court as the case maybe, all the papers that it has in the thing and in this case, they only certified up the amended affidavit the one upon which it was tried and very logically so and understandably so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.336" offset="6861322">And when they started looking for the original affidavit nobody could find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.196" offset="6880758">But he was tried on the amended affidavit which was furnished to counsel which was taken by them and which they agreed had been substituted for the original.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.657" offset="6918583">So that amended affidavit even if there were no other or even if it were faulty give it to full jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.863" offset="6963409">Admittedly, there was an unlawful search of this petitioner's car by the chief police of Clarksdale, Mississippi, after the petitioner had been put in jail and the complaining witness had related his story in order to nail down the evidence so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.010" offset="7043971">The Chief Police went to the petitioner's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.543" offset="7062152">His wife came to the door and he asked her could he look in his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.822" offset="7079288">The car was locked and she went in and got the key, gave him the key and she and her mother and father and her daughter, I think about nine years old came out there and they watched as the chief police unlocked the car and looked in and corroborated to him operable condition of the cigarette lighter the complaining witness had told about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.033" offset="7164029">He had also stored about two ash trays up there, one on the driver's side and one on the passenger's side, and the one on passenger's side had a lot of red chewing gum wrappers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.378" offset="7201437">Well sure enough the chief reaches over and it had bunch of empty chewing gum wrappers and he says what is this?</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.634" offset="7222439">And there his little daughter speaks up and says, oh, I put those at Wednesday, I believe she said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.895" offset="7247517">It is strongly corroborated of the mere fact that the boy was in the car with the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.585" offset="7270296">It's not essential to his conviction I believe that Mr. Justice Clark mentioned that the testimony of the boy himself being sufficient.</text>
