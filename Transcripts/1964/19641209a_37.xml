            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="26.048" offset="104176">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.181" offset="112640">This case is here on writs of certiorari to the Fourth Circuit, the Court have been granted the petitions of both the Labor Board and the Textile Workers Union to review the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.190" offset="172722">A number of issues have been posed in this case, but as we view this case in its present posture, we think that the only issue, which this court need breach is whether an employer violates the prohibitions of the Labor Act against coercion and discrimination when he liquidates one of several commonly controlled units of his business, because the employees in that unit have selected a bargain representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.609" offset="286407">This question subsumes the answers to two subsidiary questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.586" offset="306260">The first, whether the employer here liquidated the particular unit in question in reprisal against the employees for having chosen the Union to represent them and in order to escape his statutory duty to bargain collectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.035" offset="368118">And secondly, whether the particular unit or plant mill actually here in question was part of a larger business complex under such common control and ownership as to constitute the whole a single employer for purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.833" offset="439275">Now, the board answered all three questions in the affirmative and concluded that the liquidation of the Darlington Mill, that's the Mill we're concerned with in this particular case, the liquidation of the Darlington Mill was an unfair labor practice within the meaning if Sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the Labor Act.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="132.914" offset="531644">Did you say the question being presented, if Darlington, at this side of its former business who is the only employer to buy and to liquidate it under this circumstance, that question is not purported?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="149.152" stopTime="194.993">
            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="149.152" offset="596532">We believe you don't have to reach that question Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.020" offset="608026">Now, the Union in this petition did present that question and the Court of course granted the Union's petition as well as ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.608" offset="638328">We ourselves did not present that issue and on the view that we take of the Board's subsidiary findings with respect to the single employer and respect to the motivation, we believe that you don't have to reach the issue of whether a single employer, an employer owning a single plant whether he's entitled -- whether he can go out of business even though it may be for anti-union reasons and not violate the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.063" offset="732160">Of course, I'll make no secret of the fact that the Board itself has concluded that even in the case of a single of an employer owing a single plant, going out of business altogether, that that's a violation.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="194.993" stopTime="199.014">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="194.993" offset="779912">And the Board's opinion in this case can be read to embrace that, I think.</text>

          <turn speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="199.014" stopTime="488.421">
            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="199.014" offset="796003">I think the Board's opinion in this case goes on alternative grounds, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.075" offset="812199">Because in the opinion you will note that after the board has discussed whether or not there was a violation on the basis of Darlington having been the only employer in this case and on Page 18 of the record, that's Volume 1 Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.219" offset="884820">On Page 18 of the record, the paragraph just above the black letter, 85 violation in which the Board there indicates that it is going on alternative grounds, the one that Darlington was the only employer and that in any event, it was part of a larger complex which constituted the whole complex, one employer for purposes of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.451" offset="965799">Now, as I say, the Board answered all three questions which I've indicated in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.408" offset="989623">A majority of the court below accepted the Board's findings of the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.588" offset="1006341">It assumed arguendo, the Board's findings with respect to the two subsidiary questions that I've indicated namely motivation and the single employer status, but it rejected the Board's ultimate conclusion, there was an unfair labor practice here.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.464" offset="1065796">There were two dissenting members who would have upheld the Board on all three counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.534" offset="1094113">In the limited time that I have, I'm afraid that I can sketch the facts which give rise to the controversy only in the most skeletal fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.241" offset="1140924">In March of 1956, the Textile Workers Union began to organize the employees of the Darlington Mill which was located in Darlington, South Carolina and despite the most intensive efforts on the part of supervisory personnel to coerce the employees into rejecting the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.873" offset="1215425">And these coercive efforts included numerous warnings that the plant would close down if the union won.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.061" offset="1236219">Despite these efforts in majority of the employees voted for the Union in a Board Election which was held on September 06 of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.794" offset="1271118">Roger Milliken, who is the President of the Darlington Mill and other organizations that I will come to in a moment in this case, Roger Milliken was immediately informed of the Union's victory and on the following day before the Union had made any demands, whatsoever, on the following day he decided to recommend to both the directors and the stockholders to liquidate the Darlington Mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.256" offset="1368921">The upshot box that on October 17 of that year, a stockholders meeting was called, was held, to consider a resolution to liquidate the Mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.139" offset="1428480">Roger Milliken informed the stockholders of the Union's victory in the Board Election.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.356" offset="1449378">He also stated that he had decided to liquidate the Mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.849" offset="1467350">Roger Milliken at this meeting held 65% of the stock, either in person or by proxy of the stock of the Darlington Mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.070" offset="1508206">6% of their stock was owned by Roger Milliken and the members of his own immediate family, 41% was owned by Gary Milliken and the 18% was owned by Cotwool Manufacturing Company and the members of the Milliken family and the Milliken family consists of approximately 27 individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.772" offset="1579050">They owned the majority of the stock in both Gary Milliken Company and in Cotwool.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.940" offset="1599739">The Directors –- the stockholders rather voted with a few dissenting votes, I think something like a 135,000 of shares voting for liquidation and 3,000 of shares voting in against liquidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.237" offset="1644878">The stockholders very promptly voted to liquidate the Mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.732" offset="1662851">Now, Milliken testified that the economic outlook of the Darlington Mill had not been altogether satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.418" offset="1697646">But I think the record shows as the Board found that until the Union won the election, the Milliken interest had not intended to close down the Darlington Mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.297" offset="1737143">In fact, during the nine months preceding the election which was held in September of that year, during the nine months preceding the election, the Milliken -- the company has spent nearly a $0.5 million dollars modernizing the plant and Roger Milliken himself testified and I think this is a fair summary of this testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.530" offset="1806106">Roger Milliken himself testified that the unionization of the employees triggered off the decision to liquidate the Mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.662" offset="1834632">And indeed, after the stockholders meeting, when he was asked why he was closing the Mill in view of the fact that 83% of the employees following the board election had indicated they were prepared to work with or without a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.850" offset="1887399">His answer was, that as long as there was this hardcore of 17% labor people in the Mill, he refused to run the Mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.493" offset="1925956">The Mill discontinued operations in November and in December, the machinery and equipment was sold at auction.</text>

            <text syncTime="768.528" offset="3074090">From day to day, the fact is that it is Roger Milliken who holds a range of this entire empire in his hands and that it is he who exercises a very pervasive and comprehensive control over the entire operations of the business including his personal as well as his labor policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.669" offset="3142635">In fact, the decision to liquidate mill was essentially his.</text>

            <text syncTime="844.275" offset="3377006">And coming back to briefly what the board found in this case, the board found first that the liquidations of the mill was prompted not by economic considerations as argued by the respondents, but by the purpose to escape the duty to bargain collectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.309" offset="3441162">Secondly, the Darlington and Deering Milliken constituted by virtue of the interrelationship constituted a single employer for the purposes of this Act and that both were responsible for the violation for the unfair labor practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1052.637" offset="4210521">However, the majority only accepted these findings arguendo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.250" offset="4224940">And in our petition, we ask to this Court to accept those findings also arguendo and to deal with a legal issue on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.017" offset="4252003">However, I may add that all of the parties that have addressed themselves, so those two issues, the motivation and the single employer and while we were reluctant to burden this Court with the determination and ultimate resolution of those subsidiary issues that the Court feels and find to address themselves to do -- to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.330" offset="4317309">Did I say the parties have brief the issues and I don't know if there's much more that any of us can say upon those particular issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.897" offset="4343536">I will not discuss further the single employer issue here, because I want to go on to other matters in the brief time that I have, and I'm afraid this is running very fast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.546" offset="4390139">The -- I started with a premise that the Board's findings of anti-union motivation and the single employer's status are correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.400" offset="4433502">And in that posture, then I believe that the issue that we have here is whether an employer whose business embraces a number of plants violates the statute when he liquidates one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.093" offset="4480313">When he liquidates one of them because he is afraid of the unionization of his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.589" offset="4502256">Now, one of the basic guarantees of the National Labor Policy is the right of employees to engage in concerted activity and to select representatives for purpose of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.305" offset="4557218">It's long been settled, it's long been recognized that this guarantee is impaired if not vitiated, if an employer threatens to close his plant, if his employees become unionized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.979" offset="4603820">If he temporarily closes his plant in order to get rid of these union employees or if he transfers a plant from one location to another in order to avoid collective bargaining or finally if he transfers work to an independent contractor because the employees performing the work for him have become unionized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.009" offset="4671948">Now all of these illustrations involve the exercise of so-called “management prerogative.” But the underlying principle is, that an employer may not use his -- either his economic power or his so-called management prerogatives in order to coerce employees in the exercise of their rights under statute or to discriminate against it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1362.989" offset="5451860">And these employees totaled close to 19,000 in that vicinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.685" offset="5470668">By this action, they served notice upon them with the price of the present or continued employment in the Deering Milliken Complex was a surrender of the rights which guarantees to employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.118" offset="5520405">And I submit Your Honor, that it is not within the par of any employer to impose that price as the condition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.410" offset="5549558">Now, we are told that an employer cannot be compelled to remain in business and that if he's willing to pay the price of foregoing profits and the foregoing other business advances, then he's free to discontinue any phase of his businesses regardless of whether his purpose is to avoid the unionization of his employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.202" offset="5632731">In the first place Your Honors, there's nothing in the history of the Act or its philosophy that remotely suggests that discrimination or coercion becomes something less or that they're excused because the employer is willing to pay the price for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.581" offset="5690305">If the theory that it hurts the employer more than it hurts the employees were a valid theory, I suggest that even a discriminatory lockup would be valid under this theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.159" offset="5740565">Under the theory that it hurts the employer more than it may hurt the employees, because it's temporarily closed to close down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.469" offset="5765851">But apart from this fact, the critical factor in this case is, that Deering Milliken, the employer in this case, Deering Milliken has not removed itself from the economic arena.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.473" offset="5817887">It is merely liquidated one unit of its wide scale business and has continued to engage in the same kind of business of which Darlington was an essential part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.281" offset="5865117">Any one of the 26 mills of the Deering Milliken complex is potentially free to pick up the business of Darlington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.598" offset="5898344">And as I indicated a moment earlier, in fact after Darlington was liquidated some of these mills picked up, some of Darlington's unfilled contracts, and also picked up some business, at the moment I don't know just how much, also picked up some business from some of the Darlington's former customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.779" offset="5967099">Now, if that is a respondent's argue, the abandonment of an effort to get the profits to obtain other business advantages is the test of whether or not there is a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.605" offset="6014328">I suggest Your Honors that test is not met here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.199" offset="6032718">Analytically, this case is not really much different than the case of an employer who discharges, let us say 10% of his employees, because they'd become unionized and it continues to operate, perhaps at a reduced capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.421" offset="6081620">In both cases, the employees who have elected to exercise their statutory rights have been punished, in both cases, the employer is continuing to do business and in both cases he has served notice upon the employees that their livelihood depends upon the refraining -- they're refraining from exercising their statutory rights and in effect giving him immunity from the statutory obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.860" offset="6179422">Now, as I indicated earlier, the Board is of the view that even the total discontinuance of a business for anti-union reasons is a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.649" offset="6226547">But I suggest Your Honors that even if we assume for the sake of argument, the total discontinuance of business, in case, whether an employer removes himself altogether from the economic arena because he is unwilling to live within the framework of the National Labor Policy, even if we assume that the answer there that it's not unlawful for him to do so, I suggest Your Honors that's not necessarily decisive of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.879" offset="6319438">Because if as respondents continually remind us, if economic suicide is the test of whether or not there is violation in this type of case, I suggest Your Honors, the employer in this case is very, very far from being debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.272" offset="6381087">Now, this does not mean of course that an employer may not discontinue a part of his business or any part of his business just because it happens to be unionized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.732" offset="6426854">He may discontinue his business for any of the -- any legitimate economic reasons or indeed out of sheer caprice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.501" offset="6457992">The critical factor is more than.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.559" offset="6470217">Now, the respondents argue in this case here, that they were prompted by economic factors and the argument is, that the unionization of the employees and the possible economic burdens that the employer could anticipate from the unionization of the employees is the kind of legitimate economic factor that an employer can take into account and act upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.766" offset="6566975">Now in the first place, this argument I think flies in the teeth of the Board's findings, which where that the employer here liquidated the Darlington plant, not because of economic factors but by a purpose to escape, the duty to -- and the statutory obligation to bargain collectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.170" offset="6636669">But apart from that, the argument would really subvert the statute, because quite often an employer's hostility to unionization of his employees comes down to a matter of dollars and cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.748" offset="6702916">Now, if an employer could say that the unionization of his employees and the anticipated economic burdens that unionization might bring, that that were the kind of legitimate economic factors on which he could act, then I suggest Your Honors that there's nothing to prevent the employer from discharging his employees as soon as they join a union.</text>

            <text syncTime="1724.709" offset="6898834">He has explored his economic package and it might well be said that having explored that economic type you should -- knowing what it's going to cost to live with the union and at that point, it maybe that is -- the decision to go on is prompted by what might be regarded as legitimate economic considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.415" offset="6977620">But I'm saying Your Honor that we don't certainly reach that issue in this case here, because there was never any attempt, never any attempt to bargain with this union.</text>

            <text syncTime="1797.977" offset="7191824">In addition to that, because they say -- I don't see how an employer at this stage -- at this stage of the game where Union has won election, they haven't even gotten it to the bargaining table, where the employer can say, well, I think that I -- that the employer can say at that point, “well, the economic burdens of the unionization of my employees that it will not permit me to stay in business and I'm going to go up.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.819" offset="7287223">If you permit him to do that, it seems to me, then you're really have sacrificed the employees' interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.397" offset="7305509">Now it maybe that, when you come to the bargaining table and the union's package and it's fairly clear what it's demanding that maybe at that point the employer can go out of business without being charged with an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.211" offset="7352842">But short of that point, I don't believe that the employer can be permitted to say that the unionization was the kind of an economic factor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sam J. Ervin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2155.959" offset="8623752">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.632" offset="8646426">In my brief time, I hope to address myself to essentially two aspects of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.460" offset="8673802">One is the remedy which is of extreme importance to the union and the other thing is that I hope that I would be successful in putting to bed any suggestion by the employer that they close this mill for economic purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.439" offset="8737750">As a matter of fact, before I get into any of the issues here, I want to suggest that Mr. Manoli was rather modest in his suggestion that the record contains some suggestions as he says that the other plants were closed because of the union activities of employees noted during the mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.627" offset="8834508">When the Court gets a chance, I recommend that they read pages 115 to 117, Volume III and there is demonstrable evidence that there were a number of closings of the mills during strikes, the evidence of which came from the mouth of Roger Milliken himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.629" offset="8918413">As a matter of fact after reading this record, the conclusion is inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.842" offset="8939311">Now what you got here is a Milliken formula for destroying unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.538" offset="8958119">Just closing Darlington is just one of a number such mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.982" offset="8979853">This -- this medium, this weapon, and the arsenal of all the economic weapons is rather new as far as Mr. Milliken is concerned and I say no for the past 10 years he has exercised it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.478" offset="9037845">But I'm going to get through some of the evidence of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.362" offset="9045368">Before I do, let me suggest however, that what the union objects to insofar as the board's remedy is concerned is that we feel that the board's remedy is inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.274" offset="9101061">The board's remedy we feel falls far short of dissipating the course of impact of the Darlington shut down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.964" offset="9131781">We suggest the modification of the board's order, so that the board will direct the reestablishment of the Darlington Mill or in the alternative, put the City of Darlington on a preferential list so that in the future when Deering Milliken deals a plant as they do very frequently, as I will demonstrate, they will select the City of Darlington whom they almost demolished by the shutdown as a preferential matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2328.022" offset="9312026">I suggest that when Deering Milliken builds another plant, then I might say that this is not an infrequent indulgence on the part of Deering Milliken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.199" offset="9352777">We have evidence, for example, if you examine page 1333 of General Counsel's Exhibit 13, you'll find the heading by Deering Milliken, “10 New Mills during the Past 10 Years.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.153" offset="9408575">Now, moreover, in 1963 they spent $45 million in purchasing and acquiring 7 or 8 mills from Textron.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.437" offset="9445669">The point I make is that in this frequent purchasing and building of mills, it's not an unreasonable suggestion that the next mill that Deering Milliken Mills, they should build in the City of Darlington which so far they turned into a legacy or the Mohawk Valley and that is not an unreasonable request.</text>

            <text syncTime="2413.230" offset="9652872">The only difference I suggest between the two is that Preston -- that is Preston Feed involved three workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.572" offset="9686204">Deering Milliken involved 500, I don't assume that there's a difference in the eyes of the law between treating a small corporation and directing the reestablishment of division as against dealing with a giant corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2677.684" offset="10710727">In which he encloses an article from this American Textile reporters and asked them to read it carefully and to bring -- which will bring about an understanding of your mill and its problems in your community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.080" offset="10764225">And it's suggested you read more carefully the latter portion of the article which he encloses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.631" offset="10794423">Let me read just two parts of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.419" offset="10809574">On page 180, if you please, the second paragraph everywhere the same story was repeated, “If the only the Union had left our people alone, we could have gotten along fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.474" offset="10869864">The man who pumped the gas at the gas station had a wife, and a mother who were working in the mill.</text>

            <text syncTime="2729.709" offset="10918766">And finally, I think this Court would be interested on page 182, the concluding paragraph in the middle there of when the article says the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.417" offset="10961607">“When Dallas Manufacturing Company of Huntsville, Alabama became unionized, the Millikens liquidated it contrary to the opinion of the many local people that such would not be the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2771.153" offset="11084591">Now, this is a memorandum sent by Roger Milliken to the heads of each of these affiliated mills to bring it to their attention, but for what purpose?</text>

            <text syncTime="2881.192" offset="11524702">That before the trial board, Deering Milliken and Darlington came in and said that Darlington and Deering Milliken has common control, they conceded it in that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2905.487" offset="11621878">They denied common ownership and admitted that Roger Milliken, the force of this whole outfit could have controlled as against having actually exercised the control.</text>

            <text syncTime="3080.185" offset="12320705">I do want to address myself now to the question of remedy, which I know the Courts is extremely interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.753" offset="12346932">It should be remembered in answer to the questions asked by this court that Deering Milliken was only one of four mills who produced print cloth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.821" offset="12391236">So that when it shutdown a mill of one of four, it was analogous to my humble judgment, to merely shutting down a department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.130" offset="12428434">Now, if the Milliken formula becomes law, all it means is that any large corporation having a department incorporated, if that gives it any special status in the eyes of the law, closes down, it then gives to that corporation immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.630" offset="12498442">And I hope I'm not presumptuous in asking this court the rhetorical question as to whether or not the board's decision in this case doesn't setup demurrer, that if a company is big enough, if it's rich enough, if it is wealthy enough to close down on mill and meet the liability of back pay, it then can close itself with immunity from liability under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.866" offset="12631458">And I ask also what kind of remedy is it that permits Deering Milliken who set out to destroy the union and to set out to destroy the collective bargaining rights to retain the fruits of that objective, which he does under this particular decision?</text>

            <text syncTime="3558.477" offset="14233809">And presenting Darlington's cause, I seek to preserve this economic freedom, not only for Darlington, but for all Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.665" offset="14278635">The chief industry of my state, North Carolina is the Textile Industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.543" offset="14302145">Some 230,000 of its funds and dollars earned livelihoods for themselves and their families in the Textile Industry of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.338" offset="14349270">It is obvious I think that North Carolina and every other Textile producing state and the people of those states would suffer drastic economic injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.764" offset="14414994">If it should be held in this case that the National Labor Relations Board has the power under any circumstances to compel a Textile Manufacturer to remain in business against his will until the last drop of economic blood was squeezed from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.400" offset="14529515">I say this because such an adjudication would minimize to the highest degree the creation of future jobs in the textile industry, because it would discourage new capital investments in the textile industry and it would eliminate thousands of jobs now in the textile industry by spurring the dissolution of textile plants of a marginal nature and by stimulating and accelerating the omitted automation in the highest degree of all other existing textile plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.551" offset="14742152">As the lawyer for Darlington, I fight for the preservation of economic freedom for all Americans, and I fight to protect North Carolina and all other textile producing states and their people against serious, drastic, economic injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.318" offset="14825221">Now, it will do well for me to make it plain, what is not involved in this case, I think that Mr. Manoli has well admitted that Darlington is not a runaway corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.789" offset="14887079">The trial examiner found as a fact that Darlington went out of business completely, permanently and irrevocably and that no evidence was produced on the hearings indicating that his business was being carried on by any of the other corporations using the services of Deering Milliken as a sales agent in any other form or in any other place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.816" offset="15007242">That finding was approved by the board itself, the board said as approved all of the findings of the trial examiner except those, which is specifically rejected and it did not reject that specific finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.160" offset="15056562">And when this case was before the court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals laid this matter to rest for all time by this statement, which appears upon Page 686 of its opinion as reported in (325 F.2d) Item 325 Federal Report of second series.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.669" offset="15138586">The trial examiner demonstrated beyond debate, that Darlington was not a runaway plant, that is a plant having another existence in another form, finding that Darlington was not hidden among the other Milliken operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.964" offset="15203788">No disagreement with this finding was or on substantial evidence could have been made -- could have been expressed by the board that -- now those two questions, there are two questions involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.135" offset="15260526">The first is whether Darlington, Darlington's complete and final withdrawal from business was a violation of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.592" offset="15302322">Second, whether Darlington's withdrawal from business even though final and complete was a violation of the act, because of relationships alleged to exist between Darlington on the one hand and Deering Milliken as well as certain other corporations on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.067" offset="15392183">It's my purpose as the Counsel for Darlington to argue the first of these questions?</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.972" offset="15411827">The second will be argued in detailed by Mr. Updike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.777" offset="15427082">I shall merely allude to the second question by calling the attention of the Court to the fact that the National Labor Relations Board itself laid down the correct rules for determining whether there is a single employer status existing between Darlington and all of these other mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.301" offset="15505136">Incidentally, the National Labor Relations Act would require the employment of these people dischargement in Darlington eight years ago, by sixteen other separate corporations, which have not been made parties to this case and haven't been given notice of the case and have been given no opportunity to be heard, which seems to me is enough to cause Daniel Webster to call in his definition, the procedural due process in the Dartmouth College case to turn over in his grave.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.003" offset="15631987">Here's what the National Labor Relations Board correctly said about the single employer status. It is now well established that for two or more big remittances to constitute a single employer for purposes of assessing liability for unfair labor practices, it must be shown that there was a sufficient degree of common ownership and common control of Labor Relations and Operations so that they maybe said to have -- that they engaged in a common enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.550" offset="15778168">Every law book I have ever seen and every dictionary I've ever consulted, says that in order for two or more persons to be engaged in a common enterprise, they must have the right equivalent to control and direct that common enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.408" offset="15841593">And yet to say Darlington is engaged in a common enterprise with sixteen other manufacturing corporations and it didn't have any power to control it and which it never did control, we have a research corporation which it couldn't control, we have an engineering corporation or service corporation which it didn't control and whose services was not obliged to take and with the sales agent, Deering Milliken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.427" offset="15949636">There is not a scintilla of evidence in this case that Darlington had any control over any of those other corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.942" offset="15975758">Furthermore, there was no common ownership, the stock in Darlington was owned -- 31% of it was owned by people who were not named Milliken, who were not related to Millikens by blood or marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.901" offset="16047543">And who didn't have so far as this evidence shows a single penny invested in any of the enterprise in which any other Milliken was involved, 31%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.020" offset="16096026">And when it came to a vote to dissolve this corporation, there were 200 stockholders not related in any way to Millikens and not involved in any way with these other 19 corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.702" offset="16162795">And of that 200, only four appeared in personal by proxy to vote against dissolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.538" offset="16194142">And one of these people who appeared was Mr. Simpson, a merchant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.489" offset="16209920">Head of the Simpson Belt Stores in Darlington and who represented, as I recall, and through the record, approximate 20,000 shares of stock beneficially or personally and who voted to liquidate not withstanding the fact that the prosperity of his mercantile establishment was dependent on the prosperity of Darlington.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.033" offset="16300095">People don't cut off their economic noses despite their economic face or the economic faces of anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.062" offset="16340219">All the desires of labor, they don't do it, and just to show that there's no common ownership, Darlington was an isolated mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4095.508" offset="16382015">There's one other mill, one of these mills in that neighborhood and and that was Arch.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.569" offset="16406256">And if this order of the labor board was carried out to compel these other men to offer employment to these people, most of them would go to Hartsford because it's the nearest one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.928" offset="16451709">And the evidence shows that 45% of the stock in Hartsford was owned by people who were not Millikens, who were not related to the Millikens, and so far as the evidence shows did not even have a penny invested in any other enterprise in which any Milliken was entrusted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.319" offset="16525270">Now, the truth of it is, this Court should hold as a matter of law on the evidence in this case that the cause of Darlington's going out of business was economic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.429" offset="16581695">The trial examiner would have held that if he had not been mistaken as to the law applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.135" offset="16616490">He said this, Volume I Page 65, he's speaking of the economic factors, which Darlington had insisted, showed that this mill went out of business for economic reasons and not for discriminatory purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.245" offset="16692976">The trial examiner says these factors -- the factors cited were sufficient to support a decision to terminate operations, certainly it cannot be said that such a decision could not reasonably or even unreasonably, but credibly would be based on these factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.826" offset="16771239">Then he added, proceeded further, he concluded that the decision to close Darlington could not be held to be based on economic factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.419" offset="16821603">Although, the economic factors justified as closing, because he said, “The decision to close would not then have been made.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.860" offset="16867370">If it has not been, “for the union's victory.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.940" offset="16883670">In other words, the trial examiner said this, the economic situation was sufficient to justify a closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.156" offset="16912614">But, because they closed on that day, as a result prompted, the decelerating cause, the last one could follow the group on camel's back was the union victory and because it didn't operate until the sun rose and set a few more times, he couldn't hold that it was economic in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.134" offset="16984503">And when the case came before the board, the board made a similar situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4264.704" offset="17058795">No, that's not critical to my case, because I'm just saying no, that this Court ought to end this case by holding as a matter of law in this evidence, that it due, the closing was due to economic causes, but of course I would say in the next place is not critical, because the power of Congress to regulate the labor relations between the employers and employees is based solely upon the interstate commerce clause and Congress has the power to regulate the conduct as long as they are engaged in the interstate commerce or in an industry affecting interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.723" offset="17218873">But, they have the privilege of withdrawing themselves from business and withdrawing themselves from the regulatory power of Congress and it's the National Labor Relations Act as attempted to provide for the regulation and to compel people remain in business after they had to go back into business after they had withdrawn from business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.093" offset="17288359">It would exceed the power of Congress onto the constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="4334.055" offset="17336216">But at least I was arguing this and the more detailed problems and I should, was a fact that the reason the trial examiner reached the conclusion he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4342.309" offset="17369234">And the reason the Board reached the conclusion that they had, they had thought that as a matter of law they could not consider the union victory as an economic event under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.400" offset="17409567">And therefore, and since it participated in the decision to some degree, that therefore they had to hold, it was an illegal discriminatory closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4362.406" offset="17449587">Now, the facts of this case, show it is economic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.888" offset="17463484">This is the old mill, it was built about the time that Grover Cleveland was inaugurated President of the United States for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.109" offset="17504340">It had become practically obsolete before the 1930's depression.</text>
            <text syncTime="4381.077" offset="17524297">And during the 1930's depression it became indebted to a sales agent, Milliken Deering and that's the only capacity Milliken Deering has as to Darlington.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.738" offset="17562854">And it was put into bankruptcy and it would have gone out of existence, staying except for the fact that Milliken Deering agreed to take its debts in stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.664" offset="17606635">That's the way they became acquainted with this mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.845" offset="17619278">Now, the textile industry flourished during the Second World War for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4409.481" offset="17637878">In the first place, the government bought up most of their products.</text>
            <text syncTime="4413.009" offset="17651984">In the second place, they had no foreign competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.027" offset="17664104">In the third place, there was no price competition, because the old PA fixed prices on all of their products.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.616" offset="17690436">As soon as the war was over, there was a period that comprised of prosperity in which anybody with a textile mill could make some money, because there was a great backlog of all the civilian demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.271" offset="17741009">It had been prevented from being fulfilled by the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.367" offset="17753443">But, after that there came a period of decline in the textile industry and it became a sick industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.056" offset="17776222">As a matter of fact, since 1946, the close of the Second World War, the jobs of 440,000 textile workers have been liquidated and gone out of existence in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.109" offset="17832333">One-third at least have gone out as a result of the closing of 670 separate textile plants of a marginal character like Darlington.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.907" offset="17879562">And the other two-thirds have gone out as a result of automation and the more efficient use of labor by reason of new machineries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.997" offset="17927941">Now, Darlington, during the -- two years before Darlington went out of existence, we had a cut in the tax on textiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.075" offset="17972245">It was the theory of those in control that we had to keep a viable economy among our allies, Japan in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="4500.428" offset="18001711">And so, they cut the tax on textiles and an additional 25% to 50%, this was following many other cuts that had been made since the passage of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act and it almost brought the tax down to nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.027" offset="18060016">And then two years later in January of 1946, the United States adopted a policy under which by an export subsidy on cotton of foreign competitors of Darlington and other mills could buy cotton of American government in effect of people getting the subsidy of American government, $0.06.5, $0.07.5 and $0.08 a pound.</text>
            <text syncTime="4538.683" offset="18154684">They bought their cotton at 75% of the price that which American textile product producers or manufacturers had to buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4547.256" offset="18188957">And that took effect in January 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.867" offset="18211422">Now, two years before Darlington went out of business, there was an increase of over 200 -- of over 125% in the imports of textiles of the character that Darlington was manufacturing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4567.047" offset="18268160">And at the same time, there had been rehabilitation lodged at the dispense of the American taxpayers on the aid programs of all of the old textile industries of the free world and then they had expanded this industry into the undeveloped countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.130" offset="18328451">And they had modern cotton mills with modern machinery largely bought from American, the American foreign aid program and they could get new mills for 50% of the cost of American replacements at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.200" offset="18380800">And during 1954, two years before Darlington went out of business, there were 94 textile plants which went out of existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.670" offset="18418625">The next year, 101 and the following year about 100 or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4610.927" offset="18443703">And so, this was a very hardest period on the textile business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.073" offset="18460212">Now, Darlington considered going out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4618.484" offset="18473900">The year before the union appeared upon the scene and to make -- they considered seriously and finally called in an independent engineering firm, Bates firm, and they made a survey of the mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.168" offset="18532624">Darlington had concluded that the only possible way that it could stay in business was to have modern machinery and to have -- make a more effective use of this labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.844" offset="18579331">And so, Darlington called in this engineering firm, because Darlington, only had been making two and eight tenth percent upon this investment during those years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.931" offset="18623634">And so, they called in this firm and this firm said that the mill floors was sold in such a condition, so insufficiently constructed and so antiquated that they would not stand the vibration of high speed modern textile machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4674.680" offset="18698658">So, Darlington embarked then on a program that was contemplated an expenditure of $400,000 to modernize its mill and it took in full concrete flooring to support some of these looms, to have the modern speed looms and what had been a supply room on the ground floor, because the other floors of the building had been in use wouldn't support them, according to the engineering firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.884" offset="18799491">And it was embarked on this expenditure of $400,000 recognizing that they had the modernize machinery and they had to make a more efficient use of the labor, which the union called a stretch out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.001" offset="18859990">And so they came -- the people, there was a substantial minority which opposed any change in job assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.243" offset="18892904">They wanted the management to carry on in the old way and although Darlington spent thousands of dollars in an attempt to modernize its carving room and its spinning room, that it didn't get the economic results from it, because of the reluctance of the minority of these employees to do -- to engage in a more efficient labor and the use of more machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.909" offset="18999589">Now, this was a substantial outlay for Darlington, because this total property at that time was betted at only $2,100,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4759.810" offset="19039190">And so, then the union came up on the scene and started the organizing campaign just about the time that the results of the American, of the subsidy program started to take an effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.909" offset="19091540">And the union promised these people and they won the election on the basis of their promises that they would see to it that the management made no changes in the job assignments there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4784.077" offset="19136261">In other words, the union pledged these people that Darlington, that it would, if the union won, they told them that if the union won, that Darlington could never go out of business not even until the last lingering echo of Gabriel's horn sounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.712" offset="19202821">They told them that they'll see that, that the only program that was possible to save Darlington economically was never cut out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4808.131" offset="19232496">That is the more efficient use of labor in connection with new machinery and as a result of the decline on the products of Darlington, they discovered that they were suffering a substantial loss because there was a decrease of $0.06 a pound in the 7900 pounds of textile products they produced during the period between January and September of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.681" offset="19358720">In addition to that, the administration had promised to do something about the importation of cheaply manufactured textile products from abroad, the rest was all from Japan where the workers got $0.12.5 an hour or 10% of that then paid in the American industry and that area of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.791" offset="19443148">And as a result of that promise, the sort of manufacturers agreed that they'll have a general raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.535" offset="19466136">And as Darlington had stayed in business, even in the absence of the union, it would have made, had to have made an increase in pay to the conform to the general peace throughout the industry that would have amounted to $120, $1000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4882.212" offset="19528829">Now Darlington, had been making about $80,000 a year which is less than two and eight-tenths percent on this investment during the preceding five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.446" offset="19573760">And if it is going to account as a modernization program, it not only had to make this expenditure of above $400,000, but it had to take in effect other expenditures, because with the change of technology and with the change of styles and with automation, there's a great change that had come into the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.758" offset="19654949">For example, Darlington had been specializing among other things in the making of PK and as a result of the technological change, his competitors had bought machinery in which they could avoid the expenses as the manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4930.858" offset="19723389">Buy new machines through which they could run any kind of cheaply made cloth and make the same effect, get the same effect as PK without the elaborate processes which Darlington had.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.844" offset="19771350">Furthermore, the customers on the market stopped buying -- became in this favor, the woven cloth upon the narrow looms, the only kind Darlington had.</text>
            <text syncTime="4953.303" offset="19813146">And as a part of this program for modernization it had purchased and had on hand at that time for installation in the newly concreted portion of the supply room, 80 looms which was about 10% of the number of looms it had, the wide looms that it could operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.505" offset="19893917">Now, on top of this, they found themselves confronted by the necessity even in the absence of the union of increasing wages of $120,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.393" offset="19933518">They found they were going to sustain a loss as a result of the decline of their products of $240,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4991.200" offset="19964761">Then, they also knew that they were going to have to spend $800,000 in the near future if they stayed in business to air-condition the plant and make other vast improvements in order to increase the wide looms above 80, the number 80 they didn't have on hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.985" offset="20031843">And on top of this situation, this company was confronted by the advent of the union, which had pledged itself to the people that had voted for them to see to it that the plans which Darlington had and which was the only plans that could possibly permit Darlington to remain in existence as an economic unity were never carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.029" offset="20132049">And on the face of that fact, the trial examiner and the board took the position that they had to ignore the existence of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.576" offset="20170292">And if they considered the advent of the union upon the scene as an economic factor in association with these other economic factors and reach the decision they couldn't operate economically that, that was an unfair labor practice, that's the holding of this Board, that's what it says the basis of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5060.087" offset="20240300">It says it had six genuine, that Darlington had six genuine economic reasons apart from the advent of the union for going out of business at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5068.680" offset="20274678">But, it held and violated Section 8(a)(3) of that in going out of business completely and permanently and in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="5077.210" offset="20308741">Now, I respectfully submit that this Court ought to hold in the first place as a matter of law, that this going out of business was based on economic conditions and that the decision of the trial examiner and the decision of the Board to the contrary was based upon the misconstruction of law, because there are at least 12 cases we cite in our brief that says that an employer can take in consideration the advent of the union as an economic fact in determining whether it's possible for him to stay in business on an economic stand point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.755" offset="20462968">Then, I say this, that Congress recognized that it only had this, the power to pass this act on to the Interstate Commerce Clause, and they don't have the right to make regulations of employers, litigation in private business as long as they elected to engage in interstate commerce or in an industry affecting the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.763" offset="20550949">And Congress knew that when they went out of business, that their power to regulate ceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.827" offset="20587207">Now, this is not a case that involves the power of Congress to create a crime or a cause of action while one is engaged in interstate commerce, which will survive the going out of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.452" offset="20633704">That was no discharge of any employees here for discriminatory reasons that is for the union activities, the only reason that these people were discharged because their services were no longer needed for the operation of the mill, which was going out of business and when this Bill was before the Congress, the legislative history shows that during the debate on the house floor, that Congressman Taylor of Tennessee.</text>
