            <label>Mr. Marvin M. Karpatkin</label>
            <text syncTime="31.438" offset="125701">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.283" offset="173035">This case is here this afternoon, because two practicing attorneys in the Commonwealth of Virginia have been summarily convicted of contempt of court and their conviction is sustained by the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia for filing and arguing a legitimate motion for a change of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.761" offset="266971">Although, both of the petitioners are attorneys, Messrs.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.964" offset="279824">Holt and Dawley, this particular motion to change venue was made in the proceeding where Mr. Dawley was the litigant and he was being then and there represented by his law partner, Mr. Holt as attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.923" offset="339592">It is our principal claim that since this motion was wholly legitimate, there is nothing whatsoever contemptuous in the record concerning this motion to change the venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.989" offset="391941">That these contempt convictions are deprivations of constitutional rights under the Due Process Clause of the right of the litigant to have the affective assistance of counsel and of the right of the attorney to vigorous advocacy in his client’s cause, in both cases by the same improper judicial act.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.679" offset="482638">Furthermore, since the Court saw fit to act summarily, without resemblance or any scintilla of a hearing with just no hearing at all and since this was not one of those special situations where this Court has held, summary contempt proceedings are constitutionally permissible, we urge that this was a further and separate denial of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.102" offset="596323">The facts maybe stated rather briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.859" offset="615340">Messrs. Dawley and Holt were two members of the three-man-partnership practicing in Norfolk, Virginia in the fall of 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.082" offset="660271">Litigation pending in the Circuit Court of the City of Hopewell involved clients of the firm, the case of Hopewell News Inc. against Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.199" offset="708754">This was a defamation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.660" offset="718576">The defendants were represented by Mr. Dawley in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.851" offset="735399">There was an allegation in the record that the purpose of this defamation case was to destroy an organization in the City of Hopewell called “The Hopewell Improvement Association”, an organization consisting of many of the Negro citizens of the City of Hopewell dedicated to -- efforts to bring about the constitutional requirement of racial desegregation in accordance with law and in accordance with decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.063" offset="844173">And as an allegation in the record, that the purpose of this lawsuit brought by the Hopewell News alleged in the record to be the only newspaper in the City of Hopewell, was a reflection of a considerable amount of community tensions and hostility extent in the Hopewell area at that time where there were an effect lined up on the side of the plaintiffs in this Hopewell News against Harris litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.298" offset="945110">What was in effect the pro-segregationist power structure of that area and the defendants consisted of Mr. Harris and others, leading members of the Negro Community, officers and active persons in the Hopewell Improvement Association generally represented by the firm of Jordan, Dawley, and Holt and in this particular defamation case represented by Mr. Dawley.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.942" offset="1043749">In any event, Your Honors, the case was called for trial on October 05, 1961, the defamation case and on October 06, 1961, a dismissal was entered on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.358" offset="1097352">Following this dismissal, the presiding judge, the Honorable Carlton E. Holladay subjected Mr. Dawley to a series of questions, which either were not answered or not answered to the judge’s satisfaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.855" offset="1155344">I believe in one instance, Mr. Dawley stated he wanted some time to consider whether he should answer or what his answer should be and this led somewhat later on the 11th of December 1961, to Judge Holladay issuing a show cause order directing Mr. Dawley to appear in show cause why he should not be held guilty of contempt of court for this refusal to answer Judge Holladay’s questions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Marvin M. Karpatkin</label>
            <text syncTime="331.307" offset="1325140">There is a suggestion but the record is hardly clear that the non-appearance of these defendants, who were called as witnesses by the plaintiff, had something to do with the dismissal of the litigation, but it is not clear from the record since the questioning did not proceed and indeed since no hearing was ever granted and so we don’t know what would or would not have transpired on the record, had these questions been further gone into the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.426" offset="1441646">On the 27th of December 1961, Mr. Dawley filed a motion to disqualify Judge Holladay.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.174" offset="1472679">This motion was filed by Mr. Dawley pro se.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.455" offset="1485740">After due deliberation on the 28th of December, the motion was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.146" offset="1504549">Then on the 17th of January, Mr. Dawley again pro se filed the instant venue change motion, which appears in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.151" offset="1536522">This motion came on for hearing, I should say, Your Honors I'm sorry, the contempt trial came on for hearing on the 30th of January 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.381" offset="1581453">At that time, as the record indicates, Mr. Dawley’s appearance was as a litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.773" offset="1599007">He was represented by his partner Mr. Holt.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.866" offset="1611442">Dawley sat silently throughout the entire proceedings and the Judge asked for -- the Judge stated that he was prepared to hear argument, prepared to consider the motion for change of venue, which as I stated had been previously filed since 13 days earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.746" offset="1682913">And the record indicates that Mr. Holt then and there proceeded to read into the record, virtually verbatim, the motion which has been previously filed -- the written motion, which had been previously filed by Mr. Dawley pro se.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.785" offset="1751040">Immediately upon the completion of this reading, the Judge stated that he held this motion contemptuous and subsequently certified that the reasons why he held it contemptuous were the following allegations contained in the motion, and these are contained in the motion as filed 17 days earlier and as the filed motion was read into the record, I beg your pardon, 13 days earlier as read into the record 13 days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.334" offset="1865247">The first allegation is that the -- is the claim that there was a judicial amalgamation of functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.932" offset="1891683">The precise words which apparently were taken very -- which apparently the Supreme Court of Virginia as well as the Commonwealth in its brief takes great umbrage at the words “Is now in effect and/or in fact acting as police officer, chief prosecution witness, adverse witness for the defense, grand jury, chief prosecutor and judge.”</text>
            <text syncTime="493.873" offset="1975484">This was a portion of the allegation on the motion for a change of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.782" offset="1991053">And they observed parenthetically that these words seem to be suggested by the opinion of -- the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Rutledge of this Court in the case of ‘In re Oliver’ invalidating the Michigan one-man grand jury statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.687" offset="2046746">The second allegation in the venue change motion, which the judge considered contemptuous was the allegation that this particular judge had harassed and intimidated Mr. Holt, the attorney appearing for Mr. Dawley.</text>

            <text syncTime="628.357" offset="2513398">The final allegation in the venue change motion, which the judge found contemptuous, was the allegation that a fair and impartial trial could not be had in the Hopewell Circuit Court under the circumstances then existing.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.457" offset="2565747">Subsequent to the finding of contempt, an apology was tendered, about which I'll have some more to say later, which was in effect, we urge a disclaimer of any intentional disrespect for the Court, a statement in effect that we say what we have to say in order to do our job as attorneys and produce the legal effect of a venue change motion, but that no respect was subjectively intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.177" offset="2676611">In any event, after sentence, the -- both contempt convictions were unanimously affirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia and this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.311" offset="2717153">We urge in the first instances, in the first instance that, this is a denial of rights under the Due Process Clause, because in as much as there is a constitutional right to counsel, sustained by this Court over and over again and which the Bar has admonished continually by the cannons of ethics of the American Bar Association and that this right to counsel includes the attorneys right of advocacy, indeed the attorneys duty of advocacy as well as the client’s right to have zealous representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.260" offset="2856960">That since there was absolutely nothing wrong with this motion, since this motion was perfectly legitimate and met all of the criteria of legitimacy, that to label it ‘a contempt’ to poll that there is sanction worthy conduct in a legitimate motion of this nature is a denial of constitutional rights, a denial of the right of effective counsel.</text>
