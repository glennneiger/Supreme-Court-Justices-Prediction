            <label>Mr. James L. Highsaw, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="64.271" offset="257045">The basic question presented to the Court by this case is one of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.222" offset="292885">The issue is what forum, if any, has jurisdiction to determine whether a collective bargaining agreement between the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks and Capital Airlines terminated from the merger of Capital into United Airlines on June 1, 1961 are whether that agreement survive the merger and can be enforced as an obligation against United Airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.707" offset="426736">The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which is under review in this case and the positions of the parties as presented to the Court, four different answers to this basic question.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.478" offset="497894">The Brotherhood has taken the position that jurisdiction lies in the federal courts on a suit by the Brotherhood to enforce this agreement against United Airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.160" offset="556617">The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit took the position that the federal courts do not have jurisdiction, that exclusive jurisdiction rested in the National Mediation Board because it's said that the dispute involved a matter of representation and a representation dispute over which that board had exclusive jurisdiction under Section 2, Ninth, of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.963" offset="667794">United agrees for that position but United goes further.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.606" offset="686393">United says that the dispute isn't justiciable at all and it also says that if it is justiciable at all, it should have been litigated in a petition before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the order of the Civil Aeronautics Board which approved the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.139" offset="776464">Finally, the United States' amicus curiae on behalf of the National Mediation Board, says that the National Mediation Board does not have jurisdiction over this dispute that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that there was a representation dispute involved there over which the Mediation Board had jurisdiction, that the federal courts do have jurisdiction entertained the Brotherhood's complaint but only to enforce the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement which provide for a Board of Adjustment and a grievance procedure to hear grievances of employees arising out of the agreement and that the ultimate jurisdiction to determine how much of the agreement survives, rests in this adjustment board.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.363" offset="1005401">At this time, I will to address myself to the position of the Brotherhood and of the United decision of the Court of Appeals and I will address myself on rebuttal to the position of the United States after the Solicitor General has given his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.401" offset="1073528">I think that in order to carefully understand the issues, it would be in order to very briefly in review some of the relevant facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.571" offset="1114279">In 1947, the Brotherhood became a duly authorized representative on the property of United -- on the property of Capital it is, on certain of the employees of Capital, the office, the clerical, the stores and the passenger service employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.711" offset="1194841">Thereafter, it negotiated the collective bargaining agreement with Capital that under the Railway Labor Act, covering the rates of pay, the rules and working conditions of these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.269" offset="1244996">In 1959, it entered into negotiation with Capital to revise that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.077" offset="1272268">There was already in the win -- the prospects of a merger by Capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.775" offset="1291076">There had already been one aborted merger agreement entered into which had not been finally processed before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.959" offset="1323781">So, the Brotherhood bargained for and it obtained in this collective bargaining agreement in 1959 a provision to the effect that all provisions of the agreement should be binding upon successors and assign of the Capital.</text>

            <text syncTime="379.131" offset="1516460">That's right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.981" offset="1539866">About a year after, this agreement was ordered, one other provision of the -- this agreement relating to successors and assigns as Article 1(b) in which this provision appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.018" offset="1592007">In addition to the provision that it was binding upon successors and assign is also an additional provision providing that there should -- in the event of a consolidation of a merger, there should be a negotiation to the procedure to be followed and the protection to be accorded the Capital employees and that 90 days notice was required to the Brotherhood for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.878" offset="1695451">About a year after this provision was put in the agreement when the revised agreement became effective in August of 1960, Capital and United entered into a merger contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.835" offset="1743308">One of the provisions of that merger contract obligated United to assume all the liabilities of Capital without any exclusion or exception for any collective bargaining agreement and without any exclusion or exception for this particular collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.660" offset="1814570">In addition, both of these corporations were Delaware Corporations and under Delaware law, a surviving corporation is required to take over the liabilities of the non-surviving corporation and this law does not contain any exclusion for collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.228" offset="1892833">The Brotherhood heard about this merger through the newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.490" offset="1905894">This is in the record, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.719" offset="1914776">And shortly thereafter, it advised both Capital and United that it was invoking the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, that it wanted to have negotiations with them either singly or jointly for the purpose of implementing this agreement and reaching a decision on the procedure to be followed and the protection to be afforded and employed.</text>

            <label>Mr. James L. Highsaw, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="501.754" offset="2006936">This was immediately after the merger agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.686" offset="2018743">The merger agreement was signed on the August 11th, The Brotherhood read about it in the newspapers in August 12th and it sent these letters out on August 16th, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.128" offset="2072451">Both carriers refused to have any meetings with the Brotherhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.400" offset="2093558">The Brotherhood during the period of the next year and up to the time the complaint was filed in this case, made repeated efforts to have negotiations and discussions with either Capital or United or both working on this subject and was not for a slight refusal.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.351" offset="2157401">Without going into all the details and brief the position of the United was that it had no obligations and no duty to assume the obligations of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.789" offset="2199092">The position of Capital was that by signing a merger contract that it put itself in position where it couldn't do anything effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.826" offset="2239216">The merger agreement had to be submitted to the Civil Aeronautics Board for approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.984" offset="2255935">The Board under the Federal Aviation Act has a general authority to impose reasonable terms and conditions that approved the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.363" offset="2289371">The Brotherhood intervened in this proceeding, two purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.554" offset="2306194">One, it sought the ordinary employee protective conditions that the Board imposes when it approves the merger which are in modification of the Washington Job Agreement in the railroad industry in which I'm sure this Court is thoroughly familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.932" offset="2371709">And the Brotherhood also asked the Board to impose if it approved this merger a condition requiring United to take over this collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.976" offset="2411833">It argued to the Board as a matter of law, United was required to take it over.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.304" offset="2433149">The United argued to the Board that it -- as a matter of law, the agreement terminated when the merger was consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.987" offset="2483931">United also argued to the Board that the agree -- that the question was not one for proper disposition under the Federal Aviation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.498" offset="2529907">The Board approved the merger which the Brotherhood did not opposed, it imposed the employee protective conditions, the modification in the Washington Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.531" offset="2578077">It declined and imposed a condition requiring United to take over the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.256" offset="2600960">Its decision and the reasons for it one's certain, the Brotherhood sought clarification, time was running out under the statute to do anything about this in a way to a petition to Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.538" offset="2650070">So, the Brotherhood petitioned the Court of Appeals with the District of Columbia Circuit, to review the Board's order on this another point.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.159" offset="2696568">At that juncture, the Board came in and said that we did not ask on the question of whether or not the United has required as a matter of law to take over this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.707" offset="2754769">We have left that to -- in substance, it said, we've left that litigation between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.371" offset="2781414">This being the case, the Brotherhood ultimately withdrew its petition from the Court of Appeals because it could not obtain a decision on this question by pursuing that petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.391" offset="2837525">The next step the Brotherhood took was --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="711.341" offset="2845362">But now why -- couldn't it have obtained in the Court of Appeals the decision as to whether or not the Civil Aeronautics Board should have passed on your issue?</text>

            <text syncTime="722.768" offset="2891024">No, because under the statute Your Honor, once the Board had come in and said, “Well, all we did was we exercised our discretion and substance not to impose this condition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="734.496" offset="2937940">Since the statute is very clear and it does merely authorize that the Board to impose within the terms and conditions, all the Brotherhood have been arguing in the Court of Appeals was the exercise of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.694" offset="2990707">It wouldn't have been arguing the basic question.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.650" offset="3102511">I'm reading very brief of the sentence, it said, “Neither did it purport to pass on the issue of whether United would be justified as a matter of contract or labor law and ignoring the agreement.”</text>

            <text syncTime="934.522" offset="3738018">The -- otherwise, that you would have to say that they had an absolute obligation under the statute to settle this and I don't know any provision of the statute on which you could base that absolute obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.763" offset="3815027">Following this, the Brotherhood didn't seek to file grievances with United.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.575" offset="3846269">These were -- the United just refused to accept them physically that is, in just a matter of processing that -- physically return them.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.518" offset="3882005">Brotherhood then went before the National Mediation Board because the agreement had been made in mediation before that Board under Section 5(2) of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.477" offset="3929861">That Board, in that case, United came in and said that the Mediation Board had no authority to pass on the question over the survivability of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.850" offset="3975314">The Mediation Board agreed with them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.554" offset="4058175">So, in that situation, the Brotherhood filed a suit in the Federal District Court at Cincinnati, Southern District of Ohio, to enforce the collective bargaining agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.073" offset="4272274">No I don't -- I don't believe -- I don't believe, that's right, because the jurisdiction of the Civil Aeronautics Board and the power of the Civil Aeronautics Board and what the Civil Aeronautics Board has to do is laid down in the Federal Aviation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.010" offset="4359941">And the -- it may be, -- Your Honor may -- if Your Honor may have in mind that there is a provision in the Federal Aviation Act with respect to the -- if a carrier certificate can be revoked if it fails to comply with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, what the jurisdiction of the Civil Aeronautics Board under this is not absolute either, this is a discretionary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.454" offset="4509780">It has -- it has been utilized on one or two occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.969" offset="4527856">But, its jurisdiction flows out of the Federal Aviation Act and also I may say at this point, Your Honor that United had previously claimed to the Board that this wasn't a question for resolution under the Federal Aviation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.043" offset="4580101">In fact, United's basic position all the way through is this isn't the right question for resolution by anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.200" offset="4608731">And coming back to the basis of our jurisdiction, we say that it was a violation of Section 240 of the Railway Labor Act which prohibits a carrier from changing the terms and conditions and the rates of pay and the working conditions of employees embodied an agreement except in accordance of provisions of Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.804" offset="4699115">Section 6, which sets up certain specific procedures by which the carriers have to change those provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.046" offset="4736104">We also relied on Section 1337 of Title 28 which gives federal courts jurisdiction over matters arising under statutes affecting commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.072" offset="4780199">As an alternative jurisdiction, we asserted jurisdiction under Title 28, 1332 under diversity of citizenship because the Brotherhood which located in Cincinnati, Ohio and United was a Delaware corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.481" offset="4845923">We asked for a declaratory injunction declaring the rights of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.108" offset="4864418">We also asked that United be enjoined from violating the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.014" offset="4888033">Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals held that the federal courts did not have any jurisdiction not on -- because none of these provisions that I have been reciting were applicable or not because the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.846" offset="4951353">United was not even asserting that point then, but because they said this involved the representation dispute over which the National Mediation Board had exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.953" offset="4999732">Now, the decisions of neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals say who the parties to this representation dispute are or what it's about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.725" offset="5034841">But United's brief says that what it has is that there were 2700 employees on Capital covered by this collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.398" offset="5073502">After the merger, 2170 of them became United employees and were unrepresented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.716" offset="5098789">530 of them belong to a group known as a Ramp and Stores employees, and these are employees are represented on United Airlines by the International Association of Machinists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.520" offset="5154064">So, on June 23rd, 1961, United entered into a separate agreement the Machinist by which these employees were integrated into the Machinist group and under Machinist contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.714" offset="5210802">And United says that enforcement of this Brotherhood contract necessarily raises a dispute as to where the representatives of these 530 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.105" offset="5264405">Well, this is not so unless the Brotherhood has specifically asked that this contract be declared invalid and it hasn't asked anybody to declare this contract invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.662" offset="5302648">The Brotherhood recognizes that where you have a collective bargaining representative on a property of another carrier that its agreement covering some of these people can be terminated in accordance with the procedures of the Railway Labor Act by the carrier and by that other collective bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.725" offset="5406824">But this doesn't affect the other 2170 employees who are unrepresented and who had rights under this collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.161" offset="5440575">And moreover, even as to the 530, their rights under the collective bargaining agreement didn't come to an end until it was terminated in accordance with the procedures of the Railway Labor Act by action between the IAM and United.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.095" offset="5492297">In other words, the -- it's quite clear that the duty of United was to take over and apply this contract even to these 530 until such time as they entered into this new agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.494" offset="5561887">United also makes reference to the fact that in 1962, the Brotherhood applied to represent the entire craft or class on United.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.794" offset="5603161">In other words, the whole craft or class involves about 12,000 people and the 2700 were covered by this contract for a minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.064" offset="5640255">So United says that this is evidence of a dispute with the -- between the Brotherhood and the IAM.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.133" offset="5668467">Well, the -- I think the United States very correctly entirely points out that this looks to the future, its respect to future representations has absolutely nothing to do with rights under the existing contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.685" offset="5734713">United also suggests that even if the Court of Appeals were wrong on the representation issue, it was right on the jurisdictional matter because the Brotherhood is a minority representative on the property of United and we would have thought that this question was disposed off by your decision in John Wiley and Sons in which these question was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.459" offset="5821753">United, as I understand, it says Wiley and Sons on this point isn't applicable because there was a suit brought under Section 301 of the Labor Management Act which permit suits by minority representatives whereas, under the Railway Labor Act, it contemplates representational made by majority representatives in Wiley carrier can voluntarily treat but in minority representative, it can't be required to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.372" offset="5925407">Well, what United is comparing here is a suit to enforce an existing agreement with the question of what rights are if you try to go and bargain for a brand new agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.339" offset="5977339">This Court pointed out in John Wiley and Sons case that the Union on the non-surviving company was not seeking any right except rights based on an existing agreement and that's the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.572" offset="6026240">The Brotherhood is not seeking any rights other than those based on existing agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.086" offset="6052258">We believe that the decision in International Association of Machinists v. Central Airlines in which this Court held that a Railway Labor Act agreement was enforceable under federal law as applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.174" offset="6120594">United says that well the IAM in that case was a majority representative and we see no basis to restrict the IAM -- to restrict that case to simply a majority representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.133" offset="6188513">Now, United also takes a different attack than the jurisdiction and it argues strongly in its brief that in any event, the complaint should have been dismissed because as a matter of law, it says the contract did terminate when the merger took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.313" offset="6273149">Now, it recognized that the Wiley case but it claims this is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.423" offset="6293629">It says the basic difference is that this contract was entered into between carriers that are subject to the Civil Aeronautics Act, that the Board approved this, that the Board imposed employee protective conditions and these employee protective conditions met the needs of National Labor Policy which were the underlying basis of the Wiley decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.080" offset="6388297">In the first place, the Board itself didn't say this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1645.597" offset="6582335">So, I think it's pretty difficult to say that the Board's conditions have greater impact or greater power than those imposed by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.434" offset="6621727">It's also directly contrary to all the practice in the railroad and airline industry by which although employee conditions have been imposed over a period of great many years, the parties still take over the collective bargaining agreements and they work these matters up under the collective bargaining agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1708.572" offset="6834260">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.181" offset="6836663">Unless it didn't terminate on the date of the merger, it is -- as a result of the merger it is in effect today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.175" offset="6864666">United also suggests that the merger here is different in kind and quality and magnitude from the John Wiley merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.189" offset="6904686">Well, I don't think you can decide these questions on the size of the carriers or the size of the companies and that sort of a principle what United's argument really comes down to is they say, “Well, it would be more difficult to work this out in this kind of a situation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.945" offset="6971768">Well, this agreement contemplated that very problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.531" offset="6982113">This Court in the Wiley case recognized that problem but said that this wasn't an insurmountable obstacle to enforcing the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.816" offset="7011161">And in this particular situation, Article 1(b) of the collective bargaining agreement contemplated that there might be problems and contemplated that the parties should get together and work them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.797" offset="7055151">That was the purpose of the provision that they have get together and decide on the procedure and the protection to the current employees and this was consistent with 30 years of practice under the railroad industry and the airline industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.311" offset="7113143">So I don't believe that United can argue on this basis that the contract didn't survive the merger.</text>

            <text syncTime="1806.454" offset="7225783">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.128" offset="7240411">The Government's interest in this case is chiefly through the National Mediation Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.982" offset="7263922">The agency which was held we think wrongly, by the courts below to have exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.673" offset="7294642">The Mediation Board also has a general concern with labor relations in the airlines industry and of course, a general concern with the interpretation and the administration of the Railway Labor Act which applies to the airlines as well as the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.101" offset="7364336">Our position here is that the District Court did have jurisdiction to declare United's obligation to submit to an adjustment board which is created by this contract any claims that United was violating the rights of the employees under the Clerk's Agreement with the Capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.635" offset="7454511">But that the District Court is obliged to stay at hand in passing and not pass on the substance of any of those claims in favor of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Adjustment Board created by the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.329" offset="7513234">To be a little more precise, we agree with the Clerks that the courts below were wrong in holding that this was a representation dispute and therefore, not justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.431" offset="7569659">We also agree with the Clerks essentially, I think, on the proposition that the Wiley case establishes the obligation of the -- of United, the acquiring corporation to submit disputes arising under the contract with the acquired cooperation to arbitration, which is essentially the same here as submitting them to an adjustment board because there's no real difference with this case between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.857" offset="7683344">On the other hand, we part company with the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.695" offset="7698704">I'm not sure that we get in company with the United but we part company with petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.221" offset="7720856">In thinking that they -- the District Court should not grant any further relief than that because we think the questions that arise concerning the substantive rights of the employees under this contract are questions within the primary jurisdiction of the Adjustment Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="2096.056" offset="8384157">The question of jurisdiction here obviously turns upon what is in issue, what is drawn in issue by the complaint in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.875" offset="8435461">There's no arguing of the fact that there is in the picture, the Labor Relations picture of United Airlines and its relations with these unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.572" offset="8482273">There are a number of questions of representations of the clerk's claim to be the exclusive bargaining representative and that's disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.018" offset="8519993">There are disputes concerning the particular crafts or classes that are appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.835" offset="8547265">There is a possibility that the Clerks of Machinists are claiming overlapping jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.052" offset="8572134">All those questions undoubtedly exist and some of them are before this Court, in cases in which the writ was granted two weeks ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.318" offset="8609228">But none of those issues as I read the complaint are involved in the present case, which is concerned exclusively with rights under a collective bargaining agreement and rights unaffected by any question of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.480" offset="8681848">The heart of the present case if I read the complaint right, is in paragraph 18 of the complaint, on page 8 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.685" offset="8722704">After referring to the merger, the complaint then says that carrier, meaning United, has refused to apply the terms of such agreement to any of these employees or to recognize any of the rights of any of these employees there under.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.749" offset="8790936">Then it lists things like seniority, basis of pay, handling of grievances, dscipline and the rest, as the kind of rights involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.430" offset="8829701">And then each subsequent paragraph of the complaint goes on and complains of United's refusal to apply the provisions of the agreement to any of the employees of Capital, for four or five paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.122" offset="8888424">Then over in paragraph 23, it refers specifically to the refusal to accept to process grievances in accordance with the procedures that I mentioned earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.294" offset="8949133">The complaint certainly does not expressly raise any questions of representation nor does the relief directly as requested invite any declaration or determination with respect to any question of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.823" offset="9023216">There's no claim made by the Brotherhood here that it is today the exclusive representative of any employees as I understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.103" offset="9056340">There's no claim made here of the right to be the representative in the future as I read the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.854" offset="9083402">Nor does it seem to me that this case indirectly turns upon any question of representation, or at least any relied question of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.570" offset="9130214">Certainly, there's no challenge to the fact that the Clerks were the representative at the time this contract was executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.862" offset="9163442">Well, that's admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.101" offset="9168353">If that were drawn in question, that'd be another case, but it couldn't be drawn in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.884" offset="9183504">They had a certification at the time and the contract itself recites that they were then the representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.886" offset="9211507">The status of the contract today does not, as I understand it, depend in anyway upon whether the Clerks, is today, the majority representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.103" offset="9260408">Under the Railway Labor Act, it has been the recognized view of everyone concerned for 30 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.589" offset="9290292">As Mr. Highsaw points out in his reply brief, that even a change in the identity of the representative does not automatically terminate the collective bargaining agreement or the question that's often debated about what effect in NLRB certification has on the existing agreement, doesn't arise under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.858" offset="9383393">There's a different -- different problem here, because in the railway industry as a result of statutes, of contract continue indefinitely until they are terminated under the terms of the statute or I suppose otherwise by operation of law, but they're not for a fix terms and then they may automatically lose their course.</text>

            <text syncTime="2945.753" offset="11783001">They also say even if we're wrong as to 530, we are right as to the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.463" offset="11809750">Now, taking what I've said thus far as predicate, I turn more precisely to the question of jurisdiction, the legal problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.553" offset="11858129">First, it seems to me that federal jurisdiction here is squarely positive upon 28 U.S.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.336" offset="11885296">Section 1331, an action arising under the laws of the United States where the jurisdictional amount is satisfied and upon 28 U.S.C. 1337, where no jurisdictional amount is required an action arising under a law regulating commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.470" offset="11961783">Insofar as I can see, both those points are squarely adjudicated by International Association of Machinists against Central Airlines in 372 U.S.682.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.835" offset="12023327">Now, United says that that case is distinguishable because in the present instance the -- excuse me -- because in the present instance, the Clerks may not have a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.248" offset="12084976">And they say that the Railway Labor Act affects the contract only if the Clerks are designated by a majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.413" offset="12125623">But of course the relevant section of the Railway Labor Act, Section 180 -- Section 204, printed on pages 19 and 20 of my brief, does not speak in terms of present majority status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.111" offset="12188421">It speaks in terms of the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.029" offset="12196049">It says it should be the duty of every carrier and of its employees acting through their representative, selected in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 and so on of this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.415" offset="12245577">The union was so selective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.131" offset="12252473">It didn't have that status at the time the contract was negotiated, and that's all that the statute requires it doesn't say about continuing the majority status or continuing the selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.057" offset="12320183">Coming now to the reasoning of the court below, it seems to me that it follows from what I've already said that this cannot be said to be a nonjusticiable dispute over representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.422" offset="12377652">Certainly, the Mediation Board has no power to resolve this controversy concerning the rights of employees or the Union to arbitrate or any other substantive rights under this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.653" offset="12442540">Its sole power is to determine afar the future through election machinery who will be the representatives to negotiate contracts in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.766" offset="12494994">It has no practical power or legal power with respect to the contract and its status during the intervening period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.410" offset="12533551">The same considerations, I think, show that this is not a case such as so illustrated by some other cases in this Court, where the question -- where the case involves a question of representation and there is nobody with power to adjudicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.694" offset="12606694">The three cases relied on by the courts below are -- I submit quite plainly distinguishable of the Switchmen's Union case in 321 U.S., was a case in which one union, the BRT, sought to be certified for unit made up of all yardmen allover the New York Central System.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.227" offset="12696869">The Switchmen's Union sought to be certified for a unit -- a lesser included unit, made up of the yardmen in some of yards of the New York Central System.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.915" offset="12743576">Clearly, the end of the controversy was who would be certified, the intermediate stage of the controversy would be what would be the applicable craft or class and both of those are questions you could find in the National Mediation Board, but something quite different from the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.299" offset="12821107">The general committee against the Katy Railroad in 320 U.S. decided the same day, did involve a dispute which I guess no one had power to adjudicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.004" offset="12847961">There, the issue was which of two unions, the engineers or firemen, had authority to negotiate rules concerning the assignment of fireman to the job of engineer when the engineer who held that job failed to show up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.788" offset="12947122">There were -- one contract was negotiated by the engineers then the firemen's union negotiated another contract and then the engineers brought suit for a declaration that the firemen had exceeded their statutory authority in negotiating their contract on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.045" offset="13028101">At the Court's opinions in this case as well as the briefs, makes it very clear that the whole issue was in terms of the statutory authority of the firemen to negotiate that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.975" offset="13079824">The case would be conferrable to this, I think, if there were any challenge to the authority of the Clerks who had negotiated this contract at the time they negotiated, because there is no such challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.453" offset="13129770">The point that their authority at that time is admitted, it's not in issue, and the case is therefore distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.036" offset="13164042">It seems to us, therefore, that the considerations I have mentioned do require reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals and the next question becomes should this Court then send the matter back to have all the remaining questions considered in the courts below or should some of the other questions that have been argued here, be decided here in view of the protracted character of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.728" offset="13278877">And it seems to us that it would be appropriate and though it's obviously not essential for this Court to decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.228" offset="13308865">There are two principles, I think, the Court should make plain in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.798" offset="13331122">One is that the obligation to submit the dispute to the Adjustment Board that survives the merger, on that point, it seems to us that the Wiley case is plainly controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.178" offset="13396637">The only attempted distinction which has I think even the color of merit is the argument that the Civil Aeronautics Board by providing this protective conditions occupied the field as it were and excluded the continued operation of the contract or excluded the operation of the policy at considerations that led to the Wiley decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.355" offset="13509381">But I think the answer to that really is that the predictive conditions were not intended to and do not occupy the same field that this collective bargaining agreement occupied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.176" offset="13564656">If you look at the conditions in Section 1 on page 59 of the record, it says that the -- it is the intent that such conditions are to be restricted to those changes in employment, solely due to and resulting from such merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.153" offset="13632575">Fluctuations rises and falls of changes in volume of character of employment brought about solely by other causes are not covered by or intended to be covered by this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.100" offset="13676356">There are many rights given by this contract, which wholly apart and unrelated to things that might happen from the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.864" offset="13715435">To take the simplest case of all, the claim that discipline or discharge is unjust because the employee didn't do what he was alleged to do or because that is a just cause for this charge, or take a controversy over seniority, bidding for jobs at some point that only Capital served and to which no new employees have been transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.464" offset="13809789">One can think of any number of things which would protect employees under this agreement, that the protective conditions being concerned with the displacement of employees and loss of jobs would have nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.998" offset="13867990">Now, we do think -- again, really following the analogy of the Wiley case that the substantive rights under this contract are rights which are for the Adjustment Board to determine when a specific case is processed under the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.760" offset="13955030">There are two lines of authority that seem to us to support that view, one is the Delaware, Lackawanna against Slocum and that line of cases holding that the courts may not act in a matter over which they Railway Adjustment Boards have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.976" offset="14019814">And the second is exemplified by a case TWA against Koppal and 345 U.S. 653, holding that it was Missouri law and I think this Court would adopt the same view, that where an arbitration clause was available in a contract then the employee must resort to that machinery before he may bring suit in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.402" offset="14129528">The Brotherhood in its reply brief attempts to deal with these points to the number of ways and it's easiest to take each of the up seriatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.104" offset="14184385">They say, first, that the decision in Wiley and Sons does not preclude broader relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.861" offset="14215419">Well that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.451" offset="14221793">It's the Slocum case and TWA against Koppal in that line of case that precludes broader relief and Wiley case certainly doesn't entitle them to broader relief because all it held was that the dispute might go to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.591" offset="14286263">Then they say that the merger contract provided that United would assume all the debts and liabilities of Capital, and that Delaware law required United to assume the obligations of the Brotherhood-Capital agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.531" offset="14346031">There are three answers I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.715" offset="14354808">First, I doubt whether there would be any federal jurisdiction in this case either to enforce the merger contract or to enforce the Delaware law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.855" offset="14399321">Second, whatever obligation the merger contract imposes or the Delaware statute imposes, it was at most an obligation to comply with the Clerks-Capital agreement which provides for its enforcement through the Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.972" offset="14475807">You can't get away from the Adjustment Board by saying that there is an obligation to comply with that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.249" offset="14504960">I see that my time has expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.748" offset="14514991">I'll leave the rest in my brief.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart Bernstein</label>
            <text syncTime="3641.225" offset="14564833">This case was tried in the District Court by cross motions for summary judgments supported affidavits of both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.823" offset="14599210">The complaint -- the naked complaint, I would concede clearly appears to state a simple contract claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.162" offset="14628571">The affidavits, however, set out some of the background of the situation and some of the relationships of the parties here, analyze to this that the Court addressed itself in deciding that there was no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.583" offset="14686250">Mr. Highsaw has stated the facts and he and I just simply don't see them the same way and I like to review them rather quickly, if I may, to put this case in its perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.423" offset="14729613">The Capital-United merger was unique and if you ascribe some uniqueness to the result of this contract, I think it arises out of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.375" offset="14765453">The examiner found that this was the first time in the history of the industry that a major carrier faced foreclosure of a creditor's land, this was the Vickers which held the paper on the Vicon aircraft and was about to foreclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.736" offset="14818847">The Court of Appeals which ultimately reviewed the merger found that it was an emergency crash measure that Capital wasn't extremist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.668" offset="14846642">And it was -- in this posture, that the merger agreement was entered into and the matter was brought before the Civil Aeronautics Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.108" offset="14876421">Now, one of the things that the Board was most concerned with and you find references throughout the decision of the examiner and of the Board, was what would happen the employees of Capital in either event if the merger would be approved or if the merger were to be denied because the Civil Aeronautics Board under at Section 408 of the Federal Aviation Act has authority to approve mergers if it finds them in the public interest and on such terms and conditions as it finds just unreasonable and it is under this clause that the labor protective provisions discussed by Mr. Cox are imposed by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.748" offset="15014975">Now, the Board found the CAB, I better refer to them this, we know which board we're talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.070" offset="15036186">The CAB found that if the merger were not improved, Capital would go out of business and the 7600 employees would lose their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.025" offset="15068056">However, if the merger were improved, not only would their employment continue since United had made an undertaking that all employees other than officers of Capital would become employees of United.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.714" offset="15114762">But that in addition, their terms and conditions of employment at United would be equal or superior to those that they enjoyed at Capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.480" offset="15149871">And at the same time, the Board found that the merger would be in the public interest because the deficit of about $1,700,000 which Capital had in 1959, the year of preceding the merger hearing, that the savings which would result from the consolidation of facilities and employees at the 12 common points served by the two carriers would be more than enough to wipe out their deficit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.237" offset="15240882">That is the saving was estimated about $1,900,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.146" offset="15256555">Now, all of these was before the Board, all these was considered and United's position that it could improve the conditions of employment was predicated on its position that this employees would come under United's collective bargaining agreements or United's terms and conditions of employment unilaterally imposed for its employees were not organized and these were in almost areas in superior to those of Capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.269" offset="15349029">So for example, the examiner found that the pensions would improve, that there would be an average increase for 50% of the Capital employees of $225 a year in their wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.635" offset="15394482">But their insurance benefits, health and accident benefits, dependency coverage, all these would improve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.267" offset="15412976">Our affidavits additionally showed that the vacation benefits would be improved, that matters of this kind would all be superior at the United rather than at Capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.993" offset="15447876">Now, when we put this before the courts before, our position wasn't -- we did this in an off-handed matters in this although perhaps of no legal significance nonetheless this is the case, I suppose we were trying to impress the Court with the equity of the situation that nobody was really being hurt by this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.589" offset="15510256">But I think the Wiley case has placed this in a different posture and this now does become a matter of legal significance so if this Court was obviously concerned with the impact of an unregulated merger on the interest of employees and since this is a regulated merger and the impact was otherwise, I think it now assume some legal significance, and I don't think I'm quite as diffident about this point as I was in earlier stages of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.038" offset="15604088">While the Brotherhood intervened in this proceeding before the CAB and it said, “We ask you to impose on United as a condition of the merger our collective bargaining agreement which we had with Capital.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.243" offset="15652885">And they said, “The reason we're doing this,” this is in the examiner's report, “is because the merger agreement makes no provision for its continuation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.220" offset="15684859">Now, we argue this, the Brotherhood's position was twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.660" offset="15694576">One, that as a matter of law it survived and two, in any event, it should be imposed as a condition under the 408 authority of the Board, composed just and reasonable conditions, we defended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.780" offset="15739089">We said, “It does not survive as a matter of law and in any event, it would be an onerous condition to impose on us to require us to have duplicate and conflicting working conditions for employees working side by side.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.155" offset="15784542">Now, the argument is made that this is the first time of 30 years that the collective bargaining agreements were not assumed by the surviving carrier and mergers under the Railway Labor Act under the -- yes, be the railroads or airlines under the Railroad Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.304" offset="15837205">I pointed out that this was a unique merger the, first one of its kind where it was done so to speak under the shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.361" offset="15861342">And it was necessary if United was to realize the savings of $1,900,000 to immediately functionally integrate Capital into United system so that overnight, the night of the merger took place on June 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.391" offset="15913482">On May 31st, I was in a hotel in Detroit and on the evening of May 31st, they took it off across the streets at Capital and the next morning it's says United and on June 1st, the airplane said United and not Capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.910" offset="15963638">The disappearance of Capital was immediate and complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.411" offset="15977639">It have to be else, United could not have possibly gone into this merger under these conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.470" offset="16001776">Now Mr. Highsaw says, when the Board really didn't pass on it because counsel made statement at the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.000" offset="16027899">But what happened was the Board said about this contract, this is a matter which ought to arise under the labor protective provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.531" offset="16058096">One of the provisions was that if there was going to be any rearrangement of employees as a result of the merger, the carrier should give notice to that affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.392" offset="16093518">And it said, “You should give notice under that provision which is Section 11 of the labor protective provisions to all employees who will be affected by the laws of representation and collective bargaining agreement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.047" offset="16140121">Now, that didn't mean that if United was to give that notice, that contract didn't collapse at that point and I simply don't know what the Board was saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.644" offset="16174498">Well, we went ahead and gave such notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.800" offset="16183171">This is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.120" offset="16188395">And immediately, the Brotherhood went back to the Board and its brief -- the petition for reconsideration and said, “United put this notice up, we're going to lose our contract and we want you to reconsider what you did.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.257" offset="16228937">And the Board turned down that petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4059.444" offset="16237714">At that point, the Brotherhood petitioned the Court of Appeals to review and they raise the same questions about the surviving -- the survival of this contract, the same points that were raised in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.501" offset="16277943">As a matter of fact the affidavit that they filed in support of their motion for a stay, when it relates to the contract benefits was the employees are alleged to have lost by virtue of United's refusal to take over this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.846" offset="16323291">Those provisions are verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.786" offset="16331128">The same in the affidavits filed in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the District Court in this case in one of the affidavits in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.033" offset="16364042">They make this sa -- same allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.553" offset="16374178">This was all before the Court of Appeals and a motion for a stay was argued a few days before the merger was to become effective, these very points were briefed and argued and the Court of Appeals denied the stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.130" offset="16416496">Well then -- then the Brotherhood went back to the CAB to recons -- to -- for an -- and asked the CAB to stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.057" offset="16440216">And they said, “The reason we want you to do this among others is that we were told in Court by counsel for the CAB that you didn't purport to pass on the question of whether this survived as a matter of law or contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.149" offset="16484519">Now, Mr. Highsaw said and that what the counsel said, was that the matters should be left to private litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.377" offset="16517433">I think he must spoke himself, what counsel said was, it should be left to private argument, private argument before the Court of Appeals at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4136.800" offset="16547109">And it was argued by Mr. Highsaw and by myself before the Court of Appeals about on -- I think on May 23rd, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.698" offset="16578769">He did not say to private litigation but private argument and it was so argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.591" offset="16598309">Well then, the hearing schedule was setup, a briefing schedule was setup in the Court of Appeals and Brotherhood did not file its brief and finally after motions to delay on November 6th, November 6th, withdrew its petition for a review from the Court of Appeals and three days later, started this action, alleging that the contract was not assumed by United and did not survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.376" offset="16693499">Now, I want to stop at this point if you please Your Honors, to point out that at this juncture, I think that the institution at this suit was an interference with the whole scheme under the Federal Aviation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.077" offset="16752222">And I wish to cite a case out of my embarrassment, not cited in our brief to this Court, Pan American and World Airways versus United States, 371 U.S. 296, which raises many analogies to the case we have here and in that case, the Court before jurisdiction to the CAB even though the CAB did not have any proceeding brought before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.974" offset="16831843">And there, the CAB had asked the Attorney General to institute an antitrust suit under the Sherman Act against Pan Am, Panagra and Grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.319" offset="16869251">It was under three counts of the Sher -- three points of the Sherman Act that had to do with the carving up of the markets in South America that have routes between the East Coast of the United States and the West Coast of South America and somewhere else between Central America and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4230.556" offset="16922122">The District Court dismissed as to Panagra and Grace but found that Pan American was guilty of an antitrust violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.628" offset="16962456">It was civil action not guilty but found that there was proper basis for the antitrust action against Pan American.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.469" offset="16993802">The case that came up to this Court directly, and this Court held that the CAB under its authority under Section 411 of the Federal Aviation Act, should take control of this matter because it was so intimately related to federally -- to freight regulation of air transport and that the Court should not intrude, and they said otherwise would have two agencies looking at these matters and it ought to be left to the CAB.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.829" offset="17095262">Well that was so here and certainly more so in this situation, where it was before the CAB, there is no question with the CAB, would have authority to either impose the contract or to say the contract would not have survived, as a matter of fact this is precisely what the CAB did in a -- an earlier merger involving Pan American and American Overseas Airways, in Kent versus CAB.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.693" offset="17186691">There, the two groups of flight engineers or the two companies couldn't agree on their seniority, how to merge that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.862" offset="17211350">The Board took jurisdiction again and applied seniority in a strict basis of length of service.</text>

            <text syncTime="4513.512" offset="18053956">Well, if Your Honor please, this is the difficulty with the -- perhaps stating the facts, so the piecemeal of the fact was that these employees became -- this union became a minority union, a unit for only a minority of the craft or class.</text>
            <text syncTime="4526.290" offset="18105156">Now this was part of the fact before -- brought before the District Court and that indicated that under the Railway Labor Act, this union could not maintain this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4535.701" offset="18142772">This requires my discussion of the other basis for our attack on jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4539.323" offset="18157192">We actually based it on three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.941" offset="18163670">One was that they were not justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.025" offset="18172029">Second, that in any event, there was no federal jurisdiction because of the 301 difference under the National Labor Relations Act and third, because of the position of the CAB.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.288" offset="18209123">Now the CAB, I not only concede but I assert could have imposed this essay condition of the merger or it could have said it will not be effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4562.171" offset="18248620">But it was a different kind of dispute when brought in the Court in view of the fact that there was this overriding representation problem arising out of its minority status in the conflict of jurisdiction with the International Association of Machinists.</text>
            <text syncTime="4574.407" offset="18297626">This couldn't be -- couldn't be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="4576.937" offset="18307657">Now, if the CAB had acted and had said, you must assume this contract, we would have been free, not to go ahead with the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4585.393" offset="18341512">This is one of the choices available to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.690" offset="18362723">I would -- now, I could shift to the other basis of the 301, 204 jurisdictional argument if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="4599.294" offset="18397100">In the Wiley case that was held, that the fact that the Wiley union became a minority representative after the merger, did not foreclose it from bringing an action to enforcing arbitration provisions of the contract and it based it on an interpretation of Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act and there simply is no comparable provision under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.201" offset="18492709">Now, the difficulty is that prior to the enactment of Section 301, it was virtually impossible for a national labor organization to maintain a federal action or to be sued in a federal court because its jurisdiction for diversity purposes would depend on the citizenship of each of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.685" offset="18566687">And since any national union has members in virtually every state, it was -- it would be almost impossible to ever find a diversity suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4649.094" offset="18596362">And so 301 was amended, was added up to the statute, in order to enable contracts to be brought under the National Labor Relations Act against unions and also allow unions to maintain suits, and that was what led to the various kinds of litigation before this Court on the various arbitration cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.719" offset="18662818">But Section 20 -- but in Wiley, it was said that the fact that the Union lost its majority status, did not mean that it could not maintain a 301 action and it's cited Retail Clerks versus Lion Dry Goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.472" offset="18721855">And in that case, what the Court said was that 301 refers to representatives of employees, it does not say majority representatives, because if -- the Court said if it intended that, it would have referred to the Section 1(a), which is the means of providing for majority representatives under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.793" offset="18791131">But Section 204, on which jurisdiction has asserted here by the United States, states that it will be that system boards will be established by representatives of employees designated in accordance with the provisions of this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.130" offset="18852467">And the only way you can designate a representative is through a bargaining elect -- representation election by which a majority representative is selected for the entire craft or class.</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.648" offset="18894576">Now, after the merger, this union lost its status as the representative for the entire craft or class, it makes no claim that it represents the entire craft or class at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.549" offset="18938149">It only represents those employees who are formally employed by Capital, that's the sole basis for its assertion at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4741.777" offset="18967092">Now to say that, because it was originally designated as a majority representative, that status therefore continues -- creates some other statutory problems because Section 211 which contains comparable language and says that employees selected in accordance with the provisions of this Act may enter into agreements requiring employees to become members of labor organizations would also carry over here because here, we had a union security agreement which was negotiated in Capital and would carry over to United, would we say that because this union security agreement was originally entered into it at that time that the Brotherhood was the majority representative that therefore, it will continue at United.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.259" offset="19124976">Would this mean that new employees hired at United for example who were in the Clerk of craft or class, would be required to join Brotherhood?</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.516" offset="19154024">Or would it mean that the 530 or the 2700 employees who formally worked at Capital, must continue to maintain their membership?</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.806" offset="19187148">Now, when we posed these problems in our brief, we got two different answers from the Brotherhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.525" offset="19214002">When we said that you have showed no way in which an employee could have been hurt here because of the improved working conditions, so what is your complaint?</text>
            <text syncTime="4812.656" offset="19250573">Their response was, “Well, we have rights too, we as the Union, there is a union security clause here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4818.329" offset="19273247">We have a right under that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.538" offset="19282129">But then what we said to them, “He would certainly wouldn't suggest that we arbitrate whether or not you would require employees to continue to maintain their membership in the Brotherhood after the merger, or that new employees would become members of the Brotherhood.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4832.417" offset="19329567">Their response is, “We are not talking about membership but we're talking about employee rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4837.640" offset="19350465">You see you would get a shifting argument here when you focus in on the fact that nobody has been hurt, the answer is, “Well, maybe the Union has been hurt.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.993" offset="19379931">But when you say, but the Union certainly can't assert that it can force employees to join the Union after the merger, when it no longer is the majority collective bargaining representative says, “Well, we're not talking about that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4856.262" offset="19424967">We're talking about the employee contract rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.118" offset="19436460">And this is -- one of the anomalies of the case here is that usually when one is asserting that a collective bargaining agreement ought to survive, the usual situation is that the employees are better off forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.284" offset="19485048">They have gained something as a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="4873.328" offset="19493303">But the Congress is true here, because if in fact this contract were to be imposed on United, United could insist on reducing the vacations, insist on paying reduced wages and the thing just become an absolute anomaly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.403" offset="19545548">Now, this is the difficulty with the position as I see it that the Government is asserting here, they asked this Court to direct United to arbitrate these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.496" offset="19577940">But what is there to arbitrate, are you to give us a general direction to arbitrate anything that might come up in the future either say anything any contract provision is to be arbitrated or are we to talk about specific clients?</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.523" offset="19626005">A specific employee grievance that this happened to me on such a day and therefore, I want some relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.863" offset="19647425">But where is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="4913.494" offset="19653904">Where is that, it simply isn't in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.260" offset="19664980">Now there are general allegations that some grievances were filed and that we refused -- pardon?</text>

            <text syncTime="4980.223" offset="19920875">Now, is the Court to direct a general kind of arbitration of anything that the Union suggests, and this puts us into another position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4986.808" offset="19947207">Mr. Highsaw said the contract here did not expire and continues from year-to-year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4991.522" offset="19966015">If the contract is terminable on 30 days notice by its terms and has been since February of 1962, so that if United had acted out over an abundance of caution, I suppose it might have terminated the contract in February 1962 saying that we don't agree, we're bombed and in any event we're terminating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5009.986" offset="20039889">What this would mean is that if we were directed to arbitrate there would be nothing to prevent us from not giving 30 days notice to terminate this contract and then what are we left with?</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.187" offset="20068728">If no employee grievances have come up now, to this point, then what is to be arbitrated?</text>
            <text syncTime="5023.469" offset="20093806">What I am simply suggesting Mr. Justice White is I don't know how we can be directed to arbitrate issues which haven't been identified and this was a point made in the Wiley case incidentally when it was pointed out that a union could abandon its claim to arbitrate by not identifying them for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="5040.475" offset="20161829">Now here, not only has the claim has not been identified but as I say the only -- I think the only thing that I could think of in which an employee might have had a grievance was for discriminatory discharge or dismissal, arbitrary dismissal or something of that kind, because the ordinary working conditions are superior as I pointed out under the United arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5061.272" offset="20245002">But no such thing has happened and no such thing has been alleged, there is no claim of that kind in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.502" offset="20269976">When the Court directed that -- let's go back and see if there has been any kind of arbitrary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5071.457" offset="20285753">If you find some and if you want to arbitrate them, then arbitrate them.</text>

            <text syncTime="5164.570" offset="20658260">And I'm not going to be evasive about this but the fact of the matter was that if I win the 530 employees were placed under the machinist contract at United which conflicted with the Brotherhood contract, United did invite them -- the Brotherhood answers -- talk to them about the integration of the seniority of these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5183.299" offset="20733179">And they refuse to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.829" offset="20739239">It's a matter of record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5186.174" offset="20744673">And it's one thing that can draw possibilities, but this is what did happen in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5190.447" offset="20761704">And in fact what happened is that in November of 1960, Capital met with Brotherhood and said to it, “What do you propose as conditions to be applied after the merger?</text>
            <text syncTime="5200.847" offset="20803291">That is, what you think the protections ought to be?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5203.558" offset="20814158">And because Capital could not guarantee that United would go along with what was agreed on, the Brotherhood refused to say anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="5210.561" offset="20842162">Now, they convert this into a statement that Capital said, “United won't be bound by anything we agreed too,” but that is not what was said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5217.260" offset="20869016">What was said was, that we can't guarantee that and it may well be that if Cap -- if the Brotherhood come up with specific suggestions, these would have been completely acceptable, but they never did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5228.561" offset="20914155">I hesitate to scribe motivation here, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.140" offset="20924500">This is what drives me back to the fact and I think this really is ultimately a representation dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.200" offset="20944771">You get this pattern of coming up to the -- to the threshold and backing off.</text>
            <text syncTime="5241.507" offset="20965982">You meet with Capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="5242.923" offset="20971624">And Capital says, “Well what are your proposals?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5244.575" offset="20978207">Well you say that you can't guarantee that United will take them, so we won't tell you,” and then they back off.</text>
            <text syncTime="5249.752" offset="20999001">We get to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.915" offset="21003598">It looks like they're going to have to file a brief and get a decision on this thing and incidentally, there was a decision in the early 1962, get back off and start over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="5259.240" offset="21036931">But what is the reason for this procrastination, this expansion of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.250" offset="21056993">Then I would submit it's an order to assist the general organizing campaign that's going on to organizing the entire group of employees at United, the 13,000 of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.697" offset="21090743">And -- but for the litigation that Mr. Cox referred to which is now before this Court, which will be argued I think sometime in January, that election would have been held a long time ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.516" offset="21130031">And I would guess that once the election would have been held, then Brotherhood wouldn't have abandoned this action as it has a real action along the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.878" offset="21159497">It went to the Mediation Board two weeks after the District Court dismissed this complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="5307.076" offset="21228251">Because I think the stakes are rather high and bargaining group of 13,000 is considerably more significant than 2700.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.224" offset="21256882">Otherwise, I don't know how you can explain the conduct of getting this case before the Court of Appeals, for the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="5320.281" offset="21281123">And every issue that could have been raised in this proceeding in the District Court, and then just when you're going to get the briefing, you dismissed and three days later, start all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.674" offset="21318635">I can see nothing in it but delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.373" offset="21337443">I have nothing further, if the Court please, with respect to this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5337.831" offset="21351236">It seems to me that when we're all done with it, the employees are in the peculiar position of being better off before -- because they lost their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5345.188" offset="21380702">I will concede that there are many advantages to having a collective bargaining agreement on your behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="5351.914" offset="21407556">That's protection against arbitrary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.834" offset="21415288">It's a protection against many things but these didn't happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5356.916" offset="21427618">And I don't think we can direct arbitration here on the assumption that might have happened but they didn't happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5362.336" offset="21449247">The employees are far better off here because of the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="5364.848" offset="21459383">And if the contract is directed to be imposed on United as Brotherhood suggest, employees will suffer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.331" offset="21481221">For if we'd arbitrate, I don't know what were to arbitrate, because maybe we wouldn't want to arbitrate some of the reductions as well as some of the improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5377.274" offset="21509016">For that reason, I think that the general posture here Your Honor, is that there was no ultimate federal jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5386.133" offset="21544438">There was no -- not a justiciable issue because what is at the bottom here is a representation of dispute over the bargaining rights for 13,000 employees, all the United employees in this craft or class.</text>
            <text syncTime="5398.858" offset="21595429">I don't see how a craft or class for less on the entire group at a -- at an airline under the Railway Labor Act just we have set it out in our brief could claim any rights under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5410.907" offset="21643598">There's action of anything, if it was justiciable at all would have to be based on diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.766" offset="21663033">And there simply is no diverse up here -- diversity here despite the fact that it was alleged in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="5420.761" offset="21682991">Because this is a voluntary, unincorporated association and I'm certain that there are members you know in Delaware where United is incorporated, in Illinois where United has its principal place of business.</text>
