            <text syncTime="39.540" offset="158093">Mr. Chief Justice and Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.628" offset="182439">The issues involved in this case are indeed most significant in view of some of the decisions in this Court, more specifically Mapp versus Ohio and Ker versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.585" offset="246282">It is of course beyond dispute as has been said but that the Constitution does prohibit the use by state courts of evidence seized in violation of that instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.523" offset="294034">Further, Ker, further begets the idea that the standards to be used are those that have been developed under the Fourth Amendment in cases decided in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.424" offset="349623">In the situation involving Mr. Beck, the evidence is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.317" offset="373238">The police officers testified that they had the information from an unnamed and undisclosed informer that William Beck was engaged in the violation of the statute which prohibited a numbers operation, this statute having various ramifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.022" offset="448052">The officer testified that they had received this information in the morning and that they left the police station for the purpose of arresting William Beck on sight.</text>

            <text syncTime="135.234" offset="540839">There's no specific evidence in the record which supports that notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.146" offset="556513">However, it is a fact that William Beck lived in the vicinity where he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.908" offset="583576">And the information that the officer related and of course we did not go into that because of the Court's ruling which obviously was not going to permit us to bring this informer in to actually determine whether or not he even existed and we take the position that this situation as enunciated by the Supreme Court of Ohio in their opinion gives rise to the position that has been taken in our judgment by the police in Ohio that they can merely say they have information from confidential informers, and that we are precluded by the opinion in Beck versus Ohio to inquire as to whether or not he even in fact exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.734" offset="742922">Specifically in this case, the officer testified that when he saw William Beck riding along the street that he stopped him and in our judgment that at this point this constituted an arrest if the Court meant what it said in Henry, this Court meant what it said in the Henry case.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.555" offset="818155">They stopped William Beck and they searched him and at that time they did not find anything.</text>

            <label>Mr. James R. Willis</label>

            <text syncTime="272.327" offset="1089306">At least this is the interpretations that I would place on it because certainly they were not at that point looking for any weapons to secure themselves or to prevent him from escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.699" offset="1130789">I feel and it is my contention that they were looking for something to justify the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.132" offset="1152522">It is significant that the statute under which Mr. Beck was subsequently charged was enacted by the legislature of Ohio only by two months before the time that Mr. Beck was arrested and charged and this probably was one of the first cases that involved that statute, but significantly during the trial, the police officer was asked the name of this alleged informer.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.149" offset="1256594">And of course the Court ruled subsequently that this was irrelevant in view of the fact that this was an arrest, this was a search incident to an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.773" offset="1299017">And of course if we take the position asserted by the dissenting opinion in the Supreme Court of Ohio which I think is a correct expression of the law that this arrest must stand or fall on whether or not it was consistent with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.409" offset="1361607">And the law in Ohio is that you may arrest for a felony if you have reasonable grounds to believe that a felony has been committed or you can arrest for a misdemeanor if it's committed in your presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.235" offset="1404865">Now, it's significant here that Beck was charged with a misdemeanor and he was charged with simple possession of the items that had been found in his possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.455" offset="1445721">We think this is significant because the officer obviously did not know he had these items on his person at the time he made the arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1740.033" offset="6960065">Now, throughout the record it shows that all of these information, the officer testified under oath came to him from an informer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.536" offset="6998100">And I wish to make the point that there is no -- there was no inquiry as to what time he got this information because that would be important as to whether or not this officer on a special squad had time to go to a magistrate and attempt to get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.677" offset="7078661">Further in the record he says when he was asked why he didn't get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.521" offset="7094021">He says “I couldn't get a warrant on this kind of information.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.329" offset="7109277">Now we have to assume what he means, that is from information, from an informer who didn't -- he doesn't even say who was the informer, disclosed at that time who he was and whether he was dependable, but using the phrase that Mr. Justice Stewart used this morning about the facts of life, I would like to be permitted to comment on this particular crime and first I would like to bring the Court's attention to the word of this crime as in the Revised Code of Ohio which as counsel has told you became effective September 1st, 1961 approximately two months before this arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.748" offset="7298926">Now this is the Revised Code 2915.111.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.070" offset="7324212">"No person shall own, possess, have on or about this person, have in his custody, or have under his control a ticket, order, or device for or representing a number of shares or an interest in a scheme of chance known as policy,' numbers game,' clearing house,' or by words or terms of similar import, located in or to be drawn, paid, or carried on within or without this state.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.911" offset="7447615">Now, this is the penalty which determines whether or not it would be a misdemeanor or a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.183" offset="7472692">"Whoever violates this section shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars and imprisoned not more than six months for a first offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.828" offset="7519295">For each subsequent offense, such person shall be fined not less than five hundred nor more than one thousand dollars and imprisoned not less than one nor more than three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.817" offset="7595259">Now under the laws of Ohio, any penalty which is required to be imposed of more than a year makes it a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.845" offset="7639353">In this case as the record show William Beck was charged under Section 2915.111 and since this, on second offense caused for a felony conviction, then we should apply the rules as to what a police officer must do in order to make an arrest and an incidental search thereto when he is in his opinion convinced that a felony is being committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.824" offset="7807269">Now, the commission of this felony is having on your person in these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.097" offset="7832346">And whether or not this police officer, Sergeant Delajo knew it or not so long as this petition or any other person had about him concealed evidences of participating in this gambling game, the felony was being committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.018" offset="7920013">Now that must be borne in mind when we apply the test as to what the officer was required to do in affecting his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.555" offset="7958152">And in the record he says “I went out to look for this man and if I found him I intended to arrest him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.484" offset="7981871">He did find him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.367" offset="7985424">He found him at the time and place that he was informed he would be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.509" offset="8009979">Now he stopped his car, he asked him to pullover.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.688" offset="8026697">He pulled over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.409" offset="8029623">He searched the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.967" offset="8039863">Now there's nothing in the record saying that the evidence of gambling would be in the car or on the person who was driving the car or who was the passenger in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.549" offset="8090122">And so that's of course would have to remain for the officer to use his judgment and being on the special investigation squad and having much experience, he would take an approach perhaps different from anyone of us or certainly any lay person in his approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.928" offset="8159608">He searched the car, and then he says in the record, “I placed him under arrest while I was searching the car.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.690" offset="8194717">He found nothing in the car and that wasn't unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.455" offset="8213734">What would have been unusual is for these number slips to be lying out on the seat of the car?</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.304" offset="8237140">It would be expected that they would be on the person and so he placed him under arrest, took him to the Fifth District Station, on 117 Chester, and there searched the person as the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.609" offset="8298371">Now, I can imagine the hue and cry that would have gone up, if a police officer asked William Beck to step out on the street and he had started taking off his clothes to see if they had secreted about his person number slips that would have made the front page.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.501" offset="8361900">So we took him to a precinct station and there arrest -- searched him and found in his socks an envelope containing these slips.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.501" offset="8425953">Now here the significant in this case and I wish to call it to the Court's attention because just so recently, the Mapp case from our state had been reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.632" offset="8470465">That there is no evidence in the record that at any time William Beck was mistreated, that he resisted arrest, that he was manhandled, and the trial consisted solely of a stipulation suggested to and entered in by counsel for the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.404" offset="8573597">That the inquiry made to support his motion to suppress was all of the evidence that was available and it was stipulated that that evidence should be the evidence considered for the Court to determine the guilt or innocence of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.909" offset="8663562">Now, if there were any other facts of significance which counsel thought the Court should know or which he thought would aid his client in being acquitted, then certainly he had the opportunity to go forward because the trial judge asked “Are you ready to go forward gentlemen?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.380" offset="8753424">It was then that it was announced that this case would be submitted on stipulation of Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.854" offset="8779337">Now, that is significant because much of what surrounds this is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.785" offset="8815073">And so at this point I would like to have the liberty and again alluding to the factual situation, we're talking about the conduct of a gambling operation which is based on a number being determined everyday by the results of the number of shares of stocks sold on and agreed exchange, maybe it's the New York Stock Exchange or maybe another exchange which is known to the players.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.507" offset="8958015">The players have to place their number written on a piece of paper at a particular place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.568" offset="8990198">And then the next operation is that others come and collect these pieces of paper with some identification as to who the owner is and takes them to another place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.444" offset="9041711">And this operation has to be carried on in almost split -- split second time because it's all over in a few hours and each day is complete in itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.765" offset="9087060">And if the man who is in the pick up man, whose duty it is to collect these numbers and take them to the place where they're registered fails to get there on the minute, now remember there have been articles on the newspapers to the effect that some late players had contact with New York and they went away with the killing because the number had been announced before the numbers had been placed with the house that paid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.617" offset="9202416">Now all of that is most important in the consideration of the rights of this petitioner because it goes to the gravamen of this case as to whether or not this police officer acted in view of all the circumstances on information which came to him and the record doesn't say how long before one o'clock and he was told that he got there at one what he would find.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.816" offset="9303249">Now from reading the petitioner's brief --</text>

            <text syncTime="2459.993" offset="9839909">If he had seen Delajo, he might have speeded up ad he might have been six blocks or a mile away before he could curb him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3851.941" offset="15407752">Except -- Mr. Justice Goldberg, as I understand the previous thinking of the Court as expressed in the Rabinowitz for example and even in the Preston that a search incident to an arrest is usually one concerned with the event of destruction of evidence or search a weapon as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3873.584" offset="15494269">What evidence were they looking for in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.857" offset="15511406">Now having found the numbers doesn't infer to follow that they should have charged him with the felony rather than with the possession of the items that they found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.756" offset="15546932">It's obvious and I think that the answer to that question shows how clearly, at the answer given by Mr. McKnight that they would not have charged him shows very clearly and most cogently that this was an exploratory general search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3900.461" offset="15601789">Now we talk in terms of the reliability of the informer and again this Court in Jones versus the United States, you had the informer stating the Narcotic Jones rather than the one from Georgia, you had the informer stating that he had purchased narcotics from Earling Richardson and the Jones, the Cecil Jones I believe it was on a number of occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.418" offset="15697607">And the officers knew that this man was a narcotic user because he evidenced the -- the marks and he knew that Earling Richardson and Cecil Jones were narcotic sell -- users.</text>
            <text syncTime="3935.013" offset="15740029">And the informant say that they would find the narcotics in a specific place and all of these were filled out in an affidavit which this Court barely affirmed in my judgment as being sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.259" offset="15789035">I take the position in this case that the officer when he took time to go look up this man's record, and got a photograph of him that he had ample time to have gotten a warrant provided he could qualify for a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.584" offset="15850266">I take the distinct position that he did not have sufficient evidence to have qualified for one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.836" offset="15875344">I take the position that there was no informant in this case and that what the officer did was as was suggested by one of the justices in his question, he had a hunch or he possibly saw William Beck in this area and he arrested him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.088" offset="15932291">And for all that appears in the record and for all that we were permitted to show, it could very well have occurred that he dreamed this informer up in an attempt to justify his act of having arrested him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.060" offset="15980147">At least this much is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.658" offset="15986625">We can never disprove that he had the information that he says he had and unless we know who the informer is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.343" offset="16017345">And I think and we established a dangerous precedent if we say that an officer can establish beyond controversy, conclusively if you please, the idea that an informant told him something and that we will be limited to whether or not the judge in fact wants to believe the officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.365" offset="16093414">I think that this is a dangerous precedent because in this way we have absolutely no protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.710" offset="16114834">And I can call to mind a situation in which I participated in which this very act occurred and I cited only for purposes of illustrating the dangerousness of this precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.339" offset="16157257">That was a heinous murder in the City of Cleveland and the police were interested in searching a particular man's home because they had some information from the wife that that's where he said he was going.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.907" offset="16199576">Members of the Cleveland Police Department under the leadership of Lieutenant Delajo, now Lieutenant, then Sergeant, who is -- he was the lieutenant at that time, he was the Sergeant at the time of this case and he was also the arresting officer in Beck.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.271" offset="16257045">This officer and members under his squad made an affidavit to the effect that they had reliable information from a confidential informer that the gun used to kill that man was secreted on a particular -- at his particular address in the City of Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.620" offset="16318380">They went to a common police judge which is the Higher Court in the City of Cleveland, he refused to give them a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.330" offset="16341264">Not being satisfied they went to a lower judge in the Cleveland Municipal Court Judge, and with that affidavit got a warrant to search this man's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.255" offset="16372924">They went out and search his home and found to his file cabinet and all of his records and turn him over to the Internal Revenue after they didn't find what they were supposedly looking for, and here was a clear cut example of perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.371" offset="16413466">Officers swearing that they had confidential information from confidential informers -- a confidential informant that a gun was secreted in a man's home that which gun was supposed to kill the third man.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.540" offset="16458083">And I think that that type of phantom informant and that's exactly what it is, is possible under the Beck situation because when we tried the motion to suppress in that case the judge said based on Beck you're not entitled to know who the informer is and I think it's unfortunate although the evidence was considered suppressible on other grounds but possibly as an effort to abort any appellate procedure on the point but the idea that an officer had the audacity to make a statement based on an opinion that stands as precedent in the State of Ohio that he had confidential information with the full knowledge of the fact that we could never inquire as to even the existence of the informer I think is a dangerous precedent.</text>
