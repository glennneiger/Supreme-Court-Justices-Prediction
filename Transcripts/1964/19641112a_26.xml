            <text syncTime="26.521" offset="106057">This case comes here from the District of Columbia Circuit on the petitions of the Comptroller of the Currency and of the Whitney National Bank of Jefferson Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.415" offset="165616">At the suit of the three respondent banks all of them state banks alleging standing on the basis of competitive injury and at the suit of the Louisiana Banking Commissioner, the courts below have permanently enjoined the Comptroller of the Currency from issuing a so-called certificate of authority which is the last document of title that a National Bank Association requires, requires in order to open its doors and commence doing business as a national bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.315" offset="361221">The District Court granted its injunction solely on the ground that a Louisiana statute was effective to forbid the opening of the National Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.656" offset="418586">That statute was passed as emergency legislation while the complaint in this case was pending in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.426" offset="461636">The Louisiana Act purports to forbid any bank which is a subsidiary of a holding company and Whitney-Jefferson is that.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.590" offset="522344">From opening for business in Louisiana it -- it has not yet done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.443" offset="553691">The Court of Appeals reached the same conclusion namely that a permanent injunction against the Comptroller should issue but it reached that result by a quite different route.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.557" offset="614191">It concluded that the opening of Whitney-Jefferson would be a violation of federal law relating to the establishment of a branch or branch office of a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.780" offset="675109">The Court of Appeals was aware that the Federal Reserve Board which administers the Bank Holding Company Act had approved after full administrative proceedings the relationship between Whitney-Jefferson and its parent the Whitney Holding Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.787" offset="1911118">No, Your Honor it's quite light.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.302" offset="1917179">I do wish to make perfectly clear, however, that the objections to this action are quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.838" offset="1951347">That here we claim there is a fundamental jurisdictional bar in the Fifth Circuit, we think, the merits are open.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.214" offset="1992829">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the Comptroller was about to violate Section 36 (c) of the Banking Act of 1933, a section which adopts by reference to state laws governing state banks certain geographical restrictions upon the opening of branch offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.905" offset="2107559">Now, we think that this is a fundamentally wrong decision on the Court of Appeals' part because there is no basis as we read the relevant statutes for treating a separately chartered institution whether or not a subsidiary of a holding company as a branch of a bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.414" offset="2201600">Whitney-Jefferson to be sure is a holding company subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.738" offset="2222916">By the same token, it is also an affiliate of other subsidiaries of Whitney Holding Company but it is not a branch as that term is used or has ever been used in the banking industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.788" offset="2291148">Branch banking and holding company banking are different institutions and have long been recognized as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.140" offset="2328555">Back in 1931, in one of the leading articles in the field being Jefferson Fordham to cite one of many commentators who had been unanimous, I think, in making this observation noted and I quote from him “that the rapid spread and growth of group i.e. holding company banking is due in large part to the widespread restrictions on branch banking.”</text>
            <text syncTime="615.043" offset="2460108">A holding company affiliate as I shall elaborate later is not a branch in the language of the Banking Act and it is not a branch for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.830" offset="2515278">This I would emphasize is not a matter of insisting on correct terminology for reasons of nice fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.279" offset="2549029">The considerations which determine when a national bank is qualified to organize and to commence operations and also when a national bank may establish a branch office are committed to the determination of the Comptroller under certain specified standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.855" offset="2631367">So far as branching is concerned, he is directed by Section 36 (c) to refer to state geographical restrictions upon branch banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.070" offset="2684238">Congress, however, adopted a separate statute, the Holding Company Act in order to regulate comprehensively the establishment of bank holding companies and the operations and acquisitions of such holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.411" offset="2753620">That statute has its own standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.932" offset="2767726">It has its own provisions for the conduct of administrative proceedings and the subject matter with which it deals embraces the very question here at issue, the propriety of a holding company's acquisition and in certain circumstances of a bank subsidiary that subject matter is committed to the judgment of the governors of the Federal Reserve Board and there are no geographical, relevant geographical restrictions in the Bank Holding Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.884" offset="2919445">A bank holding company may have subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.582" offset="2934282">Many of them do in two different counties or parishes of the state, in circumstances where a bank in one of those counties would not be free to establish a branch in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.765" offset="3007007">This, we shall argue, represents a most deliberate decision on Congress' part.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.412" offset="3037623">Let me anticipate now to the extent of quoting Senator Robertson who was the sponsor and manager of the Senate Bill which became the Bank Holding Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.725" offset="3090808">He stated, and I'm referring to page 56 of the governments brief, the committee that is the Senate Committee decided against the inclusion of a provision in the bill, this was the House Bill which would automatically apply state laws concerning branch banking to bank holding company operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.175" offset="3188611">This provision was contained in the House Bill and was advocated by the Independent Bankers Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.598" offset="3218390">And then he goes on to say, “A bank branch is by form ownership and functions vastly different from a bank holding company affiliate.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1694.561" offset="6778149">There are some 1800 banking units in the country which are controlled by holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.802" offset="6811167">Now, how do this Federal Reserve Board and the Comptroller fit into this picture?</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.016" offset="6831961">First, is to the Federal Reserve Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.191" offset="6844709">Beginning the 1950s, the Board had expressed its concern to Congress that although it had some limited authority under the Banking Act of 1933 to deal with holding company practices, there was no limit whatsoever upon the ability of bank holding companies to expand their acquisitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.210" offset="6928823">Congress responded by adopting the Bank Holding Company Act and under Section 3 of that statute which is reprinted in page 81 of our brief, it is unlawful for a bank holding company to be established without prior approval of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.175" offset="7004682">Moreover, the bank holding company once it is established may not acquire control of an additional bank without Board approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.735" offset="7046896">The section goes on to state that if a bank holding company proposes to acquire a national bank, the Comptroller shall be notified, so that he may state his recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.421" offset="7101649">There are provisions for public notice and hearing at which public officials and other interested parties may participate and the factors which the Board is to consider are set forth in Section 3 (c) which begins on page 82.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.900" offset="7167582">There are five criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.426" offset="7181688">The financial history and condition of the company and the bank's concern their prospects, the character of their management, the convenience, needs, and welfare of the communities, and area of concern, and finally whether or not the effect of such acquisition would be to expand the size of the bank holding company system beyond limits consistent with sound banking, the public interest and the preservation of competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1830.165" offset="7320660">In the case of an acquisition of a state bank, the State Banking Commissioner rather than the Controller is solicited to submit his recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.196" offset="7360784">Finally, as I indicated, the Act makes provision for judicial review in the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.112" offset="7384398">Now, it follows from what I'd said I think that if the Whitney interest operating in holding company form had proposed to acquire for some existing bank in Jefferson Parish, there would have been no occasion whatever to file any application of any kind with the Comptroller of the Currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.962" offset="7467781">It would have been necessary to obtain the Board's approval of that acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.104" offset="7488366">The added element is introduced in this case only because it was proposed both to establish a holding company and to establish a new national bank as to the latter feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.275" offset="7553045">Therefore, it was necessary to go before the Comptroller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.087" offset="7568300">Now, word about his authority, he is directed to authorize a company to become a national bank if it meets standards which are set forth in the Banking Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.225" offset="7616888">This referred to the provisions of that Act alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.905" offset="7631517">He has to determine whether the amount of capital paid in meets the requirements of the statute or the qualifications of the stockholders and directors and other matters of that character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.851" offset="7691389">The Banking Act imposed no limitation upon expansion by means of group banking or chain banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.768" offset="7730991">Now, the Comptroller is essentially an examining official.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.326" offset="7745202">He makes his determination whether to grant a certificate ex parte.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.838" offset="7763278">He makes detailed examinations but he is not directed to conduct any adversary hearings and there's no provision in that statute in the Bank Act for judicial review with his determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.283" offset="7813120">The Whitney Bank first submitted its proposal to establish this new national bank that was then controlled by Mr. Gidney to obtain his preliminary approval for the establishment of a separately chartered bank in Jefferson Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.950" offset="7879784">After examining into the proposed management, its capital structure and so forth Mr. Gidney concluded that it would meet the qualifications of the Bank Act and gave preliminary approval subject to the Board's approval of the holding company aspects of the arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.816" offset="7947180">The holding company proposal was then duly submitted to the Reserve Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.187" offset="7968705">Notice was published and three banking competitors expressed written condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.855" offset="7991380">The present respondents were silent, the Comptroller's recommendation was solicited and Mr. Gidney recommended in favor of approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.481" offset="8029832">A public hearing was ordered to afford further opportunity to any interesting party to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.877" offset="8059507">This was noticed in the Federal Register and widely publicized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.572" offset="8074240">Still none of the present respondents appeared in the administrative proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.401" offset="8093571">It went forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.299" offset="8097123">The Board ultimately entered an opinion in order with one governor dissenting approving the application to establish the holding company and to make the acquisition of stock in Whitney-Jefferson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.293" offset="8149159">In its opinion, the Board concluded that the five statutory criteria I mentioned a few moments ago had been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.568" offset="8186253">It provided further that the stock acquisition was not to be affected for a week thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.036" offset="8212062">No petitions for rehearing were filed during that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.250" offset="8228989">More than a month after the Board had approved the establishment of Whitney holding and the acquisition of the Whitney-Jefferson stock, respondents were heard from for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.422" offset="8277682">At that point they commenced an action against the Comptroller charging him with a violation of the branch banking laws and only some days later did they first petition the Federal Reserve Board for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.864" offset="8339435">That petition was denied and that thereafter respondents appealed the Board's order to the Fifth Circuit where they are making virtually the same arguments as they have made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.415" offset="8409652">I'd like to emphasize that though there are doubtless similarities between branch and group banking there are also important differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.960" offset="8451762">In branch banking, all of the units constitute a single enterprise with one capital structure, one management, one set of directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.511" offset="8490005">A deposit in a branch office has the same status as one in the main office and is backed by the capital and assets of the entire bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.198" offset="8524696">In a holding company system, each subsidiary is necessarily a separate corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.397" offset="8549564">Each has its own capital funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.936" offset="8559700">There can be no transfers between affiliated banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.503" offset="8573910">Each has its own borrowing and lending limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.596" offset="8586344">Each set of directors is personally liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.521" offset="8602018">But more importantly, Congress was completely aware of these differences.</text>

            <text syncTime="2179.125" offset="8716434">Now, in the Banking Act of 1933, the Congress made a comprehensive study of group banking, chain banking, and branch banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.807" offset="8759171">It treated them differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.554" offset="8766171">For example, in Section 61 the Congress -- of the Banking Act the Congress provided a measure of regulation for holding companies, a holding company couldn't vote the stock of a -- it couldn't vote bank stock without a permit from the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.466" offset="8837851">However -- and also the 1933 Act regulated the loans by or to affiliates but it did not limit acquisitions by holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.613" offset="8890410">In the 1950s, as I indicated, the Reserve Board became concerned that there was no limitation upon the possibilities of expansion through the holding company device.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.159" offset="8944536">When a proposal to regulate holding company acquisitions came before the Congress in 1955 and 1956, the Independent Bankers Association specifically proposed that the law be drawn so that a holding company could not have subsidiaries in two different places where state law would prohibit a single bank from having two branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.144" offset="9060519">I noted at the outset to Senator Robertson's comment, let me refer very briefly, my time is running fast, to what the committee stated in its reports which appeared at pages 55 and 56 of the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.789" offset="9119138">In the middle of the page, you will notice I won't read the full excerpt that the committee states that a federal standard should determine and that the approval or disapproval of the holding company acquisition should not be referred to state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.103" offset="9192385">The ultimate determination, I quote, of public interest in the national bank system should rest with the appropriate federal authorities and even more pointedly beginning at the bottom of that page, the committee decided against the inclusion of the provision in the bill that would automatically apply state laws concerning branch banking to bank holding company operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.117" offset="9284441">The purposes of branch banking laws are not identical with the purpose of this bill to control bank holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.318" offset="9313176">It is believed that the bill contains adequate provisions to regulate bank holding company operations without an arbitrary tie-in with branch banking laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.498" offset="9361972">Thanks to us that the unavoidable conclusion is that the Federal Reserve Board was empowered to pass on this acquisition under the standards set forth in the Bank Holding Company Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2587.648" offset="10350550">I shall address myself to the Louisiana statute which has been put forward in this case as an alternative ground for granting the injunction, a ground that's not accepted by the Court of Appeals but accepted by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.781" offset="10431112">First of all, I want to draw the Court's attention to the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.805" offset="10455144">This is a criminal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.455" offset="10469773">It's a statute which reads on actions by citizens of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.239" offset="10492865">It has a section which makes five acts illegal and punishable by fines and or imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.429" offset="10529646">This section reads, “It shall be unlawful” and then follow four provisions which are not involved in this case and not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.441" offset="10569665">And finally there is a fifth section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.455" offset="10581786">It shall be unlawful for any bank holding company or subsidiary thereof to open for business any bank not now open for business whether or not a charter, permit, license or certificate to open for business has already been issued and this section is specifically made applicable to a national bank and in this case is sought to be made applicable to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.358" offset="10705398">It is not in dispute between the parties in this litigation that without some permission from Congress, this statute would be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.027" offset="10752104">It is argued that Congress has given that permission in Section 7 of the National Bank Holding Company Act which has just been referred to by the Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.413" offset="10801633">Before attending to that section, I should like to make one exclusionary point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.856" offset="10823367">It has been argued in the brief that other states have the same or similar statutes to that of Louisiana and that these statutes have been upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.802" offset="10863177">This is in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.823" offset="10871223">The bank examiner of Louisiana in his brief candidly admits that he says, “Respondent will concede that there is no other state Bank Holding Company Act which has the exact language contained in Section 1035 of the Louisiana Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.713" offset="10958785">He could have gone further and conceded that there's no other state act which has any provision remotely similar to subsection 5 of the Act and indeed that no state act undertakes to enforce its restrictions against bank holding companies by operating upon the opening or closing of a national bank so that the authorities sought to be derived from other statutes and other decisions is not correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2840.222" offset="11360862">Section 7 reads as follows, this is Section 7 of the National Bank Holding Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.079" offset="11392313">The enactment by Congress in this chapter shall not be construed as preventing any state from exercising such powers and jurisdiction which it now has or may hereafter have with respect to banks, bank holding companies and subsidiaries thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.746" offset="11462949">In order to make it very clear what the Congress meant by this section, the Senate Committee have the following in its report to the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.693" offset="11498684">It said, a great deal of concern has been expressed that Section 7 of this bill granted new authority and powers to states over national banks in general and respecting the stocks of national banks in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.274" offset="11553019">In order to clarify the legislative history of Section 7, the committee wishes to emphasize that this section does not grant any new authority to states over national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.992" offset="11603905">The purpose of this action is to preserve to the states those powers which they now have in our dual banking system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.354" offset="11633371">It is always of upper most importance a legislation of this nature to preserve the dual system of national and state banks and Section 7 must be viewed in that light.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.231" offset="11680914">Thus, if the Court please, it is clear from this statement that Section 7 neither increased nor reduced the preexisting state powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.607" offset="11730338">It expressed the congressional intention not to extend federal preemption into the field of the regulation of bank holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.511" offset="11774015">It did not narrow the field of preemption in regard to national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.487" offset="11801913">It kept open for state legislation the field in which the statute operated, that is the field of bank holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.955" offset="11835768">It did not open to state legislation the field which the National Bank Act and the decisions of this Court had closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.739" offset="11878922">This is a matter of most important legislative practice and it's an area which we would be brought in the greatest confusion if the views of the respondents were adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.319" offset="11949244">Well, for instance, let me point out how this confusion occurs in the mind of the counsel for Louisiana, the state bank examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.377" offset="11993443">In his brief he writes this, “If the Congress has preserved to the states the right to prohibit and restrict the expansion of bank holding companies,” and it has this is clearly the purpose of Section 7 to keep open to the states the right to prohibit and res -- restrict the expansion of bank holding companies and he goes on, “there is no difference between provisions which seek to restrict bank holding companies by one, prohibiting the acquisition of stock in a national bank or two, by prohibiting a subsidiary of a bank holding company not already open for business from opening for business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.473" offset="12165851">Now, what is asserted here as contending no difference is the very issue at stake in this case and the difference is as plain, as plain can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.069" offset="12212245">Provision one prevents a holding company from acquiring bank stock whether it is national bank stock or other banks stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.589" offset="12250279">Provision two, however, prevents an approved national bank from opening its doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.432" offset="12281626">The incidence of provision one falls on bank holding companies which are open for state regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.904" offset="12315585">The incidence of provision two falls on national banks which are closed to state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.462" offset="12349753">Congress wished to leave one free and to leave the other closed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3110.749" offset="12442958">If the Louisiana statute stopped the Section 4, subsection 4, it would not be invoked in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.299" offset="12473156">It wouldn't be relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.614" offset="12478380">None of its provisions would be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.159" offset="12488620">It is only when the statute attempts to keep close the bank which the Federal Government is trying to open that it is involved here and it is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.309" offset="12537208">The system which is created by the holding company legislation and the national bank legislation is very clear and very worthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.281" offset="12585064">It is provided in the National Bank Holding Company Act that states are protected against the invasion of foreign holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.840" offset="12627278">The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from permitting any holding company to buy the stock of any bank in the state which does not want that to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.675" offset="12678687">In fact, it says, it may permit the purchase of bank stock by a foreign holding company only in banks and estate which expressly by legislation permits this to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.338" offset="12725290">Then it leaves open through the state the power to prohibit holding companies altogether and to restrict the expansion of those which already exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.953" offset="12771788">There is a perfect balance and scheme in this legislation which is entirely were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.536" offset="12802090">Now, if it is that that scheme is invaded by the provision sought to be exactly held here we immediately get into most dangerous situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.965" offset="12855798">There is a con -- confrontation directly between the state and the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.543" offset="12882129">Let us presume that this state had sought to be, this statute had sought to be invoked according to its terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.133" offset="12912431">You see it doesn't read now at all upon the Comptroller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.747" offset="12926955">The Comptroller is only enjoined here, I suppose, by some theory that if he issues this certificate he will contribute to the delinquency of a citizen of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.625" offset="12974498">This is a criminal statute which says citizens of Louisiana may not form holding companies, may not open banks including national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.694" offset="13010756">Presume then that the Comptroller had issued this certificate without interference and that the state had then sought to indict and toput into penitentiary the men who were authorized by the Comptroller to open the national bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.974" offset="13071882">There you would have a direct confrontation between the power of the State of Louisiana and the authority of the United States of America and under the decisions of this Court stemming from the Cook County case in 1882, the very last session of this Court has been clear that the National Banking Act creates a complete system for the establishment, formation and operation of national banks in which no state may interfere in anyway whatever.</text>

            <text syncTime="3331.449" offset="13325793">The record in this case consists in the main, if it please the Court, of exhibits and testimony introduced into this case by the petitioners themselves mainly by the Comptroller of the Currency, in other words testimony by the president of the Whitney National Bank of New Orleans, sworn affidavits of the Comptroller of the Currency and other documents which have been filed in this case by the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.697" offset="13426730">Now, these facts, may it please the Court, the Whitney National Bank of New Orleans is the largest bank by far in the entire state of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.961" offset="13471765">It's one of the largest things in the entire southern portion of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.809" offset="13495171">For approximately 80 years, Whitney has operated its offices limited to the confines of the City of New Orleans, Parish of Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.182" offset="13536653">Orleans Parish being the same territorial limitation as the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.672" offset="13562671">Through these operations which are admittedly and concededly in this case properly restricted by a combination of Section 36 of the National Bank Act and Louisiana Revised Statute 654 to the limits of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.121" offset="13624424">Whitney has grown to a position of banking dominance where it controls approximately $500 million in resources approximately $14 million in undivided profit and approximately $27,200 in a surplus account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.871" offset="13695478">Whitney-New Orleans with these constitutional proper limit -- limitations prescribed by the Congress in the State of Louisiana and admittedly still fully applicable today has accumulated at its bank in New Orleans, its original bank in the 12 branches, 39% of the total deposits in all banks in Orleans Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.293" offset="13785130">It has also accumulated approximately 44% of all deposits of individuals, partnership, and corporations in the parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.259" offset="13820970">Now, just as in the side comparing notes figured with the figures that were presented to this Court by the Philadelphia National Bank case, if the merger which this Court struck down has been approved, it would have involved approximately 30% of the banking business in Philadelphia that is that the merger is going through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.890" offset="13895471">Here, before the plan which is even proposed, has even going into effect Whitney already controls approximately 40 to 44% of the business available in New Orleans.</text>

            <text syncTime="6003.165" offset="24012591">Number one, the question before the Court of Appeals in the Fifth Circuit is not the question which is before the Court here and the questions before this Court really I don't think it properly be before the Court in the Fifth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="6016.393" offset="24065567">So that's -- that's the danger of it, isn't it, that it is a direct review of the order that -- that you're complaining against and -- and in the Court of Appeals, you could have had that reviewed thoroughly and according to that broad language, couldn't you have obtained any relief to which you were entitled?</text>

            <text syncTime="6033.167" offset="24132650">No, Mr. Chief Justice because I think the Fifth Circuit could say quite properly that the question you raised that is whether this is an illegal branch under Section 36 is a question which should be litigated against the Comptroller who operates in a completely different procedure under a different statute to which the National Bank Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6050.359" offset="24201404">The only question to review in the Fifth Circuit is whether the decision of the Federal Reserve Board on the right of Whitney Holding Corporation to acquire the stock in the two proposed banks present city which I'll go -- wanted to talk about in a moment and the Whitney-Jefferson Bank was within the -- the statutory limits of their law to which the Federal Bank Holding Company Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6074.384" offset="24297535">You see we have before the Fifth Circuit only the holding corporation and only the Federal Reserve Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="6081.236" offset="24324911">The Comptroller is not a party and therefore he would be less free to do anything he wanted to do in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="6087.707" offset="24350824">If for any reason, we did not get to stay which would prevent the Comptroller in some way from issuing his certificate, the game would be over before the Fifth Circuit case could even be adjudicated, Your Honor, because the question is different, the parties are different and I think the question of the law involved is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="6104.520" offset="24418011">That is procedures under the Federal Bank Holding Company Act, the procedure by the Comptroller under the National Bank Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6110.706" offset="24442776">So I don't think really and I don't want to -- in the light of the situation, say that there would be no question and no matter in which that Court could pass on these questions but I don't think and I know the government has been urging that they can't pass on those questions because in the proceedings in the Fifth Circuit, the government, the same attorneys who have been representing the Comptroller here, had told the Fifth Circuit that the Board must pay us on applications for the acquisition or establishment of subsidiaries without regard to state prohibitions against branch banking, and that's number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6148.822" offset="24595226">Then they sy none of the issues before this Court had been decided by the District Court for the District of Columbia and the only issue resolved by that Court is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6158.884" offset="24635455">Now, that was the government is telling the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6161.338" offset="24645277">So I'm sort of like the poor country fellow who was caught in between one courts told, no jurisdiction because all this ought to be urged against the Comptroller and the other courts told, no you ought to go to the -- this Court, no don't come to the Comptroller, go talk to the Federal Reserve Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="6742.228" offset="26968816">Number one, he met with Whitney-New Orleans from the very beginning here in Washington before they even put the plan into operation and sat down with them and advised and consented with them on -- on how they could really get a bank open in Jefferson Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="6757.418" offset="27029629">Number two, the first step in this whole plan was to take $350,000 of money out of Whitney-New Orleans to buy stock in the Whitney Holding Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6768.469" offset="27073829">Section 24 of the National Bank Act makes it illegal for a national bank to use its funds to purchase stock of any corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6775.461" offset="27101832">The Comptroller approved it knowing well that that was an illegal step.</text>
            <text syncTime="6780.715" offset="27122834">The second step of this complicated transaction involved the formation of what the Federal Reserve Board called a phantom bank Crescent City National Bank of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="6790.017" offset="27160033">The purpose of that bank was one thing only, to eliminate all dissenting stockholders under Section 215 of the National Bank Act because under that section if a dissenting stockholder doesn't go along with the merger of that phantom bank with the Bank of New Orleans, his stock can be appraised and he can be bought out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6806.934" offset="27227638">This was step number two looking toward a complete unitary type of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6811.937" offset="27247700">Step number three was to take $650,000 out of the Bank of New Orleans and run it through the holding company.</text>
            <text syncTime="6818.997" offset="27275912">All of those Sections 1845 of Title XII a provision of the Federal Bank Holding Company Act say that a bank shall not invest its funds in any of the securities of a holding company, shall not lend any money to a holding company, shall not engage in upstream finances.</text>
            <text syncTime="6835.128" offset="27340487">So here's number three, the steps of the Comptroller has approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6838.374" offset="27353443">Finally, we get down to the end of the line and he's going to charter this thing in Jefferson Parish in violation of Section 36.</text>
            <text syncTime="6845.706" offset="27382805">So I complained here, he goes before the Federal Reserve Board under Section 1842 of Title XII, gives his approval to this whole plan and therefore obviates the public hearing on it in Louisiana, the statutory hearing where there could be crossed examination and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6861.364" offset="27445394">So we're litigating against the right end in the right court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6864.472" offset="27457829">The suit against the Federal Reserve Board when they -- when they went to the Comptroller during the course of their proceedings and said look, the minority stockholders of Whitney-Jefferson who will be squeezed out on this thing, what's your advise as to why this might be in circumvention of the National Bank Act which you administer?</text>
            <text syncTime="6881.605" offset="27526374">He refused to comment on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6883.443" offset="27533688">So we find and felt here, Your Honor -- feeling that the Court of Appeals was eminently correct and perfectly correct in every respect and we feel also that the District Court was correct in upholding the Louisiana Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6895.044" offset="27580082">But on either ground we think we're entitled to judgment of an -- of an affirmance.</text>

            <text syncTime="6907.732" offset="27630864">In the first place, I would stress that what the District of Columbia courts have done is not to attempt to maintain a status quo pending an adjudication in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6921.759" offset="27686975">The action before them was for a permanent injunction restraining the Comptroller at anytime from issuing this last document of title which this national bank needed in order to open up.</text>
            <text syncTime="6941.207" offset="27764820">So far as remedy pendente lite is concerned, it seems to me perfectly clear that if we are right in our view that the objections which are being made in this case should have been made before the Fifth Circuit, that the Court of Appeals for that circuit would have the power to do anything that was necessary or appropriate to maintain the status quo while the matter was pending before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6974.886" offset="27899507">Nor I think is there any likelihood that if there were any indication that the Court of Appeals was concerned about possible precipitant action by the Comptroller nor is there any likelihood that he would take such action pending review in the Fifth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="7074.266" offset="28296986">I don't question that this Court had concluded that the injunction of the Court of Appeals was improperly issued but also concluded that the matter should be held in advance until the Fifth Circuit completed its review that it could issue an appropriate direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="7092.564" offset="28370233">The case with its conclusion I think comes back to the beginning point and that is that the basis of the complaint in this case is that the Board, well the basis of it stems from the fact that this bank which Whitney and Chris proposed to open is owned by a holding company.</text>
            <text syncTime="7115.508" offset="28461976">Now, if that ownership is objectionable for any reason it seems to me that it must be that the Federal Reserve Board has improperly performed its function in approving the relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="7133.289" offset="28533133">But to get to that Your Honor they have to say that this is a branch in -- they are really not prepared to say that because you can't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7143.528" offset="28574093">It's obviously a holding company relationship so what they say in effect and I'm going to quote what they said to the Fifth Circuit, this is the brief of the respondent banks in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7156.452" offset="28625711">They say a respondent, and they're talking about the Federal Reserve Board, has knowingly permitted the use of the Bank Holding Company Act to provide national banks with an artifice to evade regulatory state and federal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="7172.768" offset="28691017">Now, if -- if they are right, if the bank holding company has been abused and this holding company is somehow illegitimate in its conception or in its proposed operations then I should think it's inescapable that the appraisal of the claim that the holding company is improper certainly must be for the only agency which is authorized to pass on a holding company relationship and I think the very arguments they make here emphasize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7210.519" offset="28842005">For example, Your Honors were told that this was a violation of the -- this acquisition would be anti competitive in its effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="7222.185" offset="28888712">Well, the Board has directed to pass upon competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="7225.964" offset="28903758">Your Honors were told that the source of the funds was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="7230.704" offset="28922776">The source of the funds was actually undivided profits which were free monies and available to the payment of dividends instead of paying the dividends out and the shareholders then subscribing them a new, these free monies were paid directly into Whitney Holding Company but if that were a violation of any provision of law, it would be a violation of Section 6 of the Holding Company Act and the Federal Reserve Board is supposed to enforce that Act, so that I think all of the issues which are presented if there is any merit to them which I'm not conceding are issues for the Federal Reserve Board alone.</text>
