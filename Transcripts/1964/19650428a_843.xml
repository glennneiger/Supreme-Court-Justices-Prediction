            <label>Mr. Daniel J. Meador</label>
            <text syncTime="32.746" offset="130926">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.632" offset="146495">This is a state post-conviction proceeding here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.256" offset="177006">The state court has refused to hear the petitioner's claim that he is incarcerated in violation of his constitutional rights to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.935" offset="211696">The merits of the right to counsel claim were not before the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.396" offset="233535">The question which is presented, however, is one of pressing current importance in the administration of state criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.524" offset="270002">And that question is whether this Court should require a state to comply with its constitutional duty so-called a hearing to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.788" offset="311066">The facts are quite brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.304" offset="321202">The petitioner was arrested one night in April of 1963 while he was walking along the streets in Lincoln, Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.535" offset="354116">He was taken to the jail and as he puts it he was booked on an open charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.508" offset="377940">He was hailed incommunicado for four days the a jail, and incidentally, I might say, all the facts here come from the petition of habeas corpus filed in this state trial court, the allegations of which are uncontradicted at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.347" offset="457352">He had said he was held incommunicado for four days, on the fourth day in information was filed against him in the trial court charging him with burglary, which is a felony on Nebraska law carrying a sentence of 10 years in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.393" offset="517538">On the same day the information was filed, the petitioner was taken before the prosecuting attorney where he was threatened with prosecution under the habitual criminal law unless he would agree to waive a preliminary hearing, agree to waive his right to counsel, and agree to plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.663" offset="594651">The Nebraska Habitual Criminal Law carries a penalty from 10 to 20 years in the penitentiary for two prior convictions, a penalty in addition to the sentences that would be imposed for the principal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.453" offset="649718">As a result of this prosecutorial coercion, the petitioner did waive a preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.619" offset="682423">He was taken before the Court the same day, four days after he had been arrested, at which time still as a result of the coercion, he did waive counsel and plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.170" offset="732578">The trial judge found him guilty of burglary and thereafter sentenced him to five years in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.817" offset="763193">At no time from arrest through the sentencing did the petitioner have the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.179" offset="788689">Apparently, no appeal was taken, and a few months later in September 1963, the present proceeding was initiated in the same court which had convicted and sentenced the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.656" offset="846576">The trial court dismissed the petition, the petition is now before the Court here in this case, the petition alleging the facts which I have summarized, dismissed this petition without any response from the State and without holding any hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.153" offset="920555">The petitioner thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court of Nebraska, and that Court in its opinion in effect acknowledged that the petitioner's allegations showed the violation of the Constitution which required an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.527" offset="990041">And yet the Court affirmed the dismissal on the ground that this was a habeas corpus petition and that under Nebraska law, habeas corpus will reach only jurisdictional defects in the conviction and that this claim of denial of counsel is not of that sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="264.838" offset="1059318">Are there any suggesting that there might be some other state post-conviction remedy to which the matter devoted?</text>

            <text syncTime="278.859" offset="1115429">Well, I suppose we should consider this on the premise of -- that is the only state post-conviction?</text>

            <text syncTime="284.837" offset="1139252">No sir, we need not to consider it now because the new statute which has just been enacted in Nebraska, which does appear to provide a post-conviction procedure which I would like to discuss in just a moment in somewhat greater length.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="299.916" offset="1199647">Before getting at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.674" offset="1206648">Before this statute, is there anything like coram nobis, or any other?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Daniel J. Meador</label>
            <text syncTime="305.501" offset="1221904">No sir, the law -- and it's perfectly clear and in fact the State conceded in its response filed through the certiorari petition in this Court, that there was no other remedy under Nebraska law, and certainly the Nebraska law will quite clearly reveal that.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.497" offset="1289927">The time the judgment was entered by the Supreme Court of Nebraska there was no remedy at all it explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.479" offset="1317825">Certiorari was then sought here and as I said, the State responded with this concession of no remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.780" offset="1339037">Certiorari was then granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.666" offset="1350635">Some two weeks ago, after the grant of certiorari here, and after of briefs both sides have been filed, the Nebraska legislature enacted the new statute I just mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.017" offset="1408000">My understanding, the copies of this had been supplied to the members of the Court by the Attorney General's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.763" offset="1443004">That's precisely the point I proposed to discuss at the moment and my proposition is that the effect of that statute on this case is to strengthen the petitioner's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.904" offset="1491592">It shows now that there is a way, a possible way in which the State can carry out its constitutional duty of according the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.686" offset="1526700">And by doing that, it touched the ground from under, one of the major arguments made in the brief of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.283" offset="1553032">As I read the brief state of the State's brief, one of the reason it gives for this Court not entering the kind of mandate the petitioner seeks is that there is no way under Nebraska law that a hearing can be given the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.113" offset="1608411">The argument seems to be that simply there is no state machinery available, whereby the State can meet its constitutional obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.196" offset="1640699">That argument is gone, the statute wipes it out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1354.914" offset="5419572">In the state courts, I certainly add that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.461" offset="5441829">I might add one further observation about why it is very important, desirable at this time to go up into this, the kind of mandate here and that is that it seems to me, we have here a circumstance, somewhat analogous it seems to me, what court faced in Mapp against Ohio when it looked at the exclusionary rule of the illegal evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.798" offset="5547154">We found that since Wolf against Colorado, the refusal of the Court here or the failure of the court to make that rule applicable in the state courts had really not worked well and that experience had exposed that it was necessary then in Mapp to bring the rule up in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.101" offset="5632313">We have a similar circumstance here, experience had shown, it seems to me, and time has shown that the non-enforcement so to speak or the failure of the court to require the state affirmatively to meet the obligation to hold a hearing is causing undesirable consequences tending to distort the federal system, feeding more and more cases over into the federal district court and drawing those courts into local criminal administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.703" offset="5754776">To make the state itself correct its own constitutional violations would seem to me to be a healthy thing because it might -- a state court would be a little more attentive to whether those violations occurred in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.420" offset="5817678">Not only that it's in the state's own interest that an effective and early hearing be held that prisoners not have to wander it through this labyrinth as they do now because if the conviction is invalid, the evidence is still around, and the State can retry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.149" offset="5888522">So it's an interest, it seems to me, every consideration points toward this, the interest in expeditious effective criminal administration, the state federal relationship in this field, as well as in this particularly the case guaranteeing the petitioner, some time within the span of this five-year sentence that he gets the hearing that he is constitutionally entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.927" offset="5971696">So the new statute and all that is still the mandate petitioner asked for.</text>

            <text syncTime="1519.578" offset="6078276">He wants a sanction on this remand even before the new statute was passed, that if Nebraska did not provide a remedy on remand that the petitioner be brought back up here and discharge without any evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.282" offset="6141074">Now, that's the thing that I would primarily like to make an objection to that that doesn't get to the meat of the case, to that question involve of whether these allegations are true or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.322" offset="6197185">That's just simply no way to solve the question, to bring it back up here supposing Nebraska did not have a remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1805.218" offset="7220872">One of the -- Mr. Meador's -- one his main contention in his brief has been because of the congestion in the federal district courts that we shouldn't continue saying well, if he's exhausted the state remedy, he can go to the federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.635" offset="7278446">But I say that the Congress rightly established this right in federal district court, and if there is congestion there are undoubtedly many things that Congress can do to help this congestion problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.940" offset="7323690">And that is really the question, and it's more important that the man get an evidentiary hearing rather than just discharge him on these allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.369" offset="7357440">That's really what I want to argue, so I wouldn't like to see any kind of a sanction that he would be discharged in -- if something should happen and he didn't get a hearing, I think you should go in federal district court.</text>
