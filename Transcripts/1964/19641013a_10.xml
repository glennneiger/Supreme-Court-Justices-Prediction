            <text syncTime="19.941" offset="79726">Mr. Chief Justice, and May, it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.227" offset="100833">This case comes here on a writ of certiorari and I should say by way of preface at the outset that I think that we are entitled to have the facts alleged in our petition and set out in the record -- our complaint rather, and set out in the record taken as true.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.043" offset="172095">Although we get here by way of a sustained motion to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.170" offset="200620">The facts in the case were, very briefly, that the administrator's decedent was helping in the shifting of a boat belonging to the respondent at Lorain, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.779" offset="259030">It was a bad day, the wind was high, raining, it was wet war on the dock, and wet war as a consistency about like grease and there was an odd shape to the dock which made it difficult to completely arrange a transport of the distance between the dock and the ship by the type of ladder which was extended to the decedent when he attempted to board the boat and was thrown into the water where at last, he was drowned.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.138" offset="400509">Now this brings us to the main problem in the case, which has at least three facets which I should like to outline briefly before getting into the substance of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.896" offset="455576">One is the availability of the doctrine of un-seaworthiness outside the Jones Act, coupled with a state wrongful death statute to give a cause of action to the beneficiaries and next of kin of those persons who may be killed wrongfully in state waters, even though the tort itself may have taken place under circumstances which make it a maritime tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.324" offset="565290">The second question involves the question of whether in the Jones Act FELA nexus, the classes of beneficiaries are exclusive or whether they are cumulative.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.879" offset="623491">And the third involved the question of the survival of an action for pain and suffering where there is a short interval between the time that those acts which ultimately results in death begin to occur and the time that death in fact takes place, and --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="175.604" stopTime="182.076">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="175.604" offset="702380">The Court of Appeals discussed but I don't find discussed in either of your briefs, and was this a final order?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack G. Day</label>

            <text syncTime="183.557" offset="734145">I know it was treated that way but --</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack G. Day</label>
            <text syncTime="185.963" offset="743758">I think it is for this reason, because the motion to strike took out of the petition of the complaint, all reference to wrongful death by virtue of an un-seaworthy condition, all reference to wrongful death statutes, state statutes, all reference to state survival statutes for all practical purposes, the rights of those persons other than that one in the primary class under the Jones Act were foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.652" offset="858593">So in effect, we have a final order as to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.688" offset="878655">We have it particularly since there is no other statute such as the Death on the High Seas Act under which they might bring an action even though precluded from bringing one under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.222" offset="928810">So in that sense, it was quite final.</text>

            <text syncTime="581.598" offset="2326361">Now, this leads me to some consideration of the proposition in Lindgren that the Jones Act was intended to preempt all actions for wrongful death, at least by employees basing their claim on -- against their employers basing their claim on un-seaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.319" offset="2417267">First place, may I say if I have this slightly running stock, that the Osceola case decided a long time ago, 1903 as I recall it, prompted Congress at last to pass the Merchant Marine Act of 1915 in which they thought that they were overturning the rule which had been announced in Osceola and which they read as being a rule making it impossible for an employee to recover for a tort committed by a fellow servant.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.949" offset="2571703">Now, Chelentis decided in 1917 made it quite clear that this Court at least felt that whoever drafted for Congress and whoever persuaded Congress had misread the rule on Osceola.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.904" offset="2635546">And accordingly, there came about the Jones Act of 1920, and in determining what the Jones Act wished to do or thought it could do, I think it's kind of important to realize that the Jones Act, and I'm sure, I'm bringing owls to Athens when I tell this to the Court, that the Congress had little or no debate about the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.212" offset="2732826">Such legislative history as can be found is in conference reports and does not get to the meat of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.735" offset="2754873">It simply is to questions of jurisdiction where suit shall be brought and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.546" offset="2770129">And in paragraphs, nothing voluminous at all and it is not clear by any means that the Congress had anything particular in mind, when it passed the Jones Act, unless it be that it hoped to recoup from the Osceola decision what it had attempted to get when it passed the Act of 1915.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.270" offset="2865006">And that was to make it perfectly clear that there could be a right among other things.</text>

            <text syncTime="804.120" offset="3216405">And particularly, I think, since we're now dealing with the awards of the sea, we're supposed to have a special place in the heart of admiralty.</text>

            <text syncTime="830.135" offset="3320477">Now moreover, this Court has said on more than one occasion that you do not find preemption between state and federal statutory efforts, unless a fair interpretation reveals an actual conflict, must be direct and positive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1155.159" offset="4620539">Now, in the meantime as I have suggested, and I think as Justice Stewart has suggested makes little difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.622" offset="4650423">I have suggested that it is possible to use the doctrine of un-seaworthiness, a concept peculiar to seamen to recover, utilizing as well as a remedy the wrongful death statutes of the state for the beneficiaries of people who are not seamen in the technical sense of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.893" offset="4739553">In the effect, what has happened is that we have had an attempt to make progress for a seaman which has left him in worst condition than he was before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.535" offset="4778109">In the meantime, this Court has made some enormous changes in the effect of death in maritime presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.624" offset="4810397">I'm suggesting that it is time to make yet one more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.687" offset="4826697">You have said, for example, that a state statute may be used to offer the rule that a liability dies with the tortfeasor, you have said that a state wrongful death statute includes un-seaworthiness, so that a non-seaman may have a course of action or his personal representative may after he has been killed at shore side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.019" offset="4916036">And as he said in response to Mr. Justice Goldberg's question that Death on the High Seas Act will give a remedy for un-seaworthiness to a seaman, even though would also have an act under the -- a course of action under the Jones Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1311.759" offset="5246955">Well I should say one other thing before I come to the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.785" offset="5259076">That although the Court talked about preemption in somewhat broader terms in Lindgren, it also chose to look at the language in the Jones Act, short as that Act is, to find some further support for its proposition that Congress had in mind, that there could be an election between un-seaworthiness as against negligence causes of action where only personal injury was concerned because of language in the first paragraph, the first section of the Act, and none, no such election for purposes of wrongful death because that same at his election language was omitted from the second phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.743" offset="5434932">Now for a time, this was thought to be a substantive difference, but since this Court's decision in McAllister versus Magnolia Petroleum, I think it is quite clear, that's a personal injury case and not a death case, it is quite clear that this election that is provided in the first portion of the statute is not a substantive matter but simply a procedural one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.542" offset="5534093">So we have this situation that while the expansion, the dynamism of the admiralty law has been going outward to include people who are not the special awards of the sea, the special awards have been left behind and their beneficiaries cannot recover except, and unless they're in a Jones Act situation where they are killed at shore side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.019" offset="5636075">And this rule has persisted as the cases cited in our brief show and is the case that brings us here shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.873" offset="5663451">Now, on the question of classes of beneficiaries, I must say that unless this personal representative, this petitioner prevails on the question of the right to bring an un-seaworthiness action coupled with the remedy provided with the wrongful death statute in the State of Ohio, he can get only a consolation prize or no prize at all unless the classes of beneficiaries which are provided in the FELA as read into the Jones Act, are considered as cumulative and not exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.893" offset="5811513">Candor compels me to say that this is hard road, a hole in the light of a language in the FELA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.322" offset="5837218">However, it is true that there have been examples which will show that simply being cut off, case examples which will show that simply being cut off by virtue of being in a deferred rather than preferred class under the Jones Act does not prevent another action under another statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.371" offset="5921437">The Death on the High Seas Act for example, if one chooses to file it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.582" offset="5942230">Now that is not available in this case because there is no Death on the High Seas Act available to any of the people who were involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.467" offset="5973786">I've already suggested that as far as the claim for conscience, pain and suffering goes, I don't think anyone contends that you cannot base that these days or an un-seaworthiness whether you're a seaman or not, the issue there and here is whether the Corsair rule on short pain and short suffering forecloses these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.022" offset="6076082">I suggest to the Court, as I have suggested that the place to determine that will be on trial where we determine whether or not our evidence shows, whether any considerable or at least compensable period of suffering took place.</text>

            <text syncTime="1548.346" offset="6193319">Let me go first to the question raised by Mr. Justice Harlan as to whether we have here a final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.629" offset="6226442">We objected on that very ground in the Court of Appeals that there was no final order for a review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.085" offset="6264268">Your Honor is in error in thinking that both sides agreed to have the question decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.803" offset="6291122">We did not agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.068" offset="6296242">We resisted, but Mr. Day made a persuasive argument and convinced the Court of Appeals that he had a final order and so the Court of Appeals said since -- Mr. Day urges us to do this and since the way we're going to decide this question doesn't hurt our side, why, we will deem this a final order and decide that there was no admission on our part.</text>

            <text syncTime="1605.502" offset="6421943">And when the matter came to this Court on petition for certiorari, we resisted the grant of the writ on that very ground and urged the Court to deny it because there wasn't a final order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.918" offset="6471576">Now the Court, we concluded, ruled against us on that point and I am not one for wearing out my welcome with the Court, so we concluded that there was a final order here, or at least that the Court had satisfied itself on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.082" offset="6536255">And I concluded that that is the reason that it is not argued in the briefs, and I'm looking at the law on the question, I thought that perhaps Mr. Day has a point in that the judgment below does cut off finally the rights of certain beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.132" offset="6616503">And then I looked at this Court's cases and I find that this Court has held that ordinarily, it will not review as for example where a motion for a new trial has been granted or where a denial of a motion to dismiss will ordinarily not review those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.809" offset="6691213">But there's a series of cases where the Court says “Well if an important question of law is involved, it will review.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.489" offset="6717858">Among those cases are United States versus General Motors, 323 U.S. 373, particularly at 377, Land against Dollar 330 U.S., 731 particularly at 734 note 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.682" offset="6786717">The Larson versus the Democratic Financial Committee in 3337 U.S. 682 at 685 particularly note -- at note 3, and then there are series of case saying that where a separate claim of right has been determined and I concluded that that must have been what this Court held – governed these other beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.091" offset="6876264">That was so held in Cohen against Beneficial Loan 337 U.S. 541 particularly at 546.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.598" offset="6910328">Roberts against the District Court 339 U.S. 844, Swift against Company General, I think it's a French line, 339 U.S. 684, Stack against Boyle 3421.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.272" offset="6973022">And again, some cases where the Court has said “If the case question is important and needs to be decided, we'll take it” and that's Myers against Bethlehem 303 U.S. 41 particularly at 52, and Hanover Star against Metcalf 240 U.S. 403 and Forsyth versus Hammond 166 U.S. 506.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.522" offset="7066018">So we concluded we had lost the point and that there is a final order here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1814.621" offset="7258384">That does not under any circumstances apply here because the statute expressly says it does not apply to the Great Lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.006" offset="7283984">And in any case of course does not apply unless the event occurs more than a marine league from shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.680" offset="7310629">Now this Court has never said that there is a concurrent remedy under the Jones Act and under the Death on the High Seas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.637" offset="7338527">Some lower courts have taken that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.254" offset="7352947">However, the conclusion we draw from that is not that Congress was intending to provide a remedy which would accommodate as here claimed a state remedy, but was merely providing an adjunct to the existing or other provided federal remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.723" offset="7430792">The cure -- the remedy of maintenance and cure was a long standing admiralty development and no one, I suppose, really supposed that the Jones Act cut off that remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.003" offset="7739977">Now then, going to the central question in this case which of course is whether a seaman as in this case, who meets his death in the state territorial waters may assert a remedy not only under the federal statute but also under the state of Wrongful Death Act as Mr. Day has suggested that point has been decided in our favor and we think the Court ought to adhere to that rule for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.724" offset="7878844">And the first is that there is no need here for resort to a state wrongful death statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.302" offset="7905176">The federal statute already provides a remedy in the event of the death of a seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.145" offset="7932552">In this case, there is pending before the District Court in Cleveland the claim under the Jones Act for the death of the seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.798" offset="7971109">Now as Mr. Day suggested, this Court has in some cases said that the admiralty law may apply a state wrongful death statute, but those cases we submit had no relevance here, because there, this Court was not confronted with a federal statute as it is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.613" offset="8050416">And second, in those cases if this Court had said that the state wrongful death statute does not apply, there would have been no remedy at all for the death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.074" offset="8092212">So we say that the -- there is no reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.998" offset="8103915">The reason for the rule in those other cases is absent here and there is no reason here or call on this Court now to hold.</text>

            <text syncTime="2068.322" offset="8273189">Now that's the first reason we think ought to induce this Court to adhere to the rule as it stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.538" offset="8294087">The second reason, we would urge upon this Court is simply the magnitude of the job of revising the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.127" offset="8324493">As Mr. Day made clear if the law is as it is today then we are in the right and they are in the wrong, and they say that if that law continues to be as it is at this minute then an affirmance of the judgment below will follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.322" offset="8389277">Now they challenge this Court's cases in three areas of the law which Mr. Day enumerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.760" offset="8414981">Beyond that, they say, that once the law is made tidy and ship shape in accordance with their views on those three points, then they say there are six more cases which will need to be explained or reconciled by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2282.547" offset="9130109">Now, that is not the end of the task of re-plowing the law that is urged on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.678" offset="9166681">They asked in their central question here that the Jones Act be read in such a way that it permits state provided remedies to be utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.745" offset="9210880">Now, we're dealing here actually with the Federal Employers' Liability Act, all Congress did in the Jones Act was to say that whatever rights are given to railway workers under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, those same rights we give to seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.107" offset="9280366">Therefore, it seems to me that if this Court is to say that this statute accommodates state provided remedies when applied to seamen's cases then the work of this Court for 50 years under the Federal Employers' Liability Act where in case after case this Court has ruled to the contrary is certainly cast into doubt and a whole new host of problems are raised not merely in the narrow maritime industry, but in the much wider field occupied by the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.112" offset="9416411">So we say that it's too big a job to ask this Court to undertake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.037" offset="9440131">If I may use the language of modern America, it's Congress that is the big job cleaner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.614" offset="9478374">We submit that their arguments for reversal of the cases in this Court over -- well for 34 years under the Jones Act and for more than 50 years under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, ought not to be addressed to this tribunal but ought to be addressed to Congress, because if there is anything wrong with this statute, Congress can tailor the remedy to fit the ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.917" offset="9583595">This Court cannot do so without raising a host of new problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.800" offset="9599164">So we say that for that second reason, this Court ought to adhere to the rule announced in Lindgren and hold as did the courts below and as did the Court in 1934 in Lindgren that under the Jones Act, there is no room for the application of state provided remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.267" offset="9677009">Now third, we draw this Court's attention to the claims of stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.420" offset="9697593">Now, I appreciate that that isn't the conclusive answer, but in lining up the scales to determine where the weights are to be put in arriving at judgment in this case, we submit that stare decisis is a factor that weighs and ought to weigh heavily in determining what judgment ought to be entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.233" offset="9776901">Now I go to my third -- to my fourth point that even if Lindgren had not been decided, if this were an open question and coming to the Court now for the first time, we submit that this Court should now announce the same rule as was announced by the Court in the Lindgren case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.990" offset="9867912">Now why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.588" offset="9870315">Well I'm assuming now that if we're writing on a clean slate, first because that would be responsive to congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.806" offset="9903125">Now Mr. Day says that there is really no congressional history to indicate what Congress did intend or mean by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.587" offset="9938338">Well, that is true if you don't look far enough back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.161" offset="9956624">If you look only at the Jones Act there is no history, but bear in mind the statute we are construing here is the Federal Employers' Liability Act enacted in 1908.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.277" offset="10001032">When that legislation came to the floor of Congress, it came accompanied by committee reports that said that if this legislation is enacted, it will suppliant state provided remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.179" offset="10056620">And when this Court in the Winfield case examined that statutory history because shortly after the Federal Employers' Liability Act was enacted, question arose there as arises in this case, is there room for the operation of state provided remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.025" offset="10136033">This Court examined that history in the Winfield case and said that the reports of the congressional committees having the billing charge, disclosed without any uncertainty that it was intended to be very comprehensive and to withdraw all injuries from the operation of state statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.525" offset="10206041">So we say therefore that this Court if it is an open question, since an important problem always is in statutory construction to determine what was the intent of the legislative body, we say that Congress when 12 years later it then said merely in the Jones Act whatever rights are given to railway workers under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, those same rights shall be carried over to seamen's cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.179" offset="10308650">Surely, if Congress intended to give that statute as applied to seamen's cases, a different meaning and it said it shall have in railway cases, Congress surely must have said so, but it didn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="2633.806" offset="10535184">And they unanimously reached the conclusion, that it excluded the operation of state statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.412" offset="10561620">So we say for that reason if the question is an open one, we ought to adhere to -- we ought now to declare the same rule as was declared in Lindgren.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.877" offset="10599445">Now secondly, we appeal to the -- perhaps the first rule of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.121" offset="10624418">It is a familiar rule that if a legislative body, take a state, adopts a statute which has been enacted in a sister state, that later state in picking up that earlier statute adopted by a sister state is deemed to pick up that statute encrusted with the decisions of the courts in the state which originally enacted that statute, unless the second state says “We intend now to give this a different construction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.198" offset="10768718">Now so here, after the Federal Employers' Liability Act was enacted in 1908, a series of cases came to this Court really presenting the same question that is here as to whether there is room for state provided remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.326" offset="10825247">And this Court in at least six cases before the Jones Act was enacted held that this same statute when applied to railway cases excluded state provided remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.338" offset="10881254">Now we submit that it is a fair conclusion that when Congress then says “We want that statute, that same statute applied to seaman's cases” it must necessarily have meant that statute construed as it had been construed by this Court in a half dozen cases and so --</text>

            <text syncTime="3543.091" offset="14172264">That's the 22nd item in our list of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.538" offset="14194103">Now I want to respond very briefly to the suggestion that if there was such that there is no money involved in the difference in positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.348" offset="14229316">There's a great deal of money involved because in point of fact, the person who is -- stands to suffer most by a failure to prevail in connection with the question whether or not we can use un-seaworthiness plus the wrongful death statute of the state to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.821" offset="14295249">The person who will suffer most in our failure to prevail on that point is the sister who is fully dependent and who has a mental defect as well as other brothers and sisters, but she in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.193" offset="14340702">Unless of course, this Court should hold that there is a -- an accumulation of classes rather than an alternative classes in connection with FELA, without surrendering or retreating on that point because I'd rather be defeated then to lose by concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.300" offset="14405172">I think that it is quite clear that we are not trying to read something into the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.016" offset="14428056">We're trying to say the Jones Act did not encompass as Mr. Justice White suggested, did not encompass the question of un-seaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.921" offset="14459611">It was designed to do something about the Osceola after it found out in Chelentis that Osceola did not cover a situation where a negligent master caused an injury to a plaintiff seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.181" offset="14520633">And we are trying to say that in -- there remained because it was not considered and was not dealt with in the Lindgren case, it wasn't pledged in the Lindgren case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.354" offset="14573401">There remained the question of un-seaworthiness and the Lindgren has not decided that un-seaworthiness true is not to be coupled with the remedy provided by wrongful death statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.582" offset="14614256">And I don't think it's quite apt to say, and then I will sit down, that there has been nothing since the Harbors Act from this Court, Harbor and Longshoreman Act, indicating that you could apply un-seaworthiness plus a state wrongful death statute and recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.094" offset="14672353">I think that the case of Seas Shipping versus Sieracki in 328 U.S. 85 is such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.938" offset="14699729">And of course although we have the row to hoe in connection with unseaworthiness, there are cases which have said that faulty ladders will make unseaworthy conditions.</text>
