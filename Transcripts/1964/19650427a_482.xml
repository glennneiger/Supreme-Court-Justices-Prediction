            <text syncTime="46.136" offset="184529">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.526" offset="206054">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.752" offset="222981">That Court had affirmed an order of the District Court for the Southern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.445" offset="249731">The Southern District Court, the District Court for the Southern District of California had previously attached certain conditions to the enforcement of a subpoena and orders to testify, which had been issued by the Federal Communications Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.170" offset="316604">The FCC's subpoena and orders had come during the course of a lengthy Commission investigation in the television programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.476" offset="349832">The basic purpose of that investigation was to determine whether the networks, the licensees, or others might be arbitrarily restricting or excluding the broadcast of otherwise meritorious programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.447" offset="413780">As secondary and alive purposes, the Commission wished to determine whether new rules should be proposed to cope with this important and complicated field and also whether new legislations should be suggested to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.083" offset="480235">At the outset of the investigation itself, the Commission directed that public sessions were to be the prevailing practice, but the private sessions could be ordered, should be ordered by the presiding officer if the occasion warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.183" offset="556722">In the fall of 1960, a subpoena duces tecum was served upon the respondent Schreiber.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.202" offset="580754">He was then a Vice President of the other respondent MCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.921" offset="599667">MCA, an affiliate of Music Corporation of America, was engaged in various phases of the television industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.235" offset="636865">It was a talent agency for performers both over television and in the movies.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.046" offset="664137">It was a producer of shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.614" offset="674377">It was a packager of shows and it was a representative of other packagers.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.841" offset="695275">I might say that a packager is someone who assembles the raw ingredients which go to comprise a performance, primarily the script and the stars, and this assemblage, if you will, is then turned over to the producer, whose job it is to convert it into something which can be physically shown on television screens.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Mr. John W. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="246.655" offset="986593">It was one the things the investigation was about, the extent to which the production of television programs and the authentication of them tied in with the talent agency business.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.737" offset="1050854">Mr. Schreiber was asked to bring with him two lists of documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.417" offset="1069662">One was a list of programs which MCA had produced, and this was turned over to a Commission without objection or qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.412" offset="1105607">The second list was for programs which MCA had packaged, or in which MCA had participated as a representative of the package.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.894" offset="1143536">Mr. Schreiber, at the hearing, took the position that the disclosure of this information would impose a significant competitive loss upon MCA and therefore decline to turn them over unless they are received and held under a pledge of confidential treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.773" offset="1219082">The presiding officer denied the request for confidential treatment and the -- the respondents then sought to have this ruling overturned by filing a petition signed by a counsel with the full Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.429" offset="1281672">Now, the Commission then denied the request in the fairly careful opinion which is contained in the record itself and the -- the hearing was resumed before the presiding officer in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.131" offset="1336424">At the resumed hearing, the respondents brought in their request for confidentiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.797" offset="1359099">Prior to that time, they had urged that confidential status be accorded only to this list of MCA-packaged programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.853" offset="1395357">At the resumed hearing, they requested that confidential treatment be accorded not merely to the list, but to all testimony and all evidence of any kind which might be adduced from Mr. Schreiber or from the respondent, MCA, presumably from any other official of MCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.817" offset="1479262">This was denied by the presiding officer and Mr. Schreiber then declined to testify further on the grounds that he felt confidential treatment should be accorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.148" offset="1540493">He was then excused from the stand and the litigation shifted to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.929" offset="1563690">The Commission filed a petition for enforcement with the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.341" offset="1585319">And the District Court acting on the record made before the Commission concluded that the investigation was a proper and lawful one and that the list of packaged programs was both relevant and material to the purposes of the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.964" offset="1655850">And it therefore directed the respondents to produce the lists to the Commission and also directed Mr. Schreiber to reappear for further questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.926" offset="1695660">However, it then went on to attach the conditions which is the subject of the litigations in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.186" offset="1728679">Conditions were first that the list of the packaged programs had to be received in confidence and that all future testimony of any kind in response to whatever questions might be asked was likewise to be received in confidence by the Commission, and further that if the Commission wished to have the confidential label taken off any of these materials or any of these future testimony which might be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.498" offset="1841946">It would have to come back into the District Court and demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Court that there was good cause for making it public.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.564" offset="1886250">In so doing, the District Court committed a basic error by ignoring the Commission's discretion, over this position of request for confidential treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.438" offset="1929718">After all, Section 4 (j) of the Communications Act gives to the Commission broad powers in shaping its own procedural rules and that language has been given a sympathetic construction by this Court in the Pottsville Broadcasting and WJR decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.333" offset="2005264">And it would seem that the latitude afforded the Commission, by that section and by this Court, is particularly desirable here where matters of confidentiality are concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="686.731" offset="2746828">In all candor, I'd like to make this one caveat and that is with respect to Annex A.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.789" offset="2787056">Annex A, which is the list of packaged programs, was one of the issues before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.045" offset="2824150">The other was the matter of future testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.731" offset="2838883">As to Annex A, it's our position that the respondents had a full opportunity, even under the Commission's prior rules to make a showing that they would sustain a competitive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.764" offset="2894994">So, I say that with two reasons, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.235" offset="2908891">First, they had an opportunity and availed themselves of it to make a written motion signed by counsel to the full Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.726" offset="2946821">Secondly, at the time the hearing was resumed, they filed both a written motion with the presiding officer and also were permitted oral argument at that time on the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.546" offset="3002096">But the significant point in our view is that at no time did they attach any affidavits to the motions prepared by counsel to show wherein competitive laws would be injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.388" offset="3053505">So that insofar as any prejudice might have been suggested with respect to Annex A, I would say that there were ample opportunities to have respondent's position put forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.165" offset="3108571">Now, so far as the future testimony is concerned, there, all that's being asked is that Mr. Schreiber goes back and testify before the Commission, before the presiding officer, and at that time under the rules of the Commission, he will be permitted to have counsel represent him, advice him and make objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.220" offset="3216823">The agency latitude which seems appropriate here where we deal with matters of confidentiality stemmed from the fact that such questions necessarily involve matters of expertise, informed judgment, familiarity with the regulated industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1115.639" offset="4462550">The testimony hasn't been given a chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.369" offset="4481463">Have the District Court passed upon this general rule outlined by the Commission at the start of its investigation, we feel that it would have been compelled to conclude that it was a reasonable one and I say that for three separate reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.296" offset="4577176">In the first place, public disclosure does tend to build a better record because it tends to elicit comments from interested parties and silence of course doesn't permit that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.310" offset="4597238">Secondly, a public disclosure, an open record will encourage industry acceptance of any future rule which may subsequently develop and this was an idle speculation on the Commission's part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.806" offset="4659200">The Commission in the order instituting the investigation specifically stated that one of the purposes of the investigation was to decide whether new rules should be proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.524" offset="4706011">If such rule should have been proposed and had been adopted, industry understanding would be important in the total regulatory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.584" offset="4742269">And of course, under the Commission's congressional charter, it's required to make an annual report to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.179" offset="4780617">That the Commission can cite to matters in the public record, it's in a better position to make a more complete and meaningful report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.787" offset="4815099">So that all these elements merely point to the same general preference, for disclosure which the Act permits and which the Commission directed -- prevail at the start of the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.695" offset="4874762">Since the Commission's rule on disclosure was reasonable, there remains in our view basically only the question whether the respondents had made out a case here as to why an exception should have been made for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.862" offset="4939442">They were entitled to make such a showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.743" offset="4954906">In our view, they fell far short of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.297" offset="4969117">They made no showing whatsoever with respect to damage it might stem from possible future testimonies, and there was no way they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.194" offset="5004748">Questions hadn't been asked, no lines of inquiry have been marked out and the only way in which the District Court's decision in this regard can be supported is on the assumption that every question, every answer to that question, and every document that might be subpoenaed in the future would necessarily involve not only important trade secrets, but that the private interest stemming from competitive laws in disclosure would outweigh the public interest elements favoring disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.064" offset="5136196">I think that to recite that proposition which is essential to support District Court's blanket non-disclosure rule furnishes its own reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.738" offset="5182903">But I like to point out one element which seems to me that clenched this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.189" offset="5208712">Annex A, which has the list of MCA-produced programs, was turned over voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.979" offset="5235879">This is the list of programs which MCA itself had produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.680" offset="5254687">Now, under the District Court's order, however, Mr. Schreiber couldn't be questioned about that list except in confidential sessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.939" offset="5299722">Had MCA felt that there were business secrets involved, presumably they would have objected to turning over Annex A as it had objected to turning over Annex B.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.079" offset="5344235">It did not do so and therefore I think the fact that the District Court's order would reach questions concerning the very document which MCA turned over, shows how extreme and the same extent, how baseless the District Court's blanket order really is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.912" offset="5439634">And finally, so far as the Annex A list is concerned, there was no showing with respect to any specific injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.764" offset="5479027">MCA at that time was engaged in a variety of phases of the television industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.968" offset="5507866">It was an agent, it was a producer, it was a packager, it was a representative of packagers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.384" offset="5533466">It competed with the networks, with television stations, with other producers, other agents, and it had a variety of different phases of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.781" offset="5575053">There's no indication in any of the materials supplied by MCA as to what phase of its business it was concerned about, whether it was concerned about its agency business, whether it was concerned about its production business, or what its relationships were that it felt might be damaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.587" offset="5658331">And no indications as to how much business would be lost or the general order of business and as a practical proposition, it's difficult to see how a list of programs which presumably are -- which are the things which MCA was showing, how those could be considered trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.066" offset="5760209">Now, they might be trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.888" offset="5771494">It's conceivable that they might be, although we have no basis to that effect, but it was up to the respondents to come in and show why they fell into that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.167" offset="5824575">They didn't do so although they had adequate opportunity to do so on the occasions which counsel was permitted to make written presentations as well as oral arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.933" offset="5871700">And I should like to close this aspect of my argument to quoting that part of the District Court's original opinion which I think shed some light on a rather tentative view which the District Court at least at one point had, as to the nature of the trade secrets involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.413" offset="5977652">At page 116 of the record, District Court said, “However, I am of the opinion that in view of the well-grounded fears of the testimony -- of the respondents, that the testimony to be given might resolve in disclosure of trade secrets of which competitors might take advantage”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.551" offset="6070126">And the Court of Appeals, in similar vein, on page 144 of the transcript stated that the appellees, in effect, should be protected against the improvident disclosure of possible valuable trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.617" offset="6138462">But far more sufficient, far more powerful showing is required to support confidential treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.910" offset="6251624">Annex A in the subpoena was for the lists of programs which MCA had produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.967" offset="6279837">That was the list which was turned over without objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.916" offset="6295615">Annex B was the list of programs which MCA had packaged or in which MCA had acted as the representative of the package, and that was the list which was not turned over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.845" offset="6355278">There is a thread which runs throughout the respondent's brief to the effect that somehow MCA was singled out for hostile and discriminatory treatment by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.867" offset="6407419">Of course MCA's testimony comprises a very small part of the total record of some 12,000 pages which has been amassed today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.309" offset="6465202">The networks were called, licensees were called, other talent agencies, and other producers, so that MCA was not singled out to any particular attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.668" offset="6522671">It is true that the Commission accorded confidential treatment to certain information provided by the other -- some of the other companies, but there is world of difference between the types of information which was given confidential treatment by the Commission than that which was involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.140" offset="6596545">Confidential treatment was accorded to financial data, cost data and other types of statistical material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.728" offset="6630818">Here on the other hand, no such information was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.104" offset="6656313">All that was sought was a list of programs and of course confidential treatment was not accorded by the Commission, with respect to any future testimony, such as respondents sought and secured in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1714.210" offset="6856829">And I think it's significant in this respect that William Morris, which is a rival talent agency of MCA did turn over a list of programs where William Morris have represented the packagers and this was volun -- this was turned over in response to a subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.866" offset="6939376">Nevertheless, the respondents did not see fit to distinguish between their list, which they didn't wish to turn over, and the Morris list which was, as I say, turned over by that rival agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.783" offset="6999040">Similarly, they made no effort to distinguish between the confidential nature as they alleged with respect to the Annex B documents, which they turned -- which they did not wish to turn over, and the Annex A list, which they did turn over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.040" offset="7064137">So that I think here, one can also see that there was a total failure to meet the initial standard of showing that there was some kind of substantial injury to private interest concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1941.810" offset="7767144">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.561" offset="7782191">The threshold question before this Court is I think really the question of definition of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.842" offset="7819285">The Federal Communication Commission has taken the position throughout the case up to an including the time of this argument that this is a question of an order made by a Federal District Court which has a permanent, conclusive, final aspect attached to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.446" offset="7901727">But that is not what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.525" offset="7914057">We have an order of an interim nature made by Judge Yankwich which is now being challenged and an order which in the context of the record that was then before Judge Yankwich was eminently proper and eminently designed to lead to the very result that the FCC on analysis would really I think, want to have and namely result which is time-saving, efficient, and which does not derogate from the agency function as distinguished from the Court function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.876" offset="8075494">Now, for all we know at this stage of the game, there may be no issue of confidentiality whichever becomes adjudicated on any substantive basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.941" offset="8123664">Because what Judge Yankwich ordered very simply was that the testimony should be given by MCA or its representative, be given in a private hearing originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.425" offset="8181656">Thereafter, the FCC now having had the testimony could determine whether or not it should be released publicly, or whether in their opinion it should be released publicly, whether in their opinion it should be held on a confidential basis, or whatever disposition they might initially determine to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.627" offset="8270472">It was only after the testimony had been taken and the Commission has had an opportunity to determine what position it wished to take, that the matter then was to come back to Judge Yankwich for him in effect make a determination of the propriety of the Commission ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.556" offset="8350198">All Judge Yankwich was asking for was an opportunity to have a complete record, rather than trying to determine a question on what was then a somewhat hypothetical or assumed basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.462" offset="8409757">And in the context of the record, that Judge Yankwich which was then faced with, I say that decision on his part was eminently proper.</text>

            <label>Mr. Allen E. Susman</label>
            <text syncTime="2147.876" offset="8591464">Well, as I say, it's susceptible perhaps to that interpretation, but that, I don't think was what he had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.583" offset="8622289">What I think Judge Yankwich was saying was if there had to be some reason for disclosure of the confidential material or the allegedly confidential material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.386" offset="8661473">I don't think he was concerned at that point with whether the burden of proof was on one side or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.630" offset="8686446">I think he was just dealing with the ultimate fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.809" offset="8699193">And in any event, if it were a question of burden of proof, then I presume it would be on a moving party in accordance with the usual decisions in that line including the one that was announced this morning, where I think that specific point was made as the decision was read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.831" offset="8771291">Now, I think that it's important to look at the record as I say that was before Judge Yankwich at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.992" offset="8799922">Beginning with the hearings on this particular investigatory proceeding having to do with television, broadcasting practices, and how programs were selected, how they get on the air, beginning in 1957, and actually two years before that, up until the present time, there have been as Attorney General Douglas indicated, some 12,000 pages of transcript thus far, and as I recall it some 200 or more witnesses who have testified in this proceeding with hundreds and hundreds of exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.846" offset="8939311">Of all the witnesses and of all the testimony, only MCA and its representative was singled out for an inquisitorial kind of examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.771" offset="8995004">Not only through the witness that testified on its behalf, its Vice President Mr. Schreiber, but also from a standpoint of a great many other witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.298" offset="9041189">For example, the networks, the chairman of the board of NBC was cross-examined in effect but without benefit of counsel to represent him as to whether or not NBC had shown preferential treatment to MCA in the course of the years of dealing between a producer of television programming and a network.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.052" offset="9140140">Similarly other network representatives were asked the same kind of question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.223" offset="9164800">Other witnesses having to do with the production of programs on an independent basis were asked time and again in the course of this hearing whether or not they found it difficult to obtain actors and actresses and other creative talent for their shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.219" offset="9240869">And thus we're unable to compete on an even basis or a fair basis with MCA because MCA was not only a producer of television programming, but was also a theatrical agent representing some of the people in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.216" offset="9308787">And is -- it was -- as was born out by the record, MCA at this time was -- had been granted a waiver by the applicable guilds having to do with this field of endeavor, permitting them to act in both capacities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.297" offset="9377123">But there was a great deal of questioning of this sort and as the record indicates it was directed towards the witnesses in a manner which was designed almost or tempted to design an affirmative answer to a question which would indicate some wrongdoing on the part of MCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.625" offset="9450475">Now, this happened before the testimony of Mr. Schreiber, it continued after the testimony of Mr. Schreiber in a series of hearings in various parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.697" offset="9494779">In addition, only with respect to MCA was a copy of the MCA S-1 form filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission placed into evidence, together with an analysis of that form which was designed to show again, as the comments indicate and which is part of it in the record here, that there was something strange, peculiar, unique, wrong about MCA's activities as indicated on the S-1 form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.272" offset="9629048">Now, that's the background of the case apart from the testimony of Mr. Schreiber and the incidents that developed in the course of that interrogation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2763.092" offset="11052304">At the hearing itself, the counsel for the witness was not given the opportunity by self-enunciated ground rules to speak for his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.062" offset="11104235">It was placed somewhat in the category of a consultant if the non-lawyer witness happened to recognize that a legal point was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.862" offset="11155435">He could turn to the lawyer and ask him a question about it and that was about the only function that a lawyer could serve under the ground rules enunciated in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.290" offset="11193156">And as matter of fact, when the counsel for the witness attempted to make some sort of a record to establish some greater right to counsel, then the hearing officer had enunciated, the attorney was threatened with ejection and with contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.151" offset="11264522">Now, that was the context of the particular question that Your Honor is asking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.072" offset="11284271">Also, the Commission has never recognized an appealable right as a matter of right to an order of this kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="2840.466" offset="11361802">There was no real opportunity to be heard on this subject, and confidentiality, incidentally which again I think buttresses Judge Yankwich's approach to this is the kind of thing where the more you justify the confidentiality, the more you disclose the trade secret for confidential material that you are trying to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.723" offset="11462844">That's why Judge Yankwich's order calling for in camera proceedings seemed to me so sensible and so sound.</text>

            <text syncTime="3019.317" offset="12077244">At least that has been the approach of the cases as I view them over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.486" offset="12109845">Again, in pointing out the approach taken by the Commission in this particular hearing, Mr. Schreiber had a very, very difficult decision to make as to how to protect his record without suffering very onerous conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.421" offset="12205662">It was not only question as I've indicated of possible ejection of his counsel from the proceeding and a possible contempt proceeding against the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.358" offset="12245368">But in addition, the Commission made it clear that it intended to call to the attention of the United States Attorney, possible criminal proceedings against Mr. Schreiber for failure to testify as the Commission wanted him to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.313" offset="12325198">Now, let me stop there for a moment, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.914" offset="12347559">As I examine this record, there is nowhere anything wrong that I can perceive that MCA has done or Mr. Schreiber has done in connection with his testimony given in the proceedings to which I have alluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.461" offset="12425822">And yet this one witness was alone of any of the several hundred threatened with a possible criminal contempt proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.000" offset="12475977">Now, that's why I feel so strongly that this was a case where the federal court or Judge Yankwich had to find and did find an approach to this which protected the witness against this kind of threatening action on the part of the Commission and still permitted the Commission to get the testimony which it sought to obtain from this particular witness in this particular company.</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.517" offset="12629995">The only -- there were several other witnesses Your Honor, who took the same approach I think based on the lead of MCA in this particular matter, legal approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.105" offset="12688405">There were several other witnesses I think who came after MCA who followed the lead of MCA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.115" offset="12712438">But apart from those and apart form the companies that were involved in the court proceedings in the Cohn case which is an antecedent to this case in the District Court in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.939" offset="12767713">There were a number of companies at that time who were independent producers, who also questioned the right of the Commission to obtain certain information claimed to be confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.771" offset="12815047">The difference between the two situations is within the Cohn case in New York, the Commission had indicated what it wanted by sending out a questionnaire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.464" offset="12849842">It was simply a question of whether or not the information called for by the questionnaire should be provided or shouldn't it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.350" offset="12877322">It wasn't a case like here where we don't know as yet what the Commission intends to ask the witnesses, although we have a pretty good idea that it's going to be a rather comprehensive interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.088" offset="12956317">It's also I think of importance to recognize the rules under which the Commission was operating in the course of this inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.911" offset="12999576">The right to counsel point is perhaps academic at this juncture because of the enunciation by this Commission and by others including the Federal Trade Commission of a definition of the right to counsel which follows by and large the decision of Judge Yankwich in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.774" offset="13079092">But it is important to show the climate in which these decisions were being made by the Commission and the manner of subjection of the witness to interrogation by the Commission counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.313" offset="13137189">Now also, not directly involved but I think importantly involved from this tangential aspect are the rules under which this Commission was operating at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.421" offset="13193613">The only published rules applying to this hearing was rule -- was a rule of the Commission which in effect turned over to the hearing examiner the right to make rules of procedure as it went along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.264" offset="13264980">There was no procedure enunciated by the Commission other than leaving it to the hearing commit -- hearing officer, hearing examiner on a delegated basis the right to do what he felt was proper in the course of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.569" offset="13322240">So again, in answer to the prior question, nobody could tell in the course of this proceeding what procedure was necessary to effectuate and protect the rights of a witness because there was nothing to turn to, there was nothing to look at, and it was necessary as I said to more or less go along on the basis of trying to make the best record possible under the onerous conditions that were being laid down by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.841" offset="13451285">Now, I think it's helpful to look at the difference between the results under the Judge Yankwich approach and the results under the approach of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.486" offset="13529861">If Judge Yankwich's decision were to be followed, it would mean that a full and complete interrogation of MCA and its representative could be held by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.645" offset="13594540">That information would then be examined by the Commission presumably and a decision would be reached by the Commission as to whether it wished to keep it confidential or it wished to disclose it publicly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.083" offset="13660264">It then could bring the matter in the event that it wished to disclose the information publicly and in the further event that MCA objected to that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.511" offset="13706031">It could then come into the District Court and have the District Court make its determination of whether or not the Commission was right or wrong in the approach that was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.330" offset="13757231">But this procedure would permit, I feel, the hearing to proceed in much more expeditious fashion than the approach taken by the Commission and would moreover give the Commission the information which it seeks to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.371" offset="13829433">If you follow the Commission approach in this matter, you have a series of interrupted hearings in which a claim of confidentiality is being made followed by a resort to the enforcement procedures of the federal court, followed by a return presumably for further interrogation and so on in a way which would stretch these hearings out to a much greater length than would be involved if the approach of Judge Yankwich were followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.157" offset="13956598">Now, the Commission has taken the position, as I read their brief, that even though Judge Yankwich's approach may be sensible, may be logical, may be fair, the underlying question is whether it is right as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.651" offset="14038518">I don't think the two are inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.367" offset="14049384">As a matter of fact, taking all of the cases in this field as a block, the cases cited by the Commission and the cases cited by the respondent in this case, they all ultimately lead to the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.299" offset="14105182">There is a review power in the federal courts, that review power is based on essential doctrines of fairness, essential doctrines of good sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.562" offset="14158158">The very thing that Judge Yankwich's opinion and decision was designed to accomplish in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.266" offset="14188983">I don't even think the Commission takes any issue with the question of efficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.712" offset="14206746">It doesn't take any issue with the fact that Judge Yankwich's approach will do what the Commission once done faster and more comprehensively than its own approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.095" offset="14256379">Again, as I say, the only basis on which I can see that Judge Yankwich's decision is being challenged in this Court is upon the basis of an interference with a determination however unsound, that the Commission itself feels that it alone can be termed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4229.549" offset="16918152">It is true that initially the confidentiality of Annex B was a precipitating factor which led to the District Court proceeding, but it was only one step along the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.886" offset="16987533">And in connection with this -- with the action and the inquiry made by Judge Yankwich, he looked at the record as a whole because he can see that to be the function of the federal court in connection with the enforcement of an administrative subpoena to look at the record as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.107" offset="17064333">And that I think is the impact of the law that has existed on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4270.705" offset="17082723">It's recognized by the Administrative Procedure Act, I think.</text>

            <text syncTime="4287.193" offset="17148761">I know that's the position taken by the Commission in this case as a question of arbitrariness or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.747" offset="17174988">It's never been really enunciated or it shouldn't be annunciated on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.212" offset="17196826">It's a question really, I think, of whether or not the Commission's approach is a fair and proper one, protecting both the rights of the public and the rights of the private parties involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.285" offset="17253042">And incidentally, it's that particular facet of the matter that Mr. Justice Frankfurter spoke of in the Pottsville case, which I think really pivots the question that's before the Court right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.871" offset="17311451">That's the crux of the matter and that's the question that the United States District Court has to answer in connection with an enforcement procedure before and which Judge Yankwich did in fact answer.</text>

            <text syncTime="4350.726" offset="17402880">If the Court please, the District Court specifically held that the alleged failure of the Commission to promulgate adequate ground rules to cover the proceeding did not prejudice the respondents, that's conclusion ten on page 128 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4369.190" offset="17476754">And that was affirmed by the Court of Appeals and is not before the Court in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.419" offset="17505593">Suggestion was made that the procedure outlined by the District Court made a great deal of sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.803" offset="17535164">We would dispute that proposition, but the basic question is who's going to decide what the proper procedure is?</text>
            <text syncTime="4392.130" offset="17568496">Is it going to be the District Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="4394.164" offset="17576647">Or is it going to be the Commission?</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.362" offset="17585424">It's our view that the Commission has the right to frame procedural rules and rules of this kind so long as they stay within the realm of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4406.293" offset="17625130">District Court or this Court might believe that there was some different procedure which if it were framing rules, would make a great deal of sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4417.185" offset="17668702">But the Commission is charged with that responsibility and it is the function of the District Court not to substitute its judgment for that of the Commission but simply to review it for possible abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.678" offset="17730664">There were no findings in the District Court on alleged discrimination and handling of MCA or the respondent Schreiber.</text>
            <text syncTime="4443.703" offset="17774759">No suggestion that this absence of findings, such findings should have been made in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4450.866" offset="17803389">And accordingly, this argument also we don't think is a proper issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.331" offset="17833273">As far as the purpose of the investigation is concerned, District Court held that the investigation was for lawful purpose and this was upheld also by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4471.296" offset="17885100">Basic question in our minds therefore for this Court to resolve is simply whether District Court's general presumption favoring disclosure was a reasonable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4482.670" offset="17930658">We think it was and secondly, whether the respondents had made an adequate showing that takes them out from under the operation of that general rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4494.023" offset="17976007">I think no said showing was made and that it's not sufficient for someone to come in and say, “If I make any objections, they are going to reveal confidentiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4505.843" offset="18023340">It's perfectly possible as with request for protective orders in the District Court in civil discovery, to come forward with some kind of generalized descriptions which would place the information sought in some kind of context where the Court could properly pass upon them.</text>

            <text syncTime="4561.406" offset="18245590">Insofar as Annex B is concerned, we believe that a record has been made on that point and that that particular issue is right for a decision here.</text>
