            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="61.786" offset="247118">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.403" offset="261538">This is a case brought by the United States to enjoin Mississippi officials from continuing to enforce certain provisions in the Mississippi constitutions and statutes which in their operation deprive otherwise qualified Negro citizens of the opportunity to vote without distinction of race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.141" offset="356519">A three-judge district court held by a divided vote that the complaint did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted against any of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.307" offset="397166">Its decision was based partly on procedural or jurisdictional grounds and partly on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.612" offset="430393">The central issue on the appeal as we see it, is whether the defendants continued enforcement of the Mississippi voting laws attacked in the complaint is unconstitutional, because enforcement of the statutes operates to deprive Negroes of the right to vote without distinction of race or color in violation of the Fifteenth Amendment and in violation of Section 1971 of Title XLII of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.427" offset="565708">We submit that the statutes are unconstitutional and that they are enforcement by the defendants that violates Section 1971 principally for two independent reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.719" offset="626834">First, we say that the principal statutes involved here which I will identify in a moment, delegate to petty officials, uncontrolled discretion to qualify or disqualify would be voters in a community in which every political force is mastered to preserve white political supremacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.966" offset="707814">And that that discretion is discriminatorily exercised in accordance with the original intent of the statutes and the systematic practice for well over half a century to deny Negroes the equal opportunity to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.342" offset="765283">This aspect of our case, as we see it, is based upon Yick Wo against Hopkins and in very brief it asserts that the intended and actual operation of the state laws, condemns them exactly as if the racial discrimination were written into the words.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.513" offset="838008">Second, we say that the Mississippi laws or the principal law is under attack, violate the Fifteenth Amendment because they establish new and sharply different requirements for voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.248" offset="892970">After a long period in which white voters were permitted to register and Negro voters possessing the same qualifications were not so that the effect of the new and sharply different requirements is to perpetuate a form of discrimination and this we think violates the Fifteenth Amendment under the principle in Gwynn against the United States and Lane against Wilson.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="251.787" offset="1007073">I am going to refer to that in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.516" offset="1018044">I was stating the theories at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.509" offset="1025985">I will elaborate them later so that the Court may have them in mind when I go through the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.523" offset="1050018">Because it is obvious from the mere statement of the theories that in part, they depend upon the actual facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.663" offset="1078648">The facts are those set forth in the complaint because of course, the motion to dismiss admits its allegations for the purposes of this proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.506" offset="1197976">It doesn't seem to me that there is any further need to rely on the interrogatories at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.080" offset="1220232">We think the facts that we rely on are all sufficiently alleged in the complaint.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>

            <text syncTime="315.243" offset="1260878">As I say, I shall refer to one or two of the facts of the interrogatories to show that specific illustrations of the generalization that I take it I could do that even if they weren't in the interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.667" offset="1302570">They would just be what we hope to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.279" offset="1313019">Now, in going -- making my argument and in going through the complaint, I intend to emphasize the first claim just because there is too much here to argue in an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.721" offset="1354815">The first claim is directed at Section 244 of the Mississippi Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.146" offset="1376549">And I think it really exemplifies the critical issues in the case, I'll tell not all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.343" offset="1405283">The complaint begins or the important part of this begins at 2 and 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.539" offset="1442064">The central allegation which dominates the entire case is contained in paragraphs 16 and 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.866" offset="1479367">That allegation is that it is the continuing all pervasive purpose of those controlling the government of Mississippi to establish, promote and maintain white political supremacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.396" offset="1537567">That objective, we allege in paragraph 16 and 17, was one of the principle purposes of the Constitution of 1899 -- of 1890, and Section 244 was one of its principal instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.999" offset="1599948">In its original form, Section 244 provided for a new registration of all voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.459" offset="1625757">And that every elector in addition to other qualifications shall be able to read any section of the constitution of this state or I shall be able to understand the same and read to him or give a reasonable interpretation thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.609" offset="1686361">By 1899, about 82% of the white citizens of voting age had been registered to vote under the 1890 Constitution but only about 9% of the Negroes of that age.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.061" offset="1748219">From then until 1952 according to paragraph 21 of the complaint, Section 244 was one of the principal methods used to maintain white political supremacy and to deny Negroes equal participation or effective participation in voting, because Negroes who could read were nevertheless required to interpret provisions of the Mississippi Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.273" offset="1865038">I may say, there will no lack of evidence to prove that fight.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.065" offset="1880189">For example, there were registrars who testified in hearings before the United States Senate in 1946 that they put to Negro voters seeking to register complicated provisions of the Mississippi Constitution to interpret, that they did not put to white applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.411" offset="1957616">One voter who ask if he remembered making the statement, no matter how they, Negroes, answered these questions, that they were disqualified then.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.345" offset="1993352">I think I told them in short words that they would have a hard time convincing me.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.874" offset="2011429">I think I made that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.648" offset="2026580">In the mid-50s, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit cast out upon the continued usefulness of Section 244 for this purpose because it held in accordance with the rather plain meaning of the words of the original form of Section 244, if you remember them, it always required that you would be able to read the constitution or interpret it.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.790" offset="2123128">And upon that ruling, the section became a considerably less effective instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.160" offset="2156565">A campaign was then undertaken by white Citizens Councils as we allege in paragraphs 25, 27 and 29 to amend Section 244 for the valid purpose of preventing the further qualification of Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.614" offset="2222393">It's significant that in the course of that election, the Attorney General of the State explains what had happened very vividly.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.700" offset="2262727">Under the present setup, he said as he quoted in one of the Mississippi papers, “If a Circuit clerk refuses to register a person who can read then he is liable for damages in court for depriving that person of his right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="579.850" offset="2319360">A clerk in Oklahoma gets sued and had to pay $5,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.454" offset="2337750">This scared some of our clerks of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.443" offset="2349767">And as a result in several counties, the Negroes had been voting in large numbers and then he went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.539" offset="2374113">“In other words, the only defense, Section 244, we now have is now trembling and we need additional requirements that the clerks can legally impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.200" offset="2416744">The time is short, the Citizens Councils in each community they are in the position to perform a great service if they can ensure the passage of this amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.251" offset="2453002">The amendment was the new version of Section 244.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.751" offset="2478916">It is set out on page 106 in the back of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.067" offset="2504202">In its present form it provides, every elector shall in addition to the foregoing qualifications, be able to read and write any section of the constitution of this state.</text>

            <text syncTime="653.575" offset="2614230">And then it added a new requirement, he shall demonstrate to the county registrar a reasonable understanding of the duties and obligations of citizenship under a constitutional form of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.382" offset="2677447">Going back to the complaint, after explaining in paragraph 38 as I shall explain later, how the new form of Section 244, this -- a virtually unlimited discretion of the registrars to determine the qualification of voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.271" offset="2761038">Paragraph 41, toward the bottom of page 6 and page 7 of the record, alleges that the defendant Registrars of Voters have used, are using and will continue to use the interpretation test, that's the interpretation of the state constitution and the duties and obligations test to deprive other qualified Negro -- otherwise qualified Negro citizens of the right to register to vote without distinction of race or color and then in the next sentence, it says that the existence and continued enforcement of those tests could -- well -- is deterring and will continue to deter otherwise qualified Negroes in Mississippi for applying for registration to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.400" offset="2965525">The effect of these provisions is shown by the fact that as of the recent count, 67% of the white persons of voting age in Mississippi are registered.</text>

            <text syncTime="910.121" offset="3640424">Another new statute provided that for the publication of the names of people seeking to register and then a period of time in which anyone might come in and challenge their qualifications including their good moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.882" offset="3695491">Or the effect of publication in an atmosphere of intimidation and harassment needs no elaboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.030" offset="3732062">As I say, I'm going to confine myself to Section 244.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.620" offset="3754423">For the purpose of that section in the first claim, of course, the importance of this additional event is that they show that the intent to preserve white political supremacy by denying Negroes effective participation in the political process does continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.166" offset="3832581">I come back down to the two legal theories on which we urge that the complaints states a cause of action for enjoining the defendant officials and the State from the enforcement of Section 244 as a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.972" offset="3911784">Our first theory is that the reasonable interpretation of the Constitution and understanding of citizenship test are inherently engines of racial discrimination as they have been administered just as if the racial discrimination were written into their words.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.391" offset="3989525">It's hardly necessary to ague that Section 244 is so losing its terms as to give registrars virtually unlimited power to choose who will pass and who won't pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.454" offset="4049816">For many years, apparently, the registrars were free to put or not put -- to test or not test an applicant's ability to interpret a provision of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.098" offset="4108330">I am not sure that that's true today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.797" offset="4115122">It may not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.634" offset="4118465">It's a little hard to tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.371" offset="4125466">In any event, it is wholly clear today that the registrars select the provision to be interpreted from several hundred possibilities in the state constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.289" offset="4169143">Senator Bilbo, again in the hearings in the 1940s opposed that it wasn't the poll tax that kept Negroes from voting that it was Section 244.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.191" offset="4208744">And then he went on to explain fine very vivid language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.810" offset="4223164">The circuit clerks are under oath to protect the provisions of that Constitution, and if there is a single man or woman serving in this important office who cannot think of questions enough to disqualify undesirables then write Bilbo or any good lawyer and he can give them a hundred questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.594" offset="4298292">One example which struck me which was often given to Negroes was the provision in the Constitution that provides that judges may be removed for a reasonable cause not constituting grounds for impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.979" offset="4359837">I wonder if we can all with a bit of fun think of meaning for that but I wonder how many lawyers can give a -- within the bar can give a really accurate interpretation and how many layman in the back of the courtroom could even approach giving an interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.539" offset="4434129">The registrar is also determined of whether the applicant's answer is adequate or inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.127" offset="4464431">There are no standards in this statute to guide their discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.131" offset="4480522">One of the favorite questions put the white voters if I may go into the interrogatories by way of illustration was what does the provision in the Constitution mean that provides there shall be no imprisonment for death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.939" offset="4539664">The answer was, I think that a Nigger should have two years in college before voting because he don't understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.496" offset="4573936">That voter was passed does understanding the prevision relating to imprisonment for theft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.438" offset="4601731">It could well be argued I think that such a delegation of power making the right vote subject to the uncontrolled whim of a petty official is unconstitutional on its face by analogy to the familiar cases dealing with the licensing of the distribution of pamphlets or the licensing of the solicitation of memberships for labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.331" offset="4709251">Especially here in an environment of racial hostility and where the racial purpose of the law is plain to all the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.942" offset="4751673">That was indecently the ground of decision by the three-judge court dealing with a similar Alabama statute which was affirmed by this Court in Davis against Schnell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.127" offset="4800470">We don't need to rely on that argument, however, because here, the complaint also shows that for years, more than seven decades, the untrammeled power delegated by Section 244 has in fact been administered as an engine of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.772" offset="4875076">I quote it paragraphs 38 and 41 of the complaint that the allegations are implicit all the way through it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1239.553" offset="4958145">This aspect of the case, were the allegation of those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.814" offset="4975177">We say it's precisely governed by Yick Wo against Hopkins in 118 United States where the Court held that the law would be fair on its phase to be partial in appearance, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority were so evil an eye and unequal hand as to practically make unjust and the illegal discriminations between persons of similar circumstances material to their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.982" offset="5083847">The denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.038" offset="5108088">I would go on and emphasize that our case should even be stronger than Yick Wo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.114" offset="5128359">Here, the practice in using the interpretation test to bar Negroes for voting while registering white citizens with no better qualifications was not solely the unauthorized act of the registrars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.957" offset="5183739">It conformed to the intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.087" offset="5192307">I am speaking now of intent as we usually use it in interpreting statutes and not of some motive to apply some legislative voting but of intent in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.452" offset="5233789">It conformed to the legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.724" offset="5246851">At the Mississippi Constitutional Convention of 1890 which the complaint alleges was dedicated to finding ways of disenfranchising Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.556" offset="5282168">One delegate remark, it looks as if it is referring the Section 244 was intended that if I register want a demand to vote, he would read him some -- such clause as slavery except as a punishment for crime should be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.187" offset="5340682">Do you understand this?</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.408" offset="5345593">Oh yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.750" offset="5350922">But if he did not wanting to vote, he would read him the interstate clause or the section forbidding the legislature to pass ex post facto laws and demand the construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.955" offset="5391778">And that is I have shown and as the complaint alleges that I have shown from the complaint was also the intent of the 1955 Amendment which was intended to revive this engine of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.808" offset="5451128">I'd emphasized too that the same purpose runs through other Mississippi voting laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.941" offset="5475683">And the conductive scores of state officials as alleged in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.934" offset="5495641">The 1890 Constitution was described by the Supreme Court of Mississippi as one which swept the circle of expedience to obstruct the exercise of suffrage by the Negro race, the adoption of the Amendments to Section 244 certainly have that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.665" offset="5562619">The laws adopted in 1960 and 1962 are most notably the one calling for the publication of the names of anybody seeking to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.713" offset="5606818">It showed very plainly that the entire Mississippi government unhappily still persists in the purposes alleged in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.807" offset="5651226">In short and perhaps I belabor in obvious point, whatever may have been true if only the words were whatever may have been true -- if only the words were available, the experience of 74 years shows that Section 244 stands now, not as an invitation to the exercise of the trammeled discretion in deciding who shall vote in a community where every power has been mobilized to bar Negro subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.667" offset="5770658">The original intent and the consistent practice have written the meaning in to the words which is well understood by the registrars, the election officials and equally well understood by the Negroes whom they notify that it is useless to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.304" offset="5841189">Under those conditions, we submit, any further enforcement of Section 244 in any court is as violated with the Fifteenth Amendment as I will show later of Section 1971, is if racial discrimination were written into the words of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.429" offset="5921646">Here, again, Yick Wo is squarely in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.903" offset="5939513">As the court -- this Court has repeatedly pointed out in later cases, Yick Wo held that not merely the administration of the San Francisco apartment but the ordinance itself was a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.753" offset="6006909">We say very simply to say in principle applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.466" offset="6021851">It is too late now to attempt to separate the abstract words of Section 244 from demeaning part into them by their framers and by their practical interpretation for seven-and-a-half decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.550" offset="6082142">After so long period, the defendants can't be heard to say, well, maybe we could find some way to give these tests a constitutional application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.519" offset="6134073">I think the two familiar principles that confirm this conclusion if any confirmation is needed, what is the role where the very existence of a broad statute unconstitutionally in some of its applications, operates as a restraint upon the exercise of fundamental freedoms, then the Court will invalidate the whole statute, enjoin its enforcement in total without casting about to try and sever and save little bits of it here and there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.588" offset="6266253">Smith and California is perhaps one of the best statements of that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.984" offset="6287882">The familiar cases deal with speech and freedom of association, which surely, the right to vote is entitled no less protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.268" offset="6329051">For 74 years, Section 244 has been an instrument for defeating the efforts of Negroes to vote without distinction of race and color.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.103" offset="6372310">It is highly speculative whether it could be given any meaning non-discriminatory and therefore constitutional application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.880" offset="6407419">Its continued enforcement carries inherent in it inescapably a threat of continued racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.802" offset="6443154">And under some circumstances, we say, the Court should remove the entire barrier if we prove the allegations in the complaint by enjoining the defendants from acting at anyway, carrying out Section 244.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.941" offset="6515670">Well, Mr. Solicitor General, we have the Court said about the case about Yick Wo that perhaps the case was held unconstitutional on its face that was applied in such a way by the guaranteed Equal Protection Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.791" offset="6603128">Well, I think, we say very much what the Court said in Yick Wo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.187" offset="6624653">We think that this statute might well be held unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.234" offset="6652865">We don't press the point particularly because we don't need to, because we say that in -- it has been enforced in such a way four years as to show that it is an engine of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.160" offset="6716604">And we say that as the Court held in Yick Wo and on the face of that record, the statute like the ordinance in Yick Wo should be held on constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.436" offset="6757669">We have cited in our brief half a dozen occasion on which this Court said that the ordinance had been held unconstitutional in Yick Wo as well as the practice under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.599" offset="6806361">And I'm suggesting essentially two principles that I think support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.104" offset="6832379">One is the principle stated in the Smith case that whether a statute unconstitutional in some of its application or where it's an area of fundamental liberties or where it is in -- and where its existence operates as a restraint upon those liberties then the Court will strike down the whole statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.570" offset="6910224">I think much of that reasoning lest it was at the bottom of the decision in Yick Wo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.378" offset="6941466">Then the second supporting reason we suggest is the familiar role that once a wrong is proved and here, the most serious wrong then in order to provide effective relief, the court of equity will enjoin whatever conduct is necessary to give complete relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.110" offset="7032372">And it may enjoin conduct withstanding by itself and in another context reviewed abstractly might have been held to be loved and it seems to me that that principle which perhaps we encounter most often in antitrust cases purports a general equitable principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.023" offset="7108023">You can find it in an unfair competition cases and others is also applicable to this kind of case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1817.428" offset="7269669">One of them was that in a state where there has been systematically different education for white children the Negro children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.047" offset="7320137">Then to apply an understanding, a civic test to put in short hand is itself discriminatory because you have educated one group to pass it and you haven't educated the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.533" offset="8506096">Now, our second independent reason which also goes I think for the question of relief Mr. Justice Black for attacking Section 244 as it stands today and for attacking if one can conceive it that theoretically fair test of ability to interpret the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.997" offset="8591987">Is that to apply new and radically different standards to people who are not registered today in a community where only 5% of the Negroes who are eligible -- old enough to vote have been allowed to register and something like 67% or 70% of the whites are already permanently registered is itself discriminatory as to who is prevented to vote which is what you are concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.746" offset="8710896">Because it means that the Negro the previous victim of discrimination is now in fact compelled to pass a higher -- a different test that was applicable to the white citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.101" offset="8772336">And in principle of course this is just Gwynn against the United States, Lane and Wilson as the principal has been adopted by the courts in this Fifth Circuit for some period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.375" offset="8817476">Now, that ground which perhaps we would have to prove our facts in order to be entitled to that relief that relief would certainly strike down Section 244 or any application of 244 which would be bound to be a new in different test today since there has been no uniformed valid test in the past.</text>

            <text syncTime="2232.796" offset="8931161">I turn now to the ruling of the District Court that the United States is not entitled to maintain this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.612" offset="8974420">Under Title XLII of the United States Code, Section 1971 and that appears in my brief beginning at page 99.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.194" offset="9044741">Section 1971 provides leaving out the unimportant words, all citizens of the United States who are otherwise qualified by law to vote shall be entitled and allowed to vote at all such elections without distinction of race, color or previous condition of servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.131" offset="9132513">Any constitution law, custom usage or regulation of any state or territory to the contrary notwithstanding, then you'll notice that subsection C, authorizes the Attorney General to sue for preventive relief in the name of the United States whatever any person has engaged or the reasonable grounds to believe that any person is about to engage, in any act or practice which would deprive any other person of any right or privilege secured by subsection A.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.920" offset="9267618">The same allegations which charges the enforcement of Section 244 violates the Fifteenth Amendment, the ones that I've just developed of bringing the case within Section 1971 (a), giving effect to the reasonable interpretation in citizenship test is certainly an act or practice to its conduct by the state officials and the people who give effect to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.708" offset="9370749">The state officials named as defendants are obviously present to subject Negroes seeking to vote to discriminatory test of their qualifications, deprives them of the right to vote without distinction of race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.460" offset="9441802">Only other requirement is certainly met by the complaint which alleges with sufficient clarity that the victims of the discrimination were otherwise qualified to vote that is to say they met the non-discriminate -- they met the test applied to white citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.062" offset="9516199">Indeed, those allegations as I pointed out earlier, are summarized almost in the words of Section 1971, in paragraph 41 of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.166" offset="9572624">One can look at it in its original form on page 7 or as it was amended over on our 66.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.999" offset="9611912">It makes no difference in this instance because the passage I have in mind is both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.477" offset="9633855">It said the registrars have used or using and will continue to use the interpretation test and the duties and obligations test to deprive otherwise qualified Negro citizens of the right to vote without distinction of race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.093" offset="9700310">And then in the next sentence, it spoke of the existence and the enforcement of those tests as deterrent otherwise qualified Negroes from applying for registration to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.653" offset="9750570">You'll find over in paragraph 42 (b) that the allegation is that Section 244 perpetuates prior discrimination against Negroes from possessing similar qualifications to those of the whites who were permitted to register and vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.428" offset="9825698">It goes on to describe Section 244 as an engine of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.519" offset="9846073">Now, certainly, we weren't required in the complaint to list all the events that we required -- that we relied upon to make out the practice of consistent interpretation that we alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.903" offset="9915559">Most of the particulars that did come out from the answers to interrogatories, of course ever since they got those particulars, the appellees have been alleging that they weren't part of the record but they have them available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.639" offset="9970521">Now, the appellee raises a number of objections to the application of Section 1971, which I must confess, it seemed to me, almost frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.107" offset="10020362">But, in order to try to do them justice, I want to take them up as they're set out in the brief for the defendant registrars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.485" offset="10065920">At first, they say from pages 14 to 19 that Section 1971 authorizes only a proceeding for preventive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.757" offset="10119001">But one under the request we made here is that the defendants be enjoined for continuing to give effect to this -- to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.947" offset="10155781">I can't think of anything that it is more preventive than continuing to give effect to that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.294" offset="10185143">We did ask for some other relief, and we think we're entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.047" offset="10200085">We think it's preventive but, whether it is or not, it doesn't need to be debated at this stage of the case because we certainly did include at that appropriate request that I've already mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.389" offset="10253479">Then going on page 19, the appellees say, “The Attorney General has had no standing under Section 1971 to attack constitutionality”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.810" offset="10315233">And under that, subsection C does not attempt to invest the Attorney General with authority to attack the provisions of a state's statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.530" offset="10358073">It speaks exclusively of acts or practices of persons.Well, of course, to take it literally, it seems to me that that is a fantastic argument of why you speak of enjoining the enforcement of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.500" offset="10437904">It's simply a shorthand for referring to the acts and practices of the enforcement officials to the conduct of the state officials giving effect to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.731" offset="10486909">To say that the Attorney General has no authority to attack the constitutionality of the state's statute under this section, which say that for Mississippi to pass a law which in terms discriminated against Negroes in voting could not be attacked by the United States under Section 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.817" offset="10587220">But surely, that is not either the language or the intent of Section 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.295" offset="10613133">Even the appellees have seem to find that argument a bit sticky because they go on and say on page 22, “We would not contend that a state could put unconstitutionally discriminatory action by a registrar beyond the reach of a proper proceeding for preventive relief under 1971 by passing an act attempting to authorize the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.288" offset="10709055">The proper way such void law should be said if not, would be a proceeding against the enforcement official, the registrar to enjoin and prevent his application of such statute”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.187" offset="10756702">Well, we've asked that the defendants be enjoined from enforcing and giving any further effect to the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.910" offset="10783556">I can't believe that anybody seriously distinguishes between the word applied to the statute and our choice of enforcing or giving effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.767" offset="10823053">And we have joined here some defendant registrars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.672" offset="10846668">I suppose that this juncture, the appellee might say, well, the passage that the Solicitor General just read, deals with the statute unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.344" offset="10901316">And, we didn't intend it to apply to one which is unconstitutional when it's consistent in the interpretation it showed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.368" offset="10933394">But that point, I'd come back again to the words of Section 1971 that suggests that a distinction, if that's what they mean, is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.481" offset="10973832">Section 1971 as this word show is concerned with acts or practices depriving otherwise qualified citizens of the right to vote but without distinction of race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.273" offset="11025032">It doesn't matter how it's done, it may be done by an official or acting contrary to state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.907" offset="11055543">It may be done by an official on carrying out his duty under a statute which commands discrimination on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.543" offset="11090129">Or, it maybe done we say and certainly this is true so far as the words that 1971 go, by an official, giving effect to a statute which is unconstitutional because of the rubric written on it as well as its words or by years of actual practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.592" offset="11162331">Now, if our substantive theory were wrong on that point, then of course, it wouldn't come under 1971 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.767" offset="11191066">But, if our substantive theory is right, clearly in its action to enjoin these officials, thus come under Section 1971 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.173" offset="11232653">Now, I've already stated our reasons for arguing that we're right and there's no need for me to elaborate it further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.325" offset="11277270">The other point that I have time to devote myself to is the argument raised by the State of Mississippi, that we have no right to join Mississippi as a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.279" offset="11349055">We did join her because the basic wrong in this case is the deliberate, as we see it, long continued violation of the Fifteenth Amendment by the enactment and operation of racially discriminatory voting laws, enacted for the purpose of preserving white political supremacy, action in which all the arguments of the State have joined and action as we allege taken throughout the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.746" offset="11470890">In joining the State as a defendant and I want to emphasize this, we joined the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.459" offset="11493773">We refer to the State in exactly the same sense that the word state is used in the Fifteenth Amendment and many other provisions of the original Constitution as well as other amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.346" offset="11545287">We think to joinder is clearly proper under the second paragraph of Section 1971 (c) still on page a hundred of my brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.019" offset="12756010">The Court -- both the District Court held in Section 1971 was not applicable simply because it thought there would be some constitutional doubts about its validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.478" offset="12817868">If it were construed to cover this case, we think that the ruling was wrong for four reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.060" offset="12852140">The first place, it flies squarely in the phase of Section 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.133" offset="12872516">The Statute says, whatever it is alleged that the state official has deprived anyone of this 1971 rights, then the act or practice shall be deemed that of the state, and the state maybe joined as a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.515" offset="12938031">There's simply no room for interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.605" offset="12946390">The case squarely fits the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.484" offset="12957884">Second, what little legislative history there is, as we showed in our brief, indicates that the Congress intended the words to be given their natural scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.396" offset="13001561">At one stage, the Bill was more narrowly drawn to cover the specific problem of what had been raised in United States against Alabama of registrars who would resign pending suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.932" offset="13059657">And the Bill was introduced to cover that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.103" offset="13072405">And in the hearings, it was said, well, there are a lot of other things that may happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.178" offset="13088705">And as a result, Congressman McCulloch came in with a new Bill which contained the present language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.216" offset="13116813">We think on those facts, it's certainly a fair inference that the language was intended to have its full scope and avoid all these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.366" offset="13153384">Third, there is not the slightest constitutional doubt that the United States may sue a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.869" offset="13187448">I argued such case here only in December.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.577" offset="13202286">There are many occasions, ever since United States against Texas in 143 United States on which it's been held that a state has no immunity from suit by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.933" offset="13251709">Fourth, there is no constitutional principle that a state, being a perfect idealism may commit no wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.895" offset="13283579">There are many provisions in the Constitution, indeed in the original Constitution that are plainly addressed to states, things that only a state could do like entering into a compact with another state, enacting an ex post facto law, enacting a law impairing the obligation of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.328" offset="13365290">And this Court has said that the Fifteenth Amendment was intended to have the same impact on the state as those original provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.652" offset="13406563">It may well be that Fifteenth Amendment certainly took account of the fact that states could deny the right to vote without distinction of race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.325" offset="13449300">It may well be that the consequence of the Fifteenth Amendment is that an effort to authorize someone to engage in that discrimination does not confer upon in the sovereignty of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.141" offset="13500500">So that he cannot be sued under the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.723" offset="13514815">But, it certainly doesn't go in the theory that there's no way in which a state can commit a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.523" offset="13542087">And if as it has been held that a state may be sued by the United States for breach of contract, for wrongful occupation of property, for tort, for taxes, for interfering with the activities of federal officials, then certainly it can also be sued for violating the constitutional rights of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.499" offset="13641979">I'd like to save the rest of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3423.185" offset="13692656">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.501" offset="13710002">At the outset, I think it's appropriate for me to emphasize that I am not going to stand before this Court and contend that the Fifteenth Amendment is not in the Constitution nor am I taking the position with you that the legal effect of our motion to dismiss was not to admit the allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.092" offset="13808327">Although, there is an answer on file, in which these allegations offer the most part to deny it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.274" offset="13837061">I think that the single issue that is really worthy of this Court's time and attention in this case is the issue of the constitutional and statutory ambit of the Attorney General's authority to have brought the suit that was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.434" offset="13909682">This, I think, is the point at issue that is before this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.544" offset="13938103">I think that its resolution involves a rather complex relationship created by the Constitution between the central government and the 50 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.920" offset="13979585">And I don't think that you can decide this case on Mississippi facts and wind up with a rule of statutory decision that will fail to effect the relationships of the central government and each of the other 49 states besides Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.937" offset="14047713">I think this is the real importance of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.295" offset="14061087">And I think this is the issue that the Court should consider, because I think that -- well, it's not my opinion, the opinions of this Court have held throughout the history of this Court, that the proper demarcation between where the central government ends and where the states begin is the fundamental of a Federal Republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.551" offset="14174145">This Court is the surveyor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.394" offset="14189505">And I'm saying where you're going to lay the line, I wish you would bear with me in my argument by recalling throughout, that the able and the eloquent Solicitor General of the United States is constantly before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.566" offset="14266201">He's here in Washington all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.819" offset="14279262">He presents a consistent argument for the extent of federal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.835" offset="14315311">The states who are here ad hoc by different counsel and certainly, less able counsel to hand their side of the picture to the Court in bits and pieces, and not as a consistent and uniform whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.261" offset="14388976">And, I hope as I say that the Court will bear with me in my argument with that thought in mind -- thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.851" offset="14451357">It is the position of the State of Mississippi that this suit could not constitutionally be instituted against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.525" offset="14494093">And perhaps it would be wise on this exact point to begin with a negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.638" offset="14514469">The State of Mississippi is not invoking sovereign immunity nor is it invoking the constitutional bar of the Eleventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.013" offset="14551980">This is not the concept of the State's defense that this suit could not be constitutionally maintained against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.359" offset="14589388">What the State says is that this Court did not commit a violation of the Constitution when in Eleventh Amendment cases it said that the State is separate from the individuals who compose its government.</text>

            <text syncTime="6114.332" offset="24457300">I've wasted so much time that I don't know which of the remaining points that would be best to emphasize.</text>
            <text syncTime="6119.594" offset="24478302">But let me just say that since the Attorney General made a direct point of Yick Wo versus Hopkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="6125.167" offset="24500663">And, because this is the interpretation of this case has been such a thorn in the side of so many course.</text>
            <text syncTime="6133.335" offset="24533264">I guess it's been cited as often as any case in the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="6137.150" offset="24548519">Let me just read to you if I may, what I consider the crux of the case which I think clearly demonstrates that the actions of the officer did not invalidate the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6150.178" offset="24600660">I don't agree that the municipal ordinance involved in Yick Wo versus Hopkins was held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="6156.362" offset="24625424">I think that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6157.595" offset="24630335">The Court never reached that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6159.930" offset="24639634">In the beginning, Mr. Justice Matthews said, “Our jurisdiction is limited to the question whether the plaintiff in error has been denied a right in violation of the Constitution laws or treatises in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6171.487" offset="24685923">Yick Wo was in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="6173.009" offset="24691984">He wanted to get out of jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="6174.984" offset="24699925">He would have been wrongfully imprisoned if a bad law put him there on the proper administration just like he would have been wrongfully imprisoned if bad administration of a good law put him there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6187.398" offset="24749558">So, either one of the two facets would have been sufficient to release Yick Wo from jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="6193.170" offset="24772650">In fact, the Court in defining what was prayed for said, is contained on the part of the petitioners that the ordinance for violation of which they are severally sentenced to imprisonment or void on their face as being within the prohibition of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6208.863" offset="24835448">And in the alternative, the second ground was they are void by reason of the administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="6215.500" offset="24861989">Then the holding of the Court nowhere in that case that you find this Court say, “that statute was unconstitutional.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6223.661" offset="24894589">That sentence is nowhere in the case, nowhere in the opinion, and certainly, they would not have struck -- bound an ordinance without at least that perfunctory pronouncements, rather they said, “Though the law itself be fair on its face and impartial and applies, yet if it's applied and administered with an uneven hand so that it unjustly discriminates -- unconstitutionally discriminates.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6245.888" offset="24983510">Then Yick Wo is wrongfully in jail and he's entitled to be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="6250.470" offset="25001796">And they said this is the class of case that we are dealing with here, this class of wrongful administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="6256.595" offset="25026351">Yick Wo was not a case holding that any officer can destroy a statute by choosing to violate instead of obey it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6268.309" offset="25073162">The Attorney General -- the Solicitor General claims that he is seeking preventive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6274.778" offset="25099076">Our claim in that regard is that he tells you only part of the story because with his claim, entwined inseparably in his claim which says declare this statutes void and enjoin their application, is the essential and necessary claim of “create for me,” new franchise laws for the State of Mississippi because the ones existing were applied with a bad purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="6308.607" offset="25234390">And they've now been now been made bad on the Yick Wo versus Hopkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="6313.027" offset="25252049">We disagree with his application of Yick Wo.</text>
            <text syncTime="6315.891" offset="25263543">But for this example, take the qualification now required by Mississippi that a voter be 21 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="6326.384" offset="25305443">Would this Court say that the legislature of the State of Mississippi could not pass a law stating that from this day forward, we believe that voters in Mississippi ought to be 25?</text>
            <text syncTime="6339.908" offset="25359569">Could they pass a law that said we believe from this day forward, they ought to be 18?</text>
            <text syncTime="6345.966" offset="25383811">If that law was passed, that one single change in the Constitution and Laws, would it be bad, would it be within this domain that belongs exclusively to the state?</text>
            <text syncTime="6362.567" offset="25450266">Now, let me add the Solicitor General's gloss and let's say that he comes up after the legislature has acted to change the age of registration from 21 to 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="6375.268" offset="25501048">He says, “Look, I have found some statistics from the Bureau of Census that say that the number of colored citizens between 21 and 25 that lived in the State of Mississippi is less than the number of white citizens between 21 and 25 that live in the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="6397.095" offset="25588297">10%?50%?</text>
            <text syncTime="6400.904" offset="25603553">Would the law be wrong then?</text>
            <text syncTime="6405.969" offset="25623824">Could Mississippi still change the age of its electors from 21 to 25?</text>
            <text syncTime="6412.336" offset="25649319">If statistics showed that it would have a discriminatory application if everybody in one racial group and the other racial group applied?</text>
            <text syncTime="6425.904" offset="25703549">Would the law be wrong for that reason?</text>
            <text syncTime="6431.605" offset="25726328">Would the Attorney General on the converse have a right to come into Mississippi and say, “Your law has always been age 21 but I want the laws relating to voting in Mississippi stricken down because of acts of past racial discrimination by administrative officials?”</text>
            <text syncTime="6453.822" offset="25815249">And I not only want the Court to strike out those laws, I want you now to lower the age to 18 because I find again from a survey that there are more colored people between 21 and 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="6469.475" offset="25877838">So this would be a helpful thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6472.480" offset="25889855">So while are we are remaking Mississippi's election laws, let's remake them to 18 because this would help us along.</text>

            <text syncTime="6716.091" offset="26864327">But we have outlined in our briefs, the precise reasons why each of the different defendants that he brought suit against were improperly sued by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="6731.961" offset="26927752">One other point with regard to -- with regard to constitutional adjudications, one of the basic reasons that we claim that the Attorney General would not have the right to attack a state law for constitutional invalidity would be the reason that this Court relied on in U.S. versus Raines to prohibit the attack on a United States statute there, which was that it would bring up an abstract question of constitutional adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="6762.913" offset="27051572">It's not a question as in the last case where an applicant to vote came in to the Court and said, “I am otherwise qualified and here are my qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="6774.214" offset="27096816">I applied to be registered to vote and the registrar denied me on the grounds of my race and color.</text>
            <text syncTime="6781.238" offset="27124924">He would have registered me if I had been of another race or color.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6785.926" offset="27143628">This is a concrete specific example on which constitutionality of legislation has historically been adjudged.</text>
            <text syncTime="6793.818" offset="27175184">And the United States here is saying, “We don't like this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6798.204" offset="27192738">They've been applied in a number of instances and yet the Solicitor says to you why if we have to bring individual suits, it'll be difficult to prove our case”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6807.700" offset="27230772">And he says, on the other hand that he wants you to take judicial notice of sufficient facts to hold these laws unconstitutional.It presents an abstract question of adjudication of constitutionality and not a specific question of adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="6823.586" offset="27294302">And it gets back to one fundamental rule, a rule which I believe is widely recognized in the decisions of this Court and that is that when you are confronted with the question of where a statute is or is not unconstitutional, that issue is not properly resolved by a judge saying, “Would I have voted for that if I've been in the legislature?</text>
            <text syncTime="6846.362" offset="27385417">That's not a good act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6848.329" offset="27393254">I don't like it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6849.899" offset="27399523">The question is, is there any conceivable set of facts that this Court believes are reasonable in which the constitutional validity of this law may be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="6860.929" offset="27443618">That's the proper test.</text>
            <text syncTime="6866.756" offset="27467024">We think that the Attorney General's argument is exactly an argument seeking to hold the statutes of Mississippi unconstitutional and intertwined with that, fix his new qualifications that he outlines in his complaint which don't comply with Mississippi's Constitution of 1890, which don't comply with the predecessor Constitution of 1869, neither one would bet these are new sets of qualifications conceived by the Attorney General for the State of Mississippi.</text>

            <text syncTime="7073.633" offset="28294478">There is just two points, Mr. Chief Justice that I would like to touch upon very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="7080.081" offset="28320287">During my argument before a luncheon, I spoke at various times of the statute to voting statute unconstitutional on its face, that is simply upon the words, that unconstitutional as applied to living reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="7096.328" offset="28385280">Of course, I simply wished to allude to the fact that several of the cases that have been before this Court where statutes were invalidated have been cases where it was -- the statute as applied to reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="7112.153" offset="28448601">That was true in the Gwynn case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7113.807" offset="28455184">Reading the statute alone, there was nothing wrong with the Gwynne case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7117.789" offset="28471066">It was true in Lane and Wilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="7119.740" offset="28478903">It was true in the Gomillion and Lightfoot but simply reading it alone, there's nothing wrong with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7124.889" offset="28499487">And under the Fourteenth Amendment, in addition to Yick Wo, there is of course the landmark case of Grosjean against American Press where there's a very pertinent language that I should have put in my brief by Chief Justice Hughes.</text>
            <text syncTime="7139.675" offset="28558629">The other point to which I wanted to address myself very briefly is the alleged inability to sue the State, as I understand, it in sovereign capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="7152.057" offset="28608157">Now, one thing that is perfectly clear is that the Constitution is addressed to the states as Chief Justice White put it, acting in their governmental capacity, he says in the passages that I won't read, they're quoted in out brief from the Home Telephone case, the effect that the amendment speaking of the Fourteenth proceeds upon the assumption that the states acting in their governmental capacity in a complete sense may do acts that conflict with its provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="7185.613" offset="28742426">And certainly, therefore, the Constitution contains no barrier to the United States which can sue a state, suing to hold the State within its domain, but that's what this suit is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="7198.824" offset="28795193">The Constitution we entered into it for the purpose of limiting the sovereignty of the states for one reason with many limitations in Section 10 of Article I, obviously addressed to the states in their governmental capacity, things like entering into treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="7215.479" offset="28861858">And this is a suit not to destroy the State of Mississippi, not to interfere with its establishing constitutional voting qualification but to enjoin a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
