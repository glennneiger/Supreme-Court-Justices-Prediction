            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="44.120" offset="176379">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.169" offset="188604">This criminal case here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit involves the constitutionality of Section 504 of the Labor Management Reporting and the Disclosure Act of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.216" offset="248790">On Section 504, it's reprinted at page 2 of the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.388" offset="273450">The relevant parts of it read, “No person who is or has been a member of the Communist Party or who has been convicted of a series of major crimes shall serve as an officer, director, trustee, member of any executive board or similar governing body or as various paid employees of any labor organization during or for five years after the termination of his membership in the Communist Party or where it involved his conviction of any of those crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.004" offset="431961">Violation of this section is punishable by a fine or imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.759" offset="454949">And where it is to the background of Section 504 seems relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.667" offset="474593">Now, taken as a whole, it was enacted as part of a rather comprehensive view -- review of the National Labor Policy, but a review concerned primarily with abuses in the direction of labor unions and the management of their internal affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.909" offset="551602">In the main and again taken in general, now Section 504 resulted from evidence before the McLachlan Investigating Committee which showed that a number of unions had admitted criminal elements into office of the other important paid positions for improper and often criminal purposes to the injury both of the union members and the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.460" offset="677825">A part of the remedy Congress concluded was to prohibit convicted criminals for a period of time from holding union office or from holding important paid positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.848" offset="735295">When I say for a shorthand union office, I don't mean to exclude the others in the string but that's a convenient way to express myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.823" offset="771239">Now, we're not concerned immediately with convictions of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.664" offset="798616">Here, we're concerned with membership in the Communist Party.</text>

            <label>Justice Arthur J. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="203.490" offset="813871">Mr. Solicitor General, in this respect the statute as you have now described it is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.781" offset="839053">We don't have the statute before us which would say that a union officer was convicted for example for violating the Smith Act isn't eligible to serving.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="218.947" stopTime="401.078">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="218.947" offset="875729">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.280" offset="877087">Indeed -- indeed I believe that isn't one of the crimes listed.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.748" offset="898926">Now, this is simply one who is a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.394" offset="921496">At the same time, Congress was dealing with the problem of criminals in important positions in labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.047" offset="960157">It reviewed the parallel problem although a somewhat different problem of permitting the Communist Party from taking over positions of power in labor unions also to the injury of union members and the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.595" offset="1022328">In 1959, as you will recall, the existing law was Section 9 (h) of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.329" offset="1049287">Now, the statute upheld that American Communications Workers against Douds.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.497" offset="1069976">Section 9 (a) which was designed to serve the purpose I've mentioned prohibited -- provided that no labor organization should enjoy the use of the facilities of the National Labor Relations Board, unless they were on file affidavits from all its officers to the effect that at the time of making the affidavit they were not members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.668" offset="1182616">And this supplied generally to every officer of every union that wished to take a case before the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.941" offset="1231726">In the 10 or 11 years since the enactment of Section 9(a), it had proved faulty for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.816" offset="1267252">For one thing on its face, it was an obvious upfront to union officers whose loyalty was unquestioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.535" offset="1302047">It had proved burdensome and unworkable in other respects that I'll outline further on my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.798" offset="1327125">Accordingly, what Congress did in the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act was to repeal Section 9(h) and substitute the provisions of Section 504 which forbid of -- members of the Communist Party to be officers of labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.797" offset="1407164">Now, in the present case, I must emphasize, that we deal only with the prohibition against holding union office and being a member of the Communist Party after the enactment of Section 504 and that one and the same time, the statute has a broader reach in some respect but the evidence at respondent's trial showed very plainly that he was not only a member but a rather active functionary of the Communist Party while he was serving on the Executive Board of Local 10 of the International Longshoreman and Warehouse Worker's Union, and that those events did take place after the enactment of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.038" offset="1588140">It's indeed the indictment covering years after the enactment of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.078" offset="1604232">Mr. Solicitor General, can we just pause for a moment on that and see if I read the record correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.667" offset="1630668">The respondent here, Brown, was an admitted Communist as you have said and participated in its appearance.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.534" offset="1786044">I don't really suggest there any legal consequences turn on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.057" offset="1804225">But the point I am seeking to emphasize is that this is not an instance in which the defendant was indicted for serving as an officer of a labor union because he had been a member of the Communist Party in 1958 and had ceased being a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.639" offset="1886459">Or even in 1962 and had ceased before coming a union officer being a member of the Communist Party.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="483.359" offset="1933375">The statute -- the statute is broader but I submit that the two questions are clearly separable.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.691" offset="1958661">And I direct myself only to the question we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.687" offset="1978723">On the evidence, respondent was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.503" offset="1993979">He appealed in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.902" offset="2003592">The Ninth Circuit held by a divided both that Section 504 as applied to Communist Party membership is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.411" offset="2041626">And since the validity of an Act of the Congress is involved, we brought the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.450" offset="2069734">As I understand it, there are three issues submitted to the Court in the briefs of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.351" offset="2105365">One is whether Section 504 violates the First Amendment because it infringes the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of association.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.785" offset="2155102">Another claim made by the respondent is that Section 504 violates the Fifth Amendment under some of the reasoning in the Scales and Noto cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.190" offset="2204735">And then a third issue raised by respondent is that this statute is an ex post facto law and the bill of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.920" offset="2251651">The real issue, the troublesome issue is whether the statute violates the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.273" offset="2285087">The other two seemed to me really to be quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.063" offset="2304209">Indeed the argument that this bill of attainder or ex post facto law I think is frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.780" offset="2331063">At the outset therefore, I shall direct myself to the issue of pre -- freedom of speech and freedom of association and deal with the latter points on the labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.243" offset="2384875">In dealing with the issue whether the statute violates the First Amendment, I want to emphasize at the outset two propositions which I think are incontrovertible.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.545" offset="2442136">The first is that absent the limitations imposed by the Bill of Rights, Section 504 would plainly be a valid exercise of the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.823" offset="2495216">Having chosen to support and promote collective bargaining as a means of encouraging the free flow of commerce and protecting the rights of employees, Congress was certainly entitled to take steps to prevent abuse of the power thus conferred on the union by limiting the likelihood that their energies would be diverted away from any normal trade union purposes to the disadvantage of the public and to the disadvantage of union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.580" offset="2638263">To give one specific illustration that it's only one, the exclusion of members of the Communist Party from office in labor unions is a way of reducing the likelihood of political strikes which would not only disrupt commerce, interfere with the public welfare, but also cause losses to union members without any commensurate hope of economic benefits and might well weaken and destroy the unions and impair their ability to perform the functions that the National Labor Policy gives.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.782" offset="2787056">The interest in that diversion of union energy, as we say, and the resulting injuries to the public and to the union members certainly matters within the legitimate scope of governmental concern, the legitimate scope of legislative concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.507" offset="2865946">I should also emphasize in this connection that there's nothing noble about the approach of Section 504 although of course as we shall see in a moment it comes closer to affecting freedom of speech and freedom of association than it's analyzed.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.275" offset="2933029">But the principle that a man shall not serve two masters or attempt to serve two masters, is a very old one.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.637" offset="2966465">The common law recognized the evil in man's occupying dual positions in which they would be subject to conflicting loyalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.723" offset="2998857">The United States Code is for all instances in which government officials are forbidden to hold interest in private enterprises with which they may have to deal, the provision outlying interlocking directorates is a familiar one and the Board of Governors against Agnew this Court had before it a provision forbidding a partner or employee of an investment banking house from serving as an officer or director of a federal reserve bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.974" offset="3131873">This is in other words a rather familiar technique and here in effect what Congress has done is the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.765" offset="3175027">It is said that a man shall not or while he's a member of the Communist Party and therefore presumably subject to loyalty to it and perhaps to its discipline at the same time hold office in a labor union where he may be disabled because of those conflicting loyalties from performing his obligations to the union members and to the public faithfully and wholeheartedly.</text>

            <text syncTime="855.078" offset="3420264">If there were a parallel in the history of our industrial relations, they parallel in the evidence that was available, then I would think that there would be one and only one important difference and that is that this Court has repeatedly recognized that the Communist Party is different from most other organization that it is subject to domination by a power and that this greatly increases many of the threats that it presents.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.344" offset="3561326">Whether that would be a decisive difference I don't mean to say but I think it's a difference in our favor in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.322" offset="3593195">I would also doubt, Mr. Chief Justice, so I confess I don't know the evidence whether the record of history would be as persuasive on that point in terms of effect through labor unions as the evidence dealing with the Communist Party because I don't believe that there is any evidence that the Ku Klux Klan has engaged in its activities through labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.901" offset="3695595">And I would think therefore that a law forbidding members of the Klan from being officers of labor unions came much closer to being a penalty, a sanction than a prophylactic measure directed at future dangers which is what we think this statute is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1566.331" offset="6265313">That under a line of cases beginning back with United Public Workers against Mitchell, it's been held that an indirect collateral consequential or partial abridgement as it was set in Douds of the freedoms of speech or association resulting from congressional action directed at some evil conduct that the Congress has the right to deal with is not to be judged simply by whether the statute does have some impact upon speech but it is to be judged by whether the incidental impact on speech cannot be justified by the need for a remedy for dealing with some evil within the scope of congressional concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.899" offset="6507520">We think that's established by United Public Workers against Mitchell and the whole line of cases running through Douds, Adler against Board of Education, Garner against the Board of Supervisors in Los Angeles, that the holdings of those cases were recognized in Speiser and Randall, recognized again subsequently in the -- the case involving a lawyer from Konigsberg against State Bar and that one must make this inquiry by this balancing if you will in this case unless a whole line of this Court's precedents are to be overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.301" offset="6677107">I turn therefore to examine the public interest which Section 504 is designed to secure and that as I've said of course is to prevent persons whose dominant loyalty is to the Communist Party from subverting labor unions to the wishes of a foreign dominated conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.707" offset="6766759">The factual background was elaborately briefed in the Douds case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.345" offset="6785358">The Court after reviewing it concluded, Congress had a great mass of material before it which tended to show that Communists had infiltrated union organizations not to support in further trade union objectives including the advocacy of change by democratic means but to make them device by which commerce and industry might be disrupted when the dictates of political policy required such action.</text>

            <text syncTime="2567.149" offset="10268526">The fir -- one difference, one trouble with Section 9 (h) was that it was ineffectual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.860" offset="10295380">One have -- one violated it only if he was a member of the Communist Party at the moment he swore to the affidavit and this invited people to resign their membership, make the affidavit and then resume membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.926" offset="10359641">And there are some statements, some testimony to the effect that that happened on a substantial scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.401" offset="10389525">It is also true that there was always the possibility that a strong well-organized union, a union with the economic strength to do the most damage could ignore the facilities of the National Labor Relations Board and retain its Communist member officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2630.698" offset="10522749">No one's ever suggested the mine workers or the typographers the only two internationals that stayed outside had any Communist domination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2645.049" offset="10580114">Second, Section 9 (h) posed an enormous administrative burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.200" offset="10612715">Every time a union instituted a case, you have to check whether all its officers and all the officers of any parent organization of what currently in compliance with these involved stacks of filing cases of hundreds of thousands of affidavits to be checked over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.107" offset="10684395">Furthermore, and more important, I think, Section 9 (h) was unsound from the standpoint of labor management relations and inequitable from the standpoint of employees and union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.338" offset="10741342">Under Section 9 (f), union members lost much of the protection of the National Labor Relations Act whenever an individual officer was unwilling to file the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.493" offset="10797871">The officer was not ousted, the danger was not substantially alleviated and the employees suffered the most.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.370" offset="10833398">Alright, now I would emphasize that this withdrawing protection from employees while it affects economic rights, I submit to you seriously, also affects a right to freedom of association and affects, whether it affects the right to bargain collectively, that too is not simply an economic right or even striking, picketed, are not solely economic rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.756" offset="10930991">And there's an element of individual liberty and association of freedom on that side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.787" offset="10955128">Furthermore, since Section 9 (h) simply withdrew the facilities of the Labor Board, this put in many ways the effect of sanction is in the hands of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.987" offset="11007896">He could bargain with the union if he wanted to or he could raise the technical objection if he wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.160" offset="11032555">Or if he wanted to delay or obstruct proceedings before the Board, he could raise questions of bulk of clients of questions of statutory interpretation as well as take advantage of negligence in filing affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.744" offset="11082919">Now, this was, as we explained in our brief a very, very real problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.967" offset="11103817">And as I submit while those may seem technical at the outset, that they do affect the full freedom of association and collective bargaining by employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.134" offset="11152509">Fourth and most important, Section 9 (h) was in the front to union officers generally because it singled them out from the entire community and required them unlike all other citizens how to file oaths that they were not members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.055" offset="11240176">The interest did not being subjected to such an upfront.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.833" offset="11255327">The interest did not having to take a test oath, I submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.890" offset="11275494">It is certainly very close to a First Amendment right, if it is not in fact the First Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.020" offset="11300049">And it would seem to me that Congress could surely give effect to that consideration in devising a remedy for this evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.990" offset="11335889">Now, if you tote these things up, when it comes to I think is this, one that Section 504 is a more effective measure both administratively and in terms of reaching the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.234" offset="11396911">Second, while it does, as Mr. Justice Black has suggested, put more pressure on the man, the member of the Communist Party to choose between such membership and union officers because it's an absolute prohibition against doing both and not simply a pressure on the union to put pressure on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.252" offset="11496908">And to that extent it is a greater infringement of freedom for association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.042" offset="11516134">Still against that have to be balanced of both the gains in terms of the employees' freedom of association, the union members' freedom of association, and the non-Communist officers and the employees being relieved of the necessity of taking a test oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.377" offset="11589486">I would say that whatever when they think of the merits or demerits of this statute that it was a very great improvement over Section 9 (h) on net effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.503" offset="11633998">From an overall point of view despite the clear difference on one point it does distinguish Douds case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.141" offset="11664509">But to look at it as a whole, I would argue that this is not a greater restriction than what was sustained in Douds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.400" offset="11701499">Now, I would like to take a few moments to deal with other points raised in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.682" offset="11734727">One was that this was -- the sanction was a criminal penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.392" offset="11761476">What I am trying to say is that the fact that this is an absolute prohibition as distinguished from a stimulus is of course relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.719" offset="11802854">And I've tried to express the reasons for thinking that it is permissible to have the absolute prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.781" offset="11827096">If it is permissible to have the absolute prohibition, then I submit most strenuously that it can't matter whether you enforce it by quo warranto or by criminal penalties or by an injunction or by any other means of enforcing that absolute prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.325" offset="11909224">Because criminal laws aren't bribes to do and pay the penalty or comply with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.865" offset="11939422">The duty is to comply with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.376" offset="11949453">The other case where the character of the penalty might be relevant or where the statute is vague and a very heavy penalty would put pressure on one to stay on the right side of the line is not involved here, but in the application of this statute, its meaning are perfectly clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="3305.752" offset="13222975">That they had no relation to each other, now of course any statute that takes a particular group that the statute says that “No man over 30 years old shall be officers of labor union.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3358.293" offset="13433104">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.729" offset="13458913">I quite agree with the Solicitor that the three basic issues presented here have to do with the validity or invalidity of this statute under the First Amendment, under the First Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment, and under the provisions that prohibit the adoption of bills of attainder or ex post facto laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.198" offset="13548774">I'm satisfied he is understating the case when he says that the First Amendment presents for him a real troublesome issue and I'm more than satisfied that he's completely wrong when he characterizes as frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.612" offset="13606348">Our contention that this Section 504 is plainly a bill of attainder, and I am led to believe that he is not as acquainted as perhaps he ought to be with what takes place when a man is indicted, arraigned and tried in a cri -- Court of Criminal Justice when he says that there is no, no presentation here of serious questions under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.533" offset="13710106">Now this section, may it please Your Honors, became law on September 14, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.414" offset="13753574">On that day, my client who had been working as a longshoreman on the San Francisco Waterfront for nearly 25 years, was already a member of the executive board of his local union, Local 10 of the IOWU whose membership varied between four and five thousand during the period that we're concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.742" offset="13850958">He had been elected in the November 1958 elections for one year term on a -- on a Board that comprises 35 working longshoremen that comprise that Board plus six officers who are not working longshoremen that is to say they -- they work for the union and perform services for it, a total therefore of 41 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.337" offset="13953254">So that when this law was adopted by Congress on September 14, 1959 and it had as a provision in it becoming effective of that day that it was a crime for him to continue in office as the elected representative of the men who had voted for him in a full and fair, and free election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.044" offset="14052101">He was presented with certain choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.422" offset="14065685">He, could of course, and I take it this is what the counsel argues he should have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.421" offset="14089613">He could have resigned from the Communist Party but of course that wouldn't do any good with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.859" offset="14119393">Because the provision in 504 says that you may not hold union office if you are a member of the Communist Party or if you have held such membership at any time within five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.454" offset="14173727">So resigning from the party would have availed them nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.379" offset="14189505">He could of course have resigned from the executive board of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.595" offset="14210299">And this apparently is what the government thinks he should have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.336" offset="14225241">In doing so, he would have surrendered not only his right to continue to serve the man who had imposed their confidence in him and selected him in a full and fair election as the man they wanted to represent them, but he would have also had to surrender their right, wouldn't he?</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.970" offset="14295876">Because he would have had to frustrate the election process in which the four or five thousand members of his union had participated by saying, “Well, I can't serve as your officer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.105" offset="14352405">“Why not?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.952" offset="14355749">“Well Congress has said I can't.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.683" offset="14362645">“Well we decided that you should.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.705" offset="14374766">So he remained until the end of his term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.280" offset="14385110">And as a matter of fact, the membership proposed him for reelection in 1959 and he was reelected and served for the year 1960 and they reelected him again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.556" offset="14442162">And he was serving his third term on the board at the time the indictment was returned in May of 1961.</text>

            <text syncTime="4930.635" offset="19722449">I would think so rather than wait and endanger the foundations of the republic while a test is going up in the courts that they would go after everybody whom the FBI told them was a member open or concealed who also occupied union office.</text>
            <text syncTime="4944.610" offset="19778351">Presumably, we certainly know that they have such -- such informants, the one appeared in this case and testified forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.948" offset="19803742">Well, it seems to me that we have to first understand clearly that the abridgement of the First Amendment rights is -- is automatically achieved by this statute and no better way of showing that I think exist than to contrast what was said by this Court through the opinion of the Chief Justice in the Douds case and this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4976.904" offset="19907605">Your Honors will find at pages 38 to 39 of our brief the five basic points of difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.824" offset="19939265">The first is that under Section 9 (h), there was no specific prohibition against the persons holding union office although they were also Communist Party members.</text>
            <text syncTime="4998.926" offset="19995690">No discharge in the union office was required, that's the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="5002.839" offset="20011259">Here of course the prohibition is absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.225" offset="20020872">Second, in the Douds case, stress was placed upon the fact that the statute resulted only in an indirect conditional partial abridgement of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="5014.638" offset="20058488">That is to say it discouraged membership in the Communist Party to the extent that labor unions might be pinched not to elect the Communist through office.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.424" offset="20101642">So the Court said that was a partial unconditioned -- conditional and indirect abridgment, a little one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5032.743" offset="20130900">The third, Douds pointed out that there was no punishment involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.366" offset="20153365">He said specifically 9 (h) does not prevent or punish by criminal sanctions the making of speech or affiliation with any organization or holding or any belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.221" offset="20192862">Well, of course here, the Communist Party membership is one of the two elements of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5054.614" offset="20218358">Two things that are required, one is Communist Party membership and the other is the holding of union office.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.947" offset="20235703">So here you have just the opposite of Douds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5062.493" offset="20249913">You have a punishment for membership in an organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.226" offset="20268826">Fourth, the handful of people to which Douds applied was brought out in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5073.789" offset="20295053">The Chief Justice said it touches only a relative handful of persons living the great majority of persons of the identified affiliations and beliefs completely free from restraint and at least those few who are affected, free to maintain their affiliations and beliefs subject only to possible loss of position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.722" offset="20358792">Now there, what was being referred to is the fact that under 9 (h), the choice to which the Solicitor referred this morning inactively I may say when he said Brown was given a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.601" offset="20410305">He was not given a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.036" offset="20416052">Under 9 (h), a man was given a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.868" offset="20423471">He could disaffiliate from the Communist Party and remain a union officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.302" offset="20445205">Presumably Congress was giving him that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5113.953" offset="20455758">But here, the Congress has taken away that choice because it has established a five-year period during which he is not to be permitted despite this affiliation from the Communist Party to be a union officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="5652.274" offset="22609084">As long, in other words, as it is then found to be in fact, nothing but a criminal enterprise in and of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5659.331" offset="22637296">Similarly, my client is a member of an officer of a trade union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.802" offset="22655164">I have urged in the brief and have said here earlier today certainly, a man who is a member of a trade union has as much right to the protection of the First Amendment of our Constitution to hold office in that union as he has to be a Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.333" offset="22717231">Now, if that's true how can Congress by taking speech and adding it to speech say that it's going to forbid the man from doing one or other on pain of a surrendering at least one and not even giving him a chance to make the surrender.</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.719" offset="22782851">It's exactly what it amounts to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5697.628" offset="22790478">And I think it's clear that the government has to concede that if this is true, if that's all there it is, speech plus speech remains speech then the statute is dead and should be declared so by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5710.063" offset="22840216">This statute is condemned by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5712.664" offset="22850560">This is why they urged Your Honors to distinguish the statute from the Smith Act cases and others by calling it conduct intertwined with expression of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="5725.733" offset="22902909">And they cite in this Court's recent decision earlier this term Cox against Louisiana which involved a leader of some 2000 people who picketed in or near, near a courthouse and interfered with judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5740.394" offset="22961528">And there this Court held that Louisiana could properly regulate such conduct because it was conduct, it was picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5749.067" offset="22996219">Now, they claim there is an analogy and we say now that we -- we can't -- we ask where is the analogy between Archie Brown sitting down at the executive board meeting of this union with the other 35 members to discuss some union business and the man who leads 2000 pickets of -- near a courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="5771.050" offset="23084199">And Your Honor asked me, do I -- do I consider that injunctions and the proceedings would be different?</text>
            <text syncTime="5775.253" offset="23100918">Yes, certainly because there, he would be receiving an order to show cause and it would be directed toward him and he would have a hearing at which he could offer evidence concerning what he believes, what he stands for, and it would be on the basis of that where a judge would decide whether he should be enjoined in order to keep him away from union meeting.</text>

            <text syncTime="5870.123" offset="23480424">I supposed that we must concede that not only as a matter of philosophy it's desirable that the government -- well, that that government rules best which rules least but also that consistent with our Constitution, there are things which the Congress may not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5888.549" offset="23554194">And the reason they may not do is not because this Court says or anybody else, but because the Constitution which was adopted by the people says so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5898.118" offset="23592438">Now, they make certain arguments that this statute must be treated as though Congress is merely concerned with -- with a special unique position regard to trade unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5913.932" offset="23655654">And they say that unions occupy kind of a unique position in our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5918.441" offset="23673731">Now, as a matter of fact they claim that they even use the expression that unions are vessels of national economic policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5926.693" offset="23706749">We challenge that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5928.546" offset="23714168">We think that the Government of the United States with all deference is the vehicle or vessel or servant of the people of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5938.545" offset="23754083">And that every arm of government in whom power is given and entrusted, it's for the purpose of serving the needs and requirements and desires of the people of the United States and such at least is the form of our government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5952.638" offset="23810508">And it makes no sense at all to say that Congress has some special responsibility in regard to trade unions.</text>

            <text syncTime="6163.832" offset="24655308">It is difficult for me to believe or should this Court accept in the absence of some evidence that no other way lies open than to -- than to pass a law which amounts to amending the First -- Amendments of the Constitution for this reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="6473.559" offset="25894139">I think that is true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6475.699" offset="25902707">I do not understand the argument that 504 is a lesser infringement than 9 (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="6481.890" offset="25927471">And I think that the Solicitor was compelled in fact virtually to abandon that position when in answer to Mr. Justice Goldberg's quotation from the prior brief where the brief pointed out in 9 (h) that criminal punishment at an absolute ban would be more drastic, he had to concede that that was the government's position then.</text>
            <text syncTime="6502.059" offset="26008137">Now, apparently I don't know how he can consider that 504 is a lesser infringement, if it puts a man in jail for holding a union office when 9 (h) did not do so and didn't require him to do anything as a matter of fact, it seems to me that it's turning things upside down to suggest that it's a lesser --</text>

            <text syncTime="6829.350" offset="27317394">It is so far from re -- being a real effort to try to come to grips of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6834.467" offset="27337770">That there's even a provision that it's a crime for a man to work for General Motors as a labor -- labor consultant if he's been a member of the Communist Party in the last five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6843.738" offset="27374864">Now, it of course it doesn't make it a crime for General Motors but it is a crime for somebody to be a labor consultant or employee for various organizations, employer associations that deal with unions.</text>

            <text syncTime="6857.978" offset="27431811">What could there have been to justify something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6860.796" offset="27443096">If General Motors wants to hire somebody who's been a member of the Communist Party maybe precisely because if he has -- he has some expertise about things like that in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="6868.801" offset="27475174">Why he shouldn't have the right to?</text>
            <text syncTime="6869.934" offset="27479667">Not that I -- they haven't hired me to make this argument but it is true that this statute bends it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6876.445" offset="27505685">I submit that under all of the decisions of this Court this statute goes farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="6881.680" offset="27526687">So far as I know that any in the history of the country, it is a dangerous and pernicious type of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6889.475" offset="27557825">It should be declared unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="6893.209" offset="27572767">This Court of Appeals held that it was under the First and Fifth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="6897.149" offset="27588545">I ask, Your Honors, to do the same and in addition to name it for what it is so that proper guidance can be given that it's a biil of attainder and an ex post facto law contrary to the provisions of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="6910.134" offset="27640477">We have vital interest in this country of course.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="6958.764" offset="27835037">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6962.042" offset="27848098">There are just two points that I'd like to deal with very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6966.979" offset="27867847">It has been intimated perhaps I should say during the argument that there might be a question whether this statute could be construed as not applying the Communist Party membership in the broad sense of any knowing membership but narrowed as in the sense of the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6989.992" offset="27959902">I wouldn't say that was impossible, I find two, quite real difficulties with that any such construction that I would like just to mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="6998.830" offset="27995220">One is that was never the construction as I understand it given the Section 9 (h) of the Taft-Hartley Act that it was always assumed to at least cover on -- no membership when you knew you were a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="7011.624" offset="28046420">And this -- the legislative history shows rather plainly was intended as a substitute and I think that I reflect what the legislative history says and not some personal knowledge or impressions I got that everyone assume that the two were coextensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="7029.434" offset="28117682">Second, there is this difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="7034.778" offset="28139102">The Membership Clause of the Smith Act, of course, was concerned directly with membership in an organization intending to overthrow the government by force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="7047.916" offset="28191660">Now, I suppose it's quite possible that what might be a knowing Communist and the intent to manipulate a union through his office in the union to serve Communist purposes without intending to overthrow the government by force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="7067.735" offset="28270864">So that the narrowing would not be directed to the evil with which this statute apparently was directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7075.552" offset="28302106">I think those are things that ought to be taken into account in weighing that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="7081.323" offset="28325198">The other thing to which I'd like to direct myself is to try once again with the risk of reputation to come down to what seems to me to be the truly fundamental interest here, the question here that I can do it best by referring to the argument that there has been no proof of personal guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="7105.318" offset="28421224">There certainly has been proof of personal guilt in the sense that the defendant did the things that the statute forbids.</text>
            <text syncTime="7114.446" offset="28457691">He had a trial on those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7116.566" offset="28466260">He had an opportunity to prove that he didn't do them.</text>
            <text syncTime="7119.523" offset="28478067">The jury found that he did them.</text>
            <text syncTime="7121.249" offset="28484963">Of course, they were hardly controverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="7123.422" offset="28493636">But certainly there was a fair trial in terms of showing the things that the statute forbid.</text>
            <text syncTime="7129.223" offset="28516833">What the -- what can be said is that well, no one was forced to prove that this man intended to abuse his position in the union for the purposes of the Communist party.</text>
            <text syncTime="7145.000" offset="28579944">But I suggest without thinking that this answers the whole case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7149.432" offset="28597708">That nothing in the Fifth Amendment requires proof before you can punish certain things which create a danger of harm that this man will in fact do the harm or to take a -- simple example, I suppose that I can be arrested and prosecuted for driving, if I do it under the influence of intoxicating liquor and it's no defense to say that I drive better under that condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="7177.325" offset="28709198">I equally -- suppose that I owned stock in the civil aeronautics enterprise and became a member of the Civil Aeronautics Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="7189.329" offset="28757264">I couldn't say the government has failed to prove that I'm not the sole of owner who wouldn't possibly be influenced by my stock ownership in the Civil Aeronautics Enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="7201.861" offset="28807419">The question here so that I -- I think really that proof of personal guilt problem isn't it -- the question here is whether the danger in the combining of these two enterprises -- two positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7218.684" offset="28874710">First, whether they have a reasonable relationship to the evil that the Congress was trying to deal with whether there is in fact a reasonable ground to believe that there is arrest that gets over the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7232.339" offset="28929254">Second, whether the evil is great enough to counter balance the indirect restriction upon freedom of association and if it is as we have submit then that gets, it's over the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="7248.391" offset="28993515">But I think those are the issues on which the case must ultimately turn.</text>
