            <text syncTime="12.533" offset="50051">Good morning Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.671" offset="62589">Yesterday, Mr. Justice Brennan made the suggestion by one of his questions that if we are correct with respect to the constitutionality or lack of constitutionality of the Section under which the appellants were convicted, because that statute refers to race, then we really don’t get to the other questions we raised, namely constitutionality of the general anti-miscegenation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.142" offset="164467">So, I'd like to spend my few remaining moments just directing my attention to the statute under which the parties were convicted.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="47.874" stopTime="55.390">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="47.874" offset="191425">Of course, presumably, if the statute under which the appellants were convicted is unconstitutional, so would be the anti-miscegenation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.298" offset="221100">Isn't that correct?</text>

            <label>Mr. William T. Coleman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="55.390" offset="221518">But Mr. Justice Stewart, I would certainly --</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="56.532" stopTime="57.826">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="56.532" offset="226116">The reasoning is right.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_t_coleman_jr" startTime="57.826" stopTime="208.572">
            <label>Mr. William T. Coleman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="57.826" offset="231236">I would certainly say that in a brief where we attacked the anti-miscegenation statute, I think McLaughlin versus Florida would play a prominent part.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.438" offset="273659">As I told you, we've set forth the statute on page 2 of our brief and the statute refers to race in at least three places.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.819" offset="315246">In addition, the charge of the Court and most the trial made it quite clear that, depending upon the races of the party, there would either be a conviction or not a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.660" offset="362580">Now, we think that there's no doubt in this case that the bite of the statute, the guts of the statute, is race.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.463" offset="389851">And therefore, it's directly in conflict with numerous decisions of this Court, all of which have been unanimous on this point that where the state imposes penalties based upon the race of a party, that statute clearly violates the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.712" offset="466756">And, indeed, in the voting case written by Mr. Justice Clark just last term that even though the appellants were not able to show that it made a difference, nevertheless, because that statute referred to race and -- and required the state to designate the race of the party, the Court said the statute was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.602" offset="550348">In this case, we not only have what we had in Anderson but we do have the fact that these people either go to jail or they remain free based solely upon their race.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.046" offset="588173">And we think that certainly the Dorsey case where you had the prohibition against interracial boxing and, certainly, the state could outlaw all boxing and you may have a due process argument, but that is not what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.814" offset="643239">But, because they said that Negroes and Whites could not box, the Court struck that statute down because once again it refers to race and, Mr. Justice Harlan, I think this answers your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.841" offset="687334">And, there, assuming and let's go back to when we both remember in the great second Joe Louis-Billy Con fight, that if the statute had prohibited that fight, Mr. Con would have lost money and Mr. Louis would have lost money.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.125" offset="748460">And, the fact that one was White and one was Negro so they both lost money, nevertheless, would not mean that the Court would still not strike the statute down.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.347" offset="777300">So, I think you have the same thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.807" offset="783151">The fact that one appellant is said to be White, the other is said to be Negro, and they both go to jail doesn't in any way change the rule of this Court that, where the statute refers to race, it's clearly unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.465" offset="985757">Well, we think it's clear and the one thing that this Court's decision, since 1954 and indeed we think 1937, made it clear that where the state inserts race in the statute and -- and the offense or lack of offense depends upon the race of the party, that clearly violates the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.614" offset="1066423">And, we think that that is a question that is just -- ought to be beyond argument at this day in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.378" offset="1093486">But getting back, Mr. Justice Stewart, to the product -- I mean, to the Pace case, as we understand it, there, what the state did was to make a different penalty if the parties were of a different race.</text>

            <text syncTime="589.488" offset="2357917">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.974" offset="2375889">Mr. Justice Harlan, what Mr. Coleman was trying to say is that your timing was exactly perfect because it is exactly to this that I wish to address myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.276" offset="2429074">Mr. Coleman has demonstrated, I think, conclusively that this case can be disposed of if the Court so chooses wholly on the invalidity of Section 798.05 standing alone, as Mr. Justice Brennan's question yesterday implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.765" offset="2507024">But, we -- we propose to argue, and this will be my burden, that the invalidity of that statute under which appellants were convicted is compounded to the extent that the statute incorporates the Florida anti-miscegenation statutes prohibiting marriage between residents of Florida of the different races.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.944" offset="2623739">And, I say the invalidity is compounded, the invalidity of a basic statute is compounded advisably in that -- to emphasize our feeling that however unconstitutional 798.05 is, standing alone, an unequal criminal law it -- a law which prohibits on racial grounds, prohibits the sacrament of marriage to persons of different marital -- races is, if there is such a concept in our law, even more unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.302" offset="2769189">Now, I think -- perhaps I should first say a word as to whether the issue was here because the state has raised some question as to whether the issue is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.475" offset="2809835">Let me say very briefly that, with respect to Florida's contention that the burden of proof is not on the state of showing the non-marriage of defendants in a prosecution under 798.05, the state's contention on this, first of all, is simply inconsistent with the only relevant authority, as Florida practically concedes the Board case discussed in both briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.037" offset="2932088">But, more precisely and I think dispositively, the trial court's instructions in this case are flat at page -- the record at page 93 indicates that the burden is on the state of demonstrating that ingredient of the offense, namely that the defendants are not married.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.315" offset="3009202">That's one of the three ingredients of the offense that the state must prove beyond the exclusion, as the trial judge put it, of every reasonable blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.207" offset="3048803">The -- so -- and, the construction put on the statute by the trial judge in the case which is before this Court, convictions affirmed by the state Supreme Court, I would say are conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.205" offset="3108780">This Court's language in the case referred to yesterday by Mr. Coleman, the decision in Terminiello, 337 U.S. page 1 and page 5, that language is absolutely conclusive on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.184" offset="3168653">So, the burden of proof was on the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.453" offset="3181714">There was evidence in the record, I think it's clear, from which a jury could have concluded that there was a common law marriage, also could have concluded that there was not if the jury had been permitted to reach that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.096" offset="3232287">And, I would particularly refer the Court and then I will leave the factual problems to the testimony at the top of page 30 of the record, the first answer in which the landlady of appellant refers to her husband and her.</text>

            <text syncTime="891.323" offset="3565192">The testimony with respect to marriage to others was also hearsay or ex parte testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.883" offset="3591523">There is no testimony in this record forthcoming from the appellants themselves who were the defendants and who did not take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.865" offset="3619422">So that, all the testimony is of the same hearsay character and our position on this is merely, Mr. Chief Justice, that if a jury were permitted to consider the testimony, it might have come to either position.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.383" offset="3689430">When Mrs. Goodnick says on page 30, speaking of the appellants, “I know he is husband and wife and they pay me the rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.638" offset="3722449">I didn't bother them”, I suggest to this Court that that is evidence from which a jury could have concluded that these were people who held themselves aught to be -- and were thought to be married to one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.483" offset="3777829">But, a jury could have certainly come to the opposite conclusion, I wouldn't begin to challenge it.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.266" offset="3797055">Now, to come -- to reach Mr. Justice Harlan's question, granted that the state have the burden of proving non-marriage and that the issue is here, the state's suggestion that failure to object to the challenge keeps it out of this record is in view of the Terminiello case.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.453" offset="3905724">And, in view of the statutes referred to the Florida statutes, referred to in our reply brief, and I refer to pages 13 through 17 of our reply brief on the question of the state practice, I think that issue is foreclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.892" offset="3987540">Now, Mr. Justice Harlan asks whether there is not merit in the contention that the legislative history of the Civil Rights Bill of 1866 --</text>

            <text syncTime="1022.389" offset="4089522">We submit, if the Court please, that the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment properly understood, reflects no equation between, as Florida has suggested, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, no identity, that is, to be sure it was a purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment to put the 1866 Act on cons -- on a constitutional and unrepealable level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.908" offset="4223582">But, Florida suggests that it was to do no more than that, that the Fourteenth Amendment was limited by the terms and immediate explicit purposes of the 1866 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.311" offset="4277185">I suggest that the -- we have an exact direct test of whether this precise equation can be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.472" offset="4309786">If we look to find whether there are other problems excluded from the ambit of the 1866 Act which have been found by this Court to be within the ambit of the Fourteenth Amendment then, I submit, the asserted equation wholly breaks down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.468" offset="4381780">To make this test, we have quoted in our reply brief from language by the manager of the bill -- the Civil Rights Bill showing that he did not conceive as covering questions of jury service, questions of suffrage, or questions of attendance at schools, all issues are much mooted in the debate, with respect to each of these, it's our elementary jurisprudence that this Court has, for decades, found the juries in Strauder versus West Virginia, suffrage in Nixon versus Hern and in Nixon versus Condon, schools surely before Brown versus Board of Education at least back to Missouri, ex rel. Gaines against Canada, but all of these issues have been found to be within the ambit of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.077" offset="4588251">So that, unless those decisions, all of them, were fundamentally misdecided by this Court, then the position taken by the State of Florida breaks down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.899" offset="4643527">We have taken the liberty of putting in our reply brief extensive excerpts from Mr. Bickel's masterly article on the original understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment, the article published a year following this Court's decision in Brown, because he there examines with a particularity that I know of, and no other source, the assert -- precisely the asserted equation which Florida submits and he -- he takes the full canvas of the legislative history of the Freedmen's Bureau Bill, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and the ultimate Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1290.688" offset="5162736">At the same time, I can't offer to you with any conviction legislative assurance that the other problems which have been judicially determined to come within the ambit of the Amendment were so understood at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.957" offset="5223758">I think Mr. Chief Justice Warren's characterization in the Brown case of the evidence as inconclusive could certainly embrace this issue as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="1366.599" offset="5466384">And at the same time, the radicals could feel that they had an Amendment which, in the fullness of time whether through legislative or through judicial elaboration, would be found to have a more spacious -- a more spacious context.</text>

            <text syncTime="1674.951" offset="6699781">The question is whether the regulations it makes are rational regulations, such as those that deal with consanguinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.131" offset="6736457">Regulations that have a racial dimension are inherently, intrinsically suspects in terms of our fundamental institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.703" offset="6770730">The notion that the federal Constitution controls even the state's paramount interest in matrimony, as I think evident from the fact that -- at each term of Court, this Court in the name of the Full Faith and Credit Clause will -- will intervene with respect to one or another act of state authority in the area of marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.543" offset="6862158">The -- and, I take it that one would not urge that the Full Faith and Credit Clause was a weightier provision of the Constitution in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.535" offset="6902073">I would take it -- that to be true except that the State of Florida, to my astonishment, urges that the Fourteenth Amendment is not a part of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.211" offset="6940839">It remakes an argument flatly rejected by this Court with respect to the submission of the Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.505" offset="6961946">I would say, only to that, that apart from the rather radical consequences of reading the Fourteenth Amendment out of Constitution, Florida's argument would also require this Court to read Amendments One through Ten out of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.784" offset="7019102">And, those Amendments, if you examine the journals of the Senate and the House, were also submitted by Congress by two-thirds of the senators and congressmen present under the guidance of Mr. Madison, not by two-thirds of the -- of the full membership of either chamber.</text>

            <text syncTime="1804.852" offset="7219304">As I think Mr. Coleman put it, the anti-miscegenation statute is even less defensible than a state statute requiring segregation of the schools, in the sense that it imposes -- it -- state power is imposed on two persons, both of whom desire to be married, desire -- of all of personal and present rights enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment, it's surely the most personal and present right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.694" offset="7358694">This Court has held since Meyer versus Nebraska, in 261 U.S., that marriage -- the right to marry and to bring up children is within the Amendment's ambit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.588" offset="7394325">And, in this most personal and intimate of relationships, the state is -- in bringing -- insisting on division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.183" offset="7432673">In the school cases, rightly as obviously I think they were decided, the states could at least urge that there was a countervailing interest of persons who did not want themselves or their children to be integrated in schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.865" offset="7491396">One of this Court's -- the most rigorous critique of this Court's decision in the Brown case, with whom I -- I'm in 97% disagreement, Professor Wechsler distinguishes the school situation from the miscegenation situation in just those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.468" offset="7557851">He finds the case for the -- unconstitutionality of the miscegenation statute much more persuasive because, there, he says, by hypothesis, both parties want the association that the state is barring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.960" offset="7611768">I said I was in 97% difference with Mr. Wechsler only because the 3%, I would agree with is precisely that the anti-miscegenation case, the case now before this Court, is an easier case than the Brown case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.269" offset="7669029">Obviously, I think the Brown case was rightly decided and I think that a decision today by -- by this Court striking down, uprooting -- uprooting, root and branch, the fabric of the miscegenation laws which cover some-19 states still though, the tendency has been to repeal, such a decision will, in the fullness of time, accomplish what surely was a purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment, to write the Dred Scott decision out of our laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.791" offset="7799118">There, this Court said, “Speaking of the anti-miscegenation laws, this stigma of the deepest degradation was fixed upon the whole race”.</text>

            <text syncTime="1979.691" offset="7918759">Good morning Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.711" offset="7926805">I'm James Mahorner, Assistant Attorney General, will represent the appellee, State of Florida, in this cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.872" offset="7955435">I would first, just to wind up, I'd liked to briefly touch on the facts with the observation that, though it was hearsay evidence for the proposition that these defendants were married to each -- to other people and if they were not married to each other and that they were Negro and White respectively, that all such hearsay evidence was in the form of admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.162" offset="8048640">While as far as the hearsay evidence concerning their being married to each other, it was hearsay evidence relating to the representation of one party which bore no admission exception to the hearsay rule and is not material evidence in this cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.244" offset="8116976">And, therefore, we have for the purpose of this record before this Court ample evidence, legal in nature, that these parties were not married and we have not one iota of evidence when we consider, limited by the rules of law, as to what constitutes evidence, not one iota of evidence that these parties were married to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.230" offset="8224914">So, with that distinguishing feature and with the realization that the Court can well review the evidence that we cite, show -- to show the proposition that these Negroes were -- these parties were Negro and White and that they were not married to each other, according to what was the evidence has shown, I will proceed into the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.732" offset="8314880">The case is before this Court on three propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.404" offset="8329613">The one we will take first, and I'll give them in the order that we will give in the brief, is first, the interracial marriage, the constitutionality of the Florida Constitution provision which prohibits interracial marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.911" offset="8391576">The second is to do with discriminatory co -- aspects of Section 798.05, Florida statutes under which the accused were prosecuted which prohibited cohabitation between Negro and White couples who were not married.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.822" offset="8467226">And, the third is the concept of the statute 798.05 is unconstitutional because it's ambiguous and it has used the term “Negro”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.435" offset="8505678">Now, first, to take the first one, the one that we conceive of as most important in this case, and that is the question of whether Article 16 Section 24 of the Florida Constitution which prohibits -- which prohibits interracial marriage violates the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2315.734" offset="9262916">And so, our burden would be to show as a manner of law that in this area, we didn't have to prove at all that they carried the burden and the amount of evidence that the state actually put on only has emotional aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.486" offset="9317878">As far as the actual legal question, if the state was under the burden to proof, then the jury -- they had the right to have a jury to decide and, if the state was not under the burden, then they had to put on some evidence to carry their burden and there is no legal evidence in this record which could possibly sustain any burden of proving that they were married because none of the evidence, even if all that was believed, would show that they were married.</text>

            <text syncTime="2357.628" offset="9430413">Yes, sir, and I am citing multiple cases for that proposition and I will go -- yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.694" offset="9458730">Now, our first approach was the background to the federal constitution beginning with the introduction of Freedmen's Bureau Bill in January of 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.762" offset="9519020">And, we show there that this bill which guaranteed the same civil rights to Negroes that White people had at that time, that during the debates of this Bill, the question came up -- the question came up before all considering as to whether this Bill would prohibit state -- the enactment of state anti-miscegenation provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.825" offset="9623197">And, the conclusion was that it would not so prohibit and the rationale given was the same rationale recognized by this Court in Pace v. Alabama to whit that there was no discrimination because both parties stood equal and they were equally prohibited from engaging in this particular enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.644" offset="9722567">Then, approximately April 1866, the Civil Rights Bill came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.844" offset="9747331">And, surrounding that Bill was the same -- same argument and the same conclusion reached that it was not touched state anti-miscegenation statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.049" offset="9796127">And then, the same people, in June of 1866, just a few months later, and it proposed the Fourteenth Amendment -- it proposed the Fourteenth Amendment and they said, as we pointed out in our brief, the multiple statements before the whole group say that purpose of this Bill was to place the Civil Rights Bill into the constitution so that it could not be repealed by just the majority and that it was, in effect, just the first provision the con -- of the constitutional provision, Section 1, was in effect identical to the Civil Rights provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.008" offset="9947951">These were the observations given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.481" offset="9953907">These were the observations set out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.495" offset="9965923">Now, we submit that it was not the intent, that the Fourteenth Amendment was not the intent -- proposing the Fourteenth Amendment, that such Amendment would prohibit state anti-miscegenation laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.510" offset="10017959">Now, they have come forth with the idea -- well, this argument was thrown aside with Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.513" offset="10038021">But, we can distinguish Brown and Brown itself well sets out how it's distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.906" offset="10059546">The rationale of Brown makes its own distinguishing feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.753" offset="10070936">That rationale is that education has developed and it is no longer like it was then, and the intent then applied to something that is no longer even in existence today because it has so changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.312" offset="10105208">And, the intent then is not controlling when the Fourteenth Amendment was passed because education has developed to such a place where it is no longer the same beast and the intent to control it -- that was controlling it to the former beast is no longer controlling as to this newborn beast, but what about marriage?</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.417" offset="10197577">There has been no development in marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.387" offset="10209489">There has been no development in marriage and be comparable to education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.043" offset="10224118">There has been no development at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.636" offset="10230491">It is the same institution, and the intent that was controlling then must control now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.838" offset="10255256">And, if we are to give the legislature the right of way in this area and recognize that intent, that intent which was then should be given recognition today and it does not matter what we ourselves, as members of a judiciary or Bar, believe should be done in the legislative branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.189" offset="10332682">The thing is that they didn't intend that that be done, and it wasn't done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.104" offset="10352327">And, we submit that this is not ruled by the educational cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.103" offset="10376359">Now, they have brought in the general cases to do with prohibitions of boxing, the prohibitions to golf matches where the prohibition was to prohibit Whites and Negroes from engaging together in this particular sport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.254" offset="10452950">But in each of those cases, that was under the Brown decision going to separate facilities are inherently unequal, and please, I hope I can get this analogy clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.327" offset="10517211">In Brown, the statute prohibited, they're attending the same schools but it could have prohibited them from studying together and have had the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.438" offset="10557649">By prohibiting them from studying together, it would have resulted in there having separate facility at the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.225" offset="10588891">Under these athletic cases where they are prohibited from going into golf matches in city courses together, it wasn't limited to city courses but it concern city courses, the effect is -- where they were prohibited from boxing together under a state organized boxing games, state facilities in the boxing, the idea was that the effect of that was to cause the facilities to be separate just like, if under the Brown decision, the statute had prohibited them from studying together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.877" offset="10707487">They would not have made any difference in the decision but, what about marriage?</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.579" offset="10726296">The rationale is not applicable there because, with interracial marriage, there is no separate facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.718" offset="10750851">It is the same facility denied to each.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.254" offset="10764957">It's the same facility denied to each.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.987" offset="10775928">Now, they say that the idea of voting was guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.341" offset="10813336">We know the Fifteenth was brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.525" offset="10822008">Now, as far as the Fourteenth application, it has been given -- it's been deemed by this Court to give equal rights of voting, but the arguments given by Howard of Michigan did not say it didn't give equal rights of voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.386" offset="10877492">It just said it didn't guarantee voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.937" offset="10887732">The voting was said to be guaranteed by the Fifteenth which was found necessary to be enacted later because the Fourteenth didn't guarantee this right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3603.587" offset="14414263">But, the weakness in that argument is that they were not attacking the statute concerned in the instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.936" offset="14439654">They were attacking a statute that had nothing to do with anti-miscegenation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.255" offset="14456999">And therefore, the (Inaudible) exception to the requirement of the instruction is not applicable here because these people were not attacking the uncon -- the miscegenation statutes of Florida as unconstitutional in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.490" offset="14509871">And, this instruction was to a collateral aspect and was not directly raised by a motion to quash which attacked directly 798.05, which was not concerned in the instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.374" offset="14553443">So, there is no ground to overlook the fact that they made no objection to this instruction and Section 918.10 Florida statute sets out the Court should not consider as instruct -- the question of whether the instruction is erroneous, should not consider on appeal whether it is erroneous -- the question is whether is erroneous if there was no objection made to it, and the exception is not applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.371" offset="14653440">Now, furthermore, Florida does not reverse cases just for error, they reversed only if the error was harmful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.819" offset="14687190">Now, let's assume for the moment that the instruction was erroneous and it deprives them of the defense of a common law marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.859" offset="14723344">Well, that was only harmful if they were entitled to that defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.326" offset="14741211">And if the burden was on them to prove it, then -- and they did not prove it, they were not entitled to that defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.915" offset="14775589">And the -- we have submitted at least five cases on the proposition, one from this Court concerning a prosecution for an unregistered still and the Court held that the federal government did not have to prove that the still was unregistered, that the burden was on the defendant to show that it was registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.983" offset="14867853">And then, we go into cases just about squarely on point, and that's Pace v. U.S. which concerned -- concern a prosecution under the Mann Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.020" offset="14912052">And in that case, defendant was prosecuted for taking a woman across state lines for immoral purposes to which -- to pay her to engage in sexual intercourse with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.352" offset="14953326">And when it came up on appeal, the question was presented, there was no proof that these parties were married -- were not -- were not married and that if they had been married, the conduct would not have been immoral and that it was on -- the burden was on the prosecution to prove the immorality of the conduct, and they had not done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.385" offset="15041515">And this federal court answered, the Circuit Court of Appeals answered that the burden in a case involving a defensive marriage is on the defendants because they have peculiar knowledge as to whether a marriage exist and it is impossible for the prosecution -- impossible for the prosecution itself to prove that these people have never married anywhere in the world at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.083" offset="15160320">And, this same concept is recognized by no lesser work than CJS 53 lewdness -- 53 CJS involving lewdness in Section 5, and the same principle is set forth there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.131" offset="15208490">And this isn't an unusual principle.It is a well recognized principle, and if -- if the burden was on them to prove it, then the state was entitled to this instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.660" offset="15254570">They were entitled to an instruction that the burden was on the defendants and they were entitled to an instruction that as a manner of law, no proof have been given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.807" offset="15291141">And, the defense would have been deprived of this defense of marriage by that set of instructions, and what harm is it that they were deprived for the same defense that they could have been correct -- could have been deprived for, for a correct reason when they were deprived of it, for the purpose of argument, for an erroneous reason we'll assume, to with the validity of Florida miscegenation provisions or the application of Florida miscegenation provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.020" offset="15388003">And so we submit that under that rationale, the case is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.165" offset="15404617">It's not before the Court because they are to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.168" offset="15420604">And, we would like to emphasize first, before we go on, that these defendants should not be permitted to use this case as a general fantasy of what they conceive of the social wrongs or a vehicle that attack everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.118" offset="15476402">If the statute on which they're prosecuted was unconstitutional, our argument with the defendants has ceased and they are with it, and there is no real issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.426" offset="15521646">Our argument is ceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="3881.764" offset="15526975">They'd have their remedy and there is no issue between the defendants and the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.423" offset="15549649">If the Court -- if the Court would have to go on and keep the case into effect to reach this, then we submit that only one issue should be reached in this case, one or two but we -- if they determine that the statute is unconstitutional under which these people were prosecuted, the question of miscegenation would arise.</text>

            <text syncTime="3992.470" offset="15969802">Supposing your premise is accepted namely, that because of this legislative history, miscegenation statutes were excluded from the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment so that a miscegenation statute, so far as the federal Constitution is concerned, it would be within the power of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.794" offset="16063112">Why wouldn't it follow a fortiori that the state had power equally to apply racial considerations to an elicit relationship or a relationship of this kind where the parties weren't married?</text>

            <text syncTime="4073.557" offset="16294139">And I think -- I think it's an excellent argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.014" offset="16308036">I think the better rationale is that if the stat -- the Section 14 of the federal Constitution did not mean to prohibit miscegenation, it was their intent that those statutes could go ahead, I think it's excellent to say that they -- I mean, it's an -- that you can reasonably transfer that over and say that they did not mean to interfere with these statutes that prohibited specific conduct between Negro and White.</text>

            <text syncTime="4252.875" offset="17011461">Now, to the distinguishment between 798.05 and 798.02 has taken the proposition that there is an invidious discrimination here in these two statutes, between 798.05 and 798.02.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.940" offset="17091709">Section 798.02 -- 798.02 prohibits -- prohibits lascivious cohabitation in general and provides for a two-year maximum sentence, and it's a felony and it would be applicable to White-White and Black-Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.519" offset="17178018">Section 798.05 prohibits cohabitation between Negro and White couples and provides a maximum sentence of one year.</text>

            <text syncTime="4329.542" offset="17318139">798.02 prevents it, as held by the Courts, by prohibiting punishment -- by punishing acts involving living together and having intercourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.879" offset="17363487">Section 798.05 apparently punishes just living together in the very same room.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.964" offset="17403820">The Court -- we submit that there is -- as set out by Williamson versus Optical Company where they said that this discrimination must be invidious.</text>

            <text syncTime="4368.722" offset="17474873">There is no invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.994" offset="17483964">There is discrimination, we admit, but one group has lesser sins, the other group has greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.390" offset="17509460">That's one element, but the idea is to prohibit the same results and they have taken a mildly different approach and we submit the difference is not invidious, especially as applicable to these defendants where they receive a very light jail sentence 30 days, I believe, and a $250-fine with $24-Court cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="4400.152" offset="17600575">Now, the next is a question of ambiguity and I'll touch lightly on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.070" offset="17632235">We have taken the position that there are multiple cases interpreting Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="4413.326" offset="17653238">You go to words and phrases, you will see many cases interpreting that term and saying that it has a well-understood meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4420.689" offset="17682704">And, we submit that, where Florida has set it out by 1.01 with mathematical definiteness that certainly Florida should be not -- it should not be found to be at fault for ambiguity when cases, whether it set out no definition, have been found does not have the constitutional infirmity of ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.179" offset="17756682">We further submit that they abandoned this argument in Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.196" offset="17768699">We gave you copy of their brief to verify it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.814" offset="17779252">Section 3.71 of the Florida Supreme Court Rules provide -- specifically provides that where you fail to argue in your brief, you have abandoned the assignment of error and that's set out by cases cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.893" offset="17831497">Now the last point doing with the Fourteenth Amendment, that is put in for one main purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4464.138" offset="17856470">It's to show the Court the effect of setting aside or an attack of long-established things we possibly have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4472.217" offset="17888862">If we were to set aside the Fourteenth Amendment, we would do away with a multiplicity of cases and change a lot of rights that have the general appearance that being vested at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4484.426" offset="17937659">If we threw away with this Florida constitutional provision, we likewise, do a wide variety of things.</text>

            <text syncTime="4684.016" offset="18735961">Well, as far as the state itself is concerned -- I mean, like with the Fourteenth, if we set it aside, you might argue “Well, it won't touch anybody involved outside the country”, and that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.148" offset="18784549">And, as we set this Florida miscegenation statute, it won't involve acts done outside the state, but it never did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.816" offset="18807223">And in interpreting the Fourteenth, you never applied it to acts outside the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4705.289" offset="18821120">And, interpreting our constitutional provision, we never applied it to acts outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.583" offset="18842331">And therefore, as far as setting aside the Fourteenth, it won't affect far -- decisions outside the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4717.186" offset="18868663">And we're setting aside this one -- affect far-reaching decisions outside the state, but the things is we've always been consistent there and the things that have been vested have been vested in light of that -- had been vested in light of that with the knowledge that if it was done outside the state, it was okay and if it was done inside the state, it was not okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4735.360" offset="18941388">Now, I would like to submit one thing to the Court that I would -- I would not think it untoward to comment on it in the opinion, and that is that after the Civil War, the Thirteenth Amendment was adopted by all the states, whether they were southern or northern, and the states were considered in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.552" offset="19026129">And then, for purposes of proposing the Fourteenth Amendment, the states were denied their state senate seats -- or their federal senate seats, and their federal legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.359" offset="19061342">And, I think something should be put forth which will prevent a precedent that 10 years from now, if the body across the street gets angry or so forth and so on, that 51% of the members over there cannot count the 49%, that is the minority, and then propose a constitutional Amendment by two-thirds vote, the contents of which could be so favorable to the state such as to take away all power from the federal courts and put them in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4786.596" offset="19146292">The contents of which would be so favorable -- it could be so favorable to the states whether it'd be school, prayer, or what have you that they would quickly ratify and the only protection against such an unwarranted act is the requirement of two-thirds over here and that 51% cannot put out the other 49%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.481" offset="19245871">And that's what was done in passing the Fourteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.993" offset="19255902">The greater percent put out lesser percent and it was then proposed by the minority -- the group left and we should have some way of distinguishing that Act from a later precedent, the same thing can be done again.</text>

            <text syncTime="5193.654" offset="20774557">Now, I understand this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.454" offset="20785737">It could well be argued that they should advocate interracial marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5202.590" offset="20810292">There may be something supporting that, but we don't determine here ‘what is the wisest thing', the idea is if there's something a fairer reason to infer the possibility of fact existing to sustain this legislation, then such facts must be presumed until the record reflects that they are not there, and this record does not so reflect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5228.667" offset="20914573">Now, you've held that in several cases, the idea that -- well, one was Borden Products Company -- Borden's Products Incorporated versus Borden.</text>
            <text syncTime="5243.825" offset="20975282">But, the idea is that until the facts that could be there, show not to be there by the record, then the legislation should be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="5254.106" offset="21016346">I'm not arguing that later, in the next case, that they not -- may not put on ample evidence to show that, psychologically, the grasping out to the grandchild doesn't apply whatsoever that you love a colored child just as much, that you identify with just as much, and that the colored grandparent loves the White child just as much and identifies with them just as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="5277.056" offset="21108193">They might well show that later but, if they don't show that or if there's a reasonable assumption from the total evidence that it's to the contrary, then there's a clear legislative purpose in the state as a legal greater parent and -- heaven knows under our law it is, they can take from the natural parent very quickly, the legal greater parent from -- to protect these offspring and it has nothing to do with inferiority.</text>

            <text syncTime="5331.832" offset="21327308">I would just like to say in the way of philosophy that there has been a change today in the world, and that change is in physical sciences and there's been a vast improvement in their knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="5345.696" offset="21382687">And, today, we have great potential one to destroy the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="5349.957" offset="21399824">And eventually, it won't be limited to country.It will be possessed by the Forbes and the Rockefellers and people who would generally have intelligence, enough intelligence to understand well -- understand social concepts as well as financial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5367.669" offset="21470668">And today, we have several times than on the brink and the reason we've been on the brink is not because of the advancement of physical sciences.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.673" offset="21506612">It's because the unbalanced cause by the lag of the social sciences and the duty of the social sciences is to give us such strong scientific rules of law or rules of personal relations that we can live together even though there's been such an upswing in the physical science area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5395.579" offset="21582263">And we think that this decision should come from a straight logical concept and we will readily concede that there's much logic against us, much.</text>
            <text syncTime="5405.442" offset="21621760">I do not think the strongest point against us is necessarily the idea of a mother being prohibited from living with its child since we recognized the marriage, I think that could be well a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.287" offset="21661048">But there are strong points against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5417.988" offset="21671915">But, if the logic is in our favor regardless of the social desirability, we must have the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5424.385" offset="21697515">We have -- we feel that there is a duty to offset any lag if we are to continue into existence, and there must be opinion after opinion from the Bar, the judiciary, and who have you setting up a strong social concept as equally scientific to that we see physically.</text>

            <text syncTime="5453.998" offset="21815902">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5455.323" offset="21821231">I thought I was in 1964, but for the last 10 minutes, I've almost been trembling because I haven't heard such come from a governmental body since Hitler used to make speeches indicating about the superiority of one race or justifying why Jews and Gentiles could not associate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5478.219" offset="21912869">I think this -- this statement reaffirms the judgment of this Court that separate but equal cannot exist in a democratic society.</text>
            <text syncTime="5489.983" offset="21959889">Certainly, to say that the justification for this law is that people in Florida want to be able to live presumably with a Negro woman but then, when they want to walk away, they want to be able to walk away, not give her property, not go through a divorce and yet be able to marry someone else, and that's the justification for this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5518.902" offset="22075559">I'd like to say that since we have referred to or my friend has referred to Justice Harlan, the Elder or the former Justice Harlan, I think that we will rely upon his statement that the Constitution is colorblind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5535.565" offset="22142224">Now, with respect to the question of proof of the marriage in the record, if you will turn to page 82 and 83, you will find the only evidence in the record that the state could use or rely upon to show that the parties had been married previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.561" offset="22234175">Now, with respect to the woman appellate, the sole evidence is that at one time, she was known as Connie Gonzales and another time as Connie Hoffman.</text>
            <text syncTime="5572.739" offset="22290913">And in each case, she was asked by the person that mainly testify, “Were you” -- testified, “Were you legally married to these persons?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5580.568" offset="22322260">And she said, “No”, that's the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5585.093" offset="22340336">And as my friend said, apparently in Florida -- apparently they play a game of being associated with someone and you walk away because you're not legally married.</text>
            <text syncTime="5593.149" offset="22372519">Now -- and also, with respect to Dewey McLaughlin, the sole evidence is on page 82 where he was asked in 1961 whether he was married, single, separated, divorced, or a widower and he said separated, and I asked for the name of his wife and he said Willie Mae McLaughlin and he did not know her address.</text>
            <text syncTime="5616.948" offset="22467709">Now, this is in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="5618.541" offset="22474083">Certainly, almost in -- almost every state in the union within a year, you can go through a formal divorce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5624.316" offset="22497176">The state did not prove that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5626.399" offset="22505535">Now, I'd like to spend the rest of my time meeting the one argument which I think the state advanced and we should spend some time with, and that is the argument with respect to the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5639.172" offset="22556630">As I understand the argument, the argument asked that under the Civil Rights Act of 1866, certain things were included, certain things were excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="5653.263" offset="22612950">Then thereafter, there was a judgment made to put the Fourteenth Amendment so as to protect what was in the Act of 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.866" offset="22655373">And he says that because he can point to a legislative history in the Act of 1866 that miscegenation was not covered or anti-miscegenation statute, that ergo it couldn't be within the range or the reach of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5680.944" offset="22723709">I think you first should understand and realize when you examine his brief that he does not -- the state does not -- any place, and I repeat, any place point to any legislation with respect to the Fourteenth Amendment which says that the issue of anti-miscegenation was discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5702.088" offset="22808346">So, the -- all the legislative history is in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5705.544" offset="22822139">So, it seems to me that his first burden is to explain in a way the fact that in the Fourteenth Amendment debate, there's no such discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5712.843" offset="22851291">I think that's conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5714.481" offset="22857874">Secondly, as I understand his argument, he says, “Well, education wasn't discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5720.738" offset="22882952">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="5721.670" offset="22886609">Because education at that time wasn't developed, but it got developed afterwards, therefore the Congress did not think about that”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5734.490" offset="22937913">Well, I happen to be involved in the 1954 decision and our friends on the other side gave us a lot of legislative history saying that schools were discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5746.631" offset="22986501">So, I don't think, when you start at the first part that you can say that the legislation was a -- the legislative history was absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5755.036" offset="23020042">But more important, it seems to me the thrust of his argument is that if the item was fully developed at the time when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, then you have to be able to look in the legislative history and see what the resolution was, and the only -- in those things which were not fully developed, can you have the right now to determine what the Fourteenth Amendment should've mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="5780.295" offset="23121084">But, it seems to me that ever since Runney Mead in 1215, or whenever Runney Mead was and I'm pretty sure you could recall the date, that trial by jury existed and trial by jury I think predates public education and it probably predates anti-miscegenation as far as Whites with African Negroes are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5802.095" offset="23208333">And it's clear that in the 1866 Act, Congress did not talk about juries and juries were not included, but nevertheless, we do know that the Court has determined that the Equal Protection Clause applies to jury selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5817.533" offset="23270087">Secondly, I've read and heard about Rottenburg in England long before the Act of 1866, but yet we know just this last term, the Court met the issue on reapportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5831.729" offset="23326824">And I could go down and indicate a lot of things where they were developed much more in education in that particular problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5838.844" offset="23355350">I also like to point out to the Court that as we understand the Fourteenth Amendment, when it was adopted, the country thought it pretty -- it meant pretty much what we think it means today but what happened, as a result of the compromise of 1877, that there was a drawing back on the Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5860.744" offset="23442913">And I'd like to call the Court's attention to the case of Burns versus State which was decided in 1872, which is cited in our brief, by the Supreme Court of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="5871.624" offset="23486485">And in 1872, the Supreme Court of Alabama had no trouble with -- when reading the Act of 1866 and also reading the Fourteenth Amendment to hold and to hold clearly that anti-miscegenation statutes were unconstitutional and it was only because of this Court's earlier decision which developed this doctrine of ‘separate but equal' which we all know now was not -- can no longer endure, that the states began to get the sophistication that perhaps we could save these laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5904.119" offset="23616470">But I would suggest to you that you read this decision and you will find that the Supreme Court of Alabama had no difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5910.838" offset="23643324">Now just one detail in the record, Mr. Justice Goldberg, when you asked about Dewey McLaughlin, he -- on page 56, it says he was born in Honduras and if my geography is correct, I think that's in Central America.</text>
            <text syncTime="5929.021" offset="23716049">And in closing, I would like to state as we started, that we think the decisions of this Court make it clear that any statute which mentions the word “race” and on that basis gives or withholds rights to American citizens is clearly unconstitutionally -- unconstitutional and that's basically what this case is about, whether you approach the statute under which these people were convicted or the anti-miscegenation statute.</text>
