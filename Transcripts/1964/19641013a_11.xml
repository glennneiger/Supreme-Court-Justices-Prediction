            <text syncTime="20.765" offset="82965">Good afternoon Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.004" offset="99997">The basic issue in this appeal is whether in a country committed the equality concept as it -- as inviting in the Fourteenth Amendment to the constitution of the United States, a state, one, can make certain conduct illegal and criminal exclusively and solely because persons of different races are involved, or two, can deny citizens the right to marry each other exclusively and solely because they are of different races.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.705" offset="230818">The case is here on appeal at every stage in the proceeding, the appellants' attack the constitutionality on federal grounds of the statute of which they stand convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.561" offset="286198">The relevant facts are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.635" offset="298527">On March 1, 1962, appellants described in the information which appears on page 3 of the record as Connie Hoffman and Dewey McLaughlin were charged with violation of Section 798.05 of the Florida statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.381" offset="401450">This statute, which is found on page 2 of our brief provides any Negro man and White woman or any White man and Negro woman who are not married to each other who shall habitually live in and occupy in the night time the same room shall be punished by imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or by fine not ex -- not exceeding $500.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.692" offset="530704">The information alleged that the person described in the information as Connie Hoffman being a White woman, and Dewey McLaughlin being a Negro man who are not married to each other that habitually live in and occupy in the night time the same room.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.289" offset="597055">The appellants entered the plea of not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.732" offset="610847">They filed a motion to quash the information which motion appears on page 5 of the record, and in this motion, they attack the constitutionality of 798.05 on the ground that it violated the federal constitution because of vagueness that it denied them equal protection of law and invaded their right to privacy.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="175.067" offset="700186">Strongly there's no cohabitation in the statute that applies to people of the same race?</text>

            <text syncTime="179.370" offset="717427">Sir I make the -- sir, I make the firm statement that in first place, the statute is not a cohabitation statute, if you mean by cohabitation that there has to be sexual intercourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.992" offset="767896">I make the firm statement that -- that there is no statute in Florida which would punish this conduct if done by two White persons with different sexes or two Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.848" offset="823380">And I thought that we would spend some time in the brief pointing out the Florida statutes, but sir, I think I'm relieved to that obligation because if you will turn to page 55 of the state's brief which is a brief for the appellee, you will see where they say and they recognize that the statute that we're under, 798.05, does not require proof that sexual intercourse took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.279" offset="945110">And the only statute that the state can come near to pointing out that maybe there is a similar crime of people who are involved of the same race is 798.02 where they admit and concede that under that statute, the state must show and has to show as a matter of its proof that sexual intercourse took place.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="257.577" offset="1030269">-- this is the so called fornication?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_t_coleman_jr" startTime="259.326" stopTime="458.273">
            <label>Mr. William T. Coleman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="259.326" offset="1037270">No sir, this is called the lewd and cohabitation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.789" offset="1055138">Under the fornication statute, I think every state that has one in the union clearly requires proof of sexual intercourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.866" offset="1083455">This statute -- and let's make this clear only for the argument that this statute does not require any proof of sexual intercourse and that issue was not submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.468" offset="1121802">In fact, I think at this stage just to wrap this point up Your Honor, I'd like to call your attention to the charge which appears on page -- starting on page 92 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.178" offset="1220650">And at page 93 at the bottom of the last four paragraph where the judge says “I instruct you that the elements of the crime -- charge in this case and which must be proved to you beyond -- and beyond the exclusion of every reasonable blood” and I'm pretty sure he means doubt “are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.094" offset="1304346">That one defendant in this case has at least 1/8 Negro blood and that the other defendant has more than 7/8 White blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.265" offset="1337051">Two that defendants have habitually or did habitually live in and occupied the same room during the night time and three, that defendants were not married to each other at the time of the alleged offense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="345.691" offset="1382713">You will note there's no charge that you have to prove that sexual intercourse took play and we cite cases in our brief on page 10 and 12 which clearly establish that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.564" offset="1426181">So here, you have a case where solely because the parties are of different race, they can go to jail and be sentenced with the same thing that if they had been of the same race, they could not have been punished for.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.556" offset="1490129">As I pointed out to sir, not only did we attack the statute by filing a motion attacking the information, but immediately after the case had been called for trial but before any witnesses were put on, the same constitutional issues were raised and the court there rejected them on the ground that have been raised and passed upon by another judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.642" offset="1590544">That appears on page 18 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.442" offset="1605695">Now, as I've told you, there were three things that the state had to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.217" offset="1628787">Now the evidence with respect to the first one, namely that they lived in the same room together or they occupy the same room was testimony that on several occasion, Dewey McLaughlin was seen in the apartment rented to the woman, appellant, and that he was seen there as late as 11 o'clock at night and as early as 7:30 in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.239" offset="1724918">Now that's basically the testimony on that and we don't challenge that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.931" offset="1743621">Now with respect to the marriage or lack of marriage, and when I developed my argument, you will find that the state has determined that the existence of a marriage is part of the offense and the state has the burden of proving that a marriage did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.754" offset="1810913">Now the testimony on marriage is in conflict and it was --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="458.273" stopTime="462.434">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="458.273" offset="1833064">-- in other words, one of the ingredients is the state's burden of proof that there was no marriage?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_t_coleman_jr" startTime="462.434" stopTime="582.210">
            <label>Mr. William T. Coleman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="462.434" offset="1849678">Yes sir, there's a case which so holds that the state has the burden of proving that there was no marriage, and we cite that case in our brief Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.790" offset="1883115">Now the testimony in all of this came out of the witnesses produced by the state, was that the two appellants had held themselves out as being husband and wife and they referred to on many occasions as husband and wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.160" offset="1944555">The state, however, sought to prove that a marriage did not exist, relying upon testimony that when the male appellant applied in 1961 which was two years -- which was a year before the offense, had stated when asked his marital status that he was separated from a person named Willy McLaughlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.131" offset="2044447">And also with respect to the woman appellant, the state attempted to show that at different times in her life, as one time she went by the name of Gonzales and then she went by the name of Hoffman.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.097" offset="2092304">Now with respect to the marriage or non-marriage, our position on that is that perhaps a jury could've found either way that there was a marriage or there was not a marriage although I don't think the testimony is really that clear but we don't have that problem because the judge, when he turned to that issue, took that issue out of the case because he instructed on page 94 that in the State of Florida that if the facts took place in Florida, which you may rely upon to prove a common law marriage, that if the parties were of different races, they couldn't enter into a common law marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.231" offset="2276833">There's a Florida constitution provision which prevents that and there are two Florida statutes and I think there's a third one that will put the minister in jail that would perform that type of ceremony.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.779" offset="2315076">So therefore the issue was taken away from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.655" offset="2326570">Now the constitution --</text>

            <text syncTime="854.006" offset="3415980">That there you have a Florida statute which says -- has this provision of 1/8 which because you use mathematics, you just assume that it must be definite.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.790" offset="3451089">But then just read what the judge said because once you had the 1/8 problem of the blood and the lawyer pointed out where you can't prove who has Negro blood and who doesn't have Negro blood, the judge is “Oh, the statute can't mean that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="875.410" offset="3501558">And then he moves to say “Well it must mean ancestors?”</text>
            <text syncTime="877.794" offset="3511171">Then they said “There's no proof of ancestors in the record.”</text>
            <text syncTime="880.251" offset="3520993">He says “Well it really doesn't mean that.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.955" offset="3527784">What it really must mean is that somebody can go on the stand and testify as to the race of the party in his judgment and that's all the state has to do.”</text>
            <text syncTime="890.438" offset="3561744">Now the person to testify as respect to the race says “I'm no expert in this but in my judgment one looks like White and the other Negro.”</text>
            <text syncTime="897.735" offset="3590896">So I do think you also have the issue of vagueness, or if the statute isn't vague, you have the issue that the -- there's no proof.</text>
