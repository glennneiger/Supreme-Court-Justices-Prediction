            <text syncTime="24.032" offset="96026">At the time of recess yesterday afternoon, I believe I had started my discussion of the three criteria of legitimacy which we feel is established by a survey of relevant decisions of State Courts throughout the country for determining whether a venue change motion or a motion for judicial disqualification can be held to be contemptuous on the one hand or whether it is perfectly legitimate on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.479" offset="233848">These criteria elaborated in our brief are that such a motion must be relevant, its contents must be relevant, it must be presented in good faith, and it must be presented in respectful language and in a respectful manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.246" offset="304901">We urge that the record indicates that all of these criteria were amply met.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.014" offset="331964">It appears that the Virginia Supreme Court gave some attention to some of these criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.535" offset="362057">They seem to agree that relevancy or as they put it pertinence is important, but they conclude that this criteria was not met.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.025" offset="404062">Without elaboration, we suggest that the material we have set forth in the -- the material set forth in the record digested in our brief on page 14 and 15, amply demonstrates, establishes beyond any reasonable doubt that the contents of this motion were relevant to the relief being sought.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.444" offset="1205708">The way we read the cases Mr. Justice Brennan, these are co-relative rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.969" offset="1223784">That the -- whatever right the client has to have an effective diligence zealous advocate, the lawyer's calling -- the lawyer's professional responsibility gives him the co-relative right to advocate to the best of his ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.229" offset="1288882">I believe that some decisions have referred to this as the lawyer's right of free speech, the lawyer's right of advocacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.770" offset="1443004">The Virginia Supreme Court states that the absence of a compulsory disqualification statute itself amounts to bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.116" offset="1472366">Now, this seems to us to be almost a classical non-sequitur, because it's stating that a mistaken law amounts to bad faith which of course is something which is (Inaudible) and not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.243" offset="1520953">Conceivably the defendants may have been wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.661" offset="1530567">We will never know because there was not a hearing or at least we do not know at this point, but certainly the charge that they are on in bad faith is something which is completely unsupported.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.253" offset="1568914">Similarly with regard to the element of respect, there is nothing in the record which indicates that anything transpired on this proceeding before Judge Holladay other than the reading of the motion which had been previously filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="897.002" offset="3587971">Mr. Dawley had represented an organization in and about the Hopewell area which had been sued by Hopewell Newspapers for a slander charge in which they brought a civil action.</text>

            <text syncTime="988.376" offset="3953476">The Court gave him time to consider and he came back on October the 10th or 11th, it's not quite clear which of those dates he came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.328" offset="3981270">At that time, he was represented.</text>

            <text syncTime="1000.795" offset="4003109">Mr. Holt, at that time, asked for a time to consider again or to take time to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.172" offset="4028604">Thereafter, the Court issued a Rule, setting this case for January the 8th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.067" offset="4060264">Now, there were a lot of proceedings that took place in the meantime, because its counsel immediately went to work to try to get out of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.228" offset="4092865">In other words, they didn't want the show cause order return to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.551" offset="4110106">So on December 11th then, you had the date set for Mr. Dawley to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.782" offset="4131109">Mr. Holt appeared, but at that time the Court asked him if he represented Mr. Dawley and Mr. Holt said, he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.655" offset="4162560">Now, I think we should bear in this mind, it was December 11th that Mr. Holt said he did not represent Mr. Dawley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.680" offset="4190668">Now, bring this over then into the latter part of December when Mr. Dawley appeared before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.355" offset="4225358">He was still at the same time trying to get the judge disqualify himself and made this motion that was indeed December 27th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.837" offset="4251272">The Court overruled that motion on December 28th, refused to disqualify himself in this non-summary proceeding, in other words, to hear the show cause on Mr. Dawley's part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.925" offset="4295680">Now, on January the 8th and this was the date in which they were originally scheduled to appear, there is apparently, some dispute in the record as to where he did appear or did not appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.489" offset="4345940">In the Federal District Court, he said that he did appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.877" offset="4355448">He was served and did appear, but in the transcript of the record, in which he presented for this Court or for the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia, he said, he was not served with the notice and therefore he did not appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.414" offset="4401633">Now on January the 17th, he filed this motion as Mr. Dawley pro se filed in that non-summary contempt action, a motion to change the venue and this is the basis for the contempt which is appearing here in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.065" offset="4464222">Mr. Dawley filed this motion to which he attached an affidavit, in which he made some very, very serious allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.675" offset="4494629">And I don't believe in any court, whether in the Federal Court or whether in the State Courts, this Court could say that that was a legitimate motion or to change the venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.496" offset="4533917">I just don't believe this Court has ever said that and intends to say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.382" offset="4549486">All you have to do to see what type of motion was filed in this case as to see what Mr. Holt read into the record when he appeared there on the 30th at which time he said he then represented Mr. Dawley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.923" offset="4607687">Now, throughout this affidavit and this motion that was read into the record by the Mr. Holt, I think you will see that what he was attempting to do in making these wild allegations and supported by any non-interested witness, but wild allegations of his own that not only was the territory of Hopewell, Virginia inflamed against the Negro race and Mr. Dawley, generally and specifically, but so was the judge and so was the member or the clerk, and so was all -- so were all the other officials of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.887" offset="4743523">They were prejudiced against him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2177.571" offset="8710269">In this case, we have a non-summary proceeding which has already been set up in full array as required by this Court to determine whether or not this person, the lawyer in this case Mr. Dawley, did in fact in appeal of thought the process of the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2251.889" offset="9007543">.And therefore, they decided to attack him in the motion to change a venue, the same ground that they used when they went to the Federal District Court and I'll draw your attention to that also -- that they -- while this was pending, they proceeded to Federal district Court to thought this process in this proceeding by alleging in it the very same things that they alleged in the Court itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.258" offset="9088940">And the District Judge said that there's no basis for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.099" offset="9104300">It is not buttressed up by the affidavits of the evidence necessary and therefore, he dismissed it or rather he indicated we would not grant the motion and later on, it was dismissed for failure to pursue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2703.277" offset="10813022">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.263" offset="10820963">I should like to observe very quickly that as I read the decision of the Virginia Supreme Court, it seems that they are suggesting that any venue change motion is automatically a suspect and that the only possible explanation which could have been given by way of disclaimer of intentional disrespect would have been to withdraw the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.086" offset="10900271">And, of course, this could not be done because the motion -- if the motion had a serious purpose and was seriously intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.874" offset="10923468">It seems to me that the essence of this case is that it's one thing to deny a motion after giving it fair consideration, lengthy or brief as the case maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.348" offset="10977384">It's quite another thing to state that the reaction to this motion is that the motion is contemptuous and that its makers are subjected to criminal sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.847" offset="11007373">And that's exactly which has happened here and I believe that it is established indeed by the cases cited by the Learned Attorney General in his brief on page 17, which presumed to indicate that the Virginia Law requires the affidavits of disinterested witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.585" offset="11062335">First as I read these cases, I don't find that to be exactly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.764" offset="11074978">I think that the Virginia Law requires that there be preponderance of evidence to establish it one way or another, affidavits being only one way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.120" offset="11104444">But what is significant is that in all of these cases, the motions were denied but there were no contempt proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.526" offset="11130044">It was not considered to be contemptuous and in the first of these cited cases, the judge was accused of personal prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.077" offset="11156271">The judge's brother was accused of being personally involved in the litigation, but simply the motion was considered, the motion was denied, it was not contemptuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.293" offset="11193156">May it please the Court, my learned friend has stated in his eloquent brief that certainly because this petition is alleged to be civil rights lawyers representing Negro clients in pursuit of civil rights objectives, they're not entitled to anymore rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.985" offset="11251879">We certainly agree, but by the same token, they're not entitled to any less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.202" offset="11268807">Thank you very much.</text>
