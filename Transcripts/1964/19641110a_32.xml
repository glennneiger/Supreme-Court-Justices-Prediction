            <text syncTime="15.133" offset="60500">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.194" offset="72725">First may I say, I'm afraid that I didn't fully get the import of the question that Mr. Justice Goldberg asked me yesterday nor that did I as fully answered the question of Mr. Justice Harlan as I should have liked.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.558" offset="150152">And I hope that I may be permitted in the course of my argument to return to both of these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.908" offset="175543">At the conclusion of yesterday's session, I had come to the point where following a dismissal of the plaintiff's complaint after first jury trial and a reversal and remand by the Court of Appeals, there had been an application made to require the plaintiff to furnish a bond for security of costs which was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.427" offset="277629">And a bond of $10,000 required first modified to $6000 and that was followed by dismissal of plaintiff's complaint for failure to furnish the bond which resulted in a second appeal to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.713" offset="350772">That court reversed holding that the requirement for the furnishing of the bond had the effect of depriving the plaintiff of his day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.761" offset="391001">And in the course of its opinion the court volunteered to grant a pointed observations concerning what it described as the expansive way of trying the case which had been followed by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.808" offset="451187">And it referred particularly to the bringing of witnesses from Saudi Arabia.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.482" offset="477832">And Judge Clark, the late Judge Clark, speaking for the unanimous court indicated very plainly that the -- that in the circumstances of this case having in mind the various factors such as the amount involved and the condition of the parties, the plaintiff, that resort could have been had and should have been had to the deposition procedures prescribed by the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.765" offset="599040">Thereafter, a second trial was had before Judge Weinfeld, the jury in the course of its long deliberations returned and reported it was unable to agree and after some additional instructions from the court returned, deliberated further, and returned a verdict for the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.774" offset="699037">The first was $10,000 and the -- we applied for reargument and the District Judge reduced it to $6000 and we had made proof which the Court of Appeals considered sufficient that we were unable to furnish either such bond.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kalman I. Nulman</label>
            <text syncTime="193.039" offset="772075">Following the second dismissal, the defendant tax costs at the clerk -- with the clerk and these costs in the first instance amounted to $11,900.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.968" offset="823798">We applied for review and in due course, the second trial judge after deliberation lasting nine months rendered an opinion and decision wherein he reduced the -- by -- the costs to the sum of some $800.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.830" offset="923272">And in the course of this opinion, Judge Weinfeld made reference first to the Court of Appeals' decision and its scriptures on the methods of trying the case followed by the defendant, made his own observation as to the free and easy method adopted by the defendant and that's the language of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.519" offset="1034031">And as an instance of the free and easy method followed by the defendant, he gave the illustration of an argument of a motion for summary judgment about a year prior to the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.097" offset="1100382">The defendant had, without any request of the court or any indication by the court that it desired a transcript of the minutes, had ordered the minutes of that hearing and attached the cost of those minutes against the plaintiff at the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.938" offset="1175719">I might say that the costs of the first trial were taxed and reviewed while our appeal was before the Court of Appeals and we had already served and filed our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.109" offset="1248340">The first trial judge declined to stay the taxation but the Court of Appeals, on our application, did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.676" offset="1278642">Now Judge Weinfeld --</text>

            <label>Mr. Kalman I. Nulman</label>
            <text syncTime="323.737" offset="1294942">It was two volumes of several thousands of pages, and fortunately for us the defendant had ordered those minutes and had filed them in the office of the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.518" offset="1365995">That is, the stenographer had filed his copy in the office of the clerk and we made extracts from that record and the actual printed record of the appeal amounted to some 60 pages and was this size.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.976" offset="1435899">That is to say without the appendix, it was 50 pages and there were an additional 74 printed pages for our principal brief and half again as much for our reply brief, and that was the extent of the printed record.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.578" offset="1518237">As for the actual court record, the -- it was extremely voluminous and the volume ran to, I think and I hope I'm not in error, 1200 to 1300 pages, that was the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.058" offset="1596186">And in that regard, I might -- for the information that the court say that the plaintiff who was the only live witness called in his behalf took up just the smallest part of that on his own direct examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.182" offset="1656686">His cross-examination consumed twice the extent of his -- it's direct and the balance were taken up with the witnesses called by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.075" offset="1704229">Now Judge Weinfeld said that here was an instance of the free and easy approach to litigation followed by the defendant who ordered the minutes of the argument of the motion without any request from the court or any indication that the court desired its use.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.569" offset="1770266">And the cost of those minutes was taxed by the first trial judge without any reference to the actual judge who had heard the motion as to its necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.918" offset="1807569">Now in our brief we call attention to that portion of Judge Weinfeld's decision and the defendant replied that the first trial judge had considered those minutes as necessary and included a quotation from the first trial's judge's decision which referred to three pretrial hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.027" offset="1892101">While these pretrial hearings had no reference to these particular minutes as I pointed out last night, and they refer to three separate pretrial hearings at which the minutes were taken and for which costs were taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.528" offset="1958034">Now, in addition to that, the trial -- the second trial judge stated that in bringing this suit the plaintiff acted in good faith and that in determining whether or not live witnesses should be brought from far off places, the rule laid down by the Court of Appeals in an opinion written by Mr. Justice -- then Judge Harlan, that the condition of the respected parties should be taken into accounts as well as the magnitude of the matters involved and the subject of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.797" offset="2139115">And that in his opinion, the magnitude and subject of the action didn't require it, and he said further it well may be that the various procedures followed by the defendant served its convenience as well as that of its counsel but that they were not necessary within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.542" offset="2222080">And to impose a staggering burden of this kind upon a defeated litigant in this situation of this plaintiff could well have the effect of closing the courts to a great many litigants.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.234" offset="2276833">The language is my own but the sentiment was that of the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.897" offset="2295536">Before the second trial judge, the defendant argued that it should follow the previous determination of the first judge as a matter of comity and as a matter of orderly procedure but he declined to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.856" offset="2355409">An appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals and we opposed the appeal on the ground, first that the appeal involved only the matter of costs and that the costs have been determined in the discretion of the court and that under these conditions, under the rule laid down by this Court that was not appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.227" offset="2468885">Now, I might say that in that appeal, the defendant did not urge that there had been an abuse of discretion nor did it urge that the failure to follow the first judge's determination was erroneous as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.598" offset="2538371">It merely contended that the first judge's determination should have been followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.202" offset="2564807">Following the argument and submission of that appeal, the appellate court apparently divided two to one in favor of affirmance, that is Judges Hayes and Smith voted for affirmance, and the Chief Judge voted for reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.998" offset="2635964">And they thought that the importance of the subject required that the entire court be convened en banc and that was done and the court in a five to four division voted to reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.885" offset="2699494">The Chief Judge, Judges Moore, Judge Friendly, Judge Kaufman and Judge Marshall voted with the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.819" offset="2747246">Judge Smith wrote a dissenting opinion in which Judge Hayes and Judge Clark concurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.852" offset="2783399">Judge Clark wrote a separate concurring opinion and Judge Waterman wrote an opinion of his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.314" offset="2809208">Now I'll state Judge Waterman's position first.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.887" offset="2823523">He believed that the determination should be affirmed, but unlike both the majority and the minority, he was of the opinion that the District Judge should be left with discretion to determine whether or not in a given case the exigencies of that particular case did not require that costs in a greater amount than those prescribed by the rule or those limited by the 100-mile limitation should not be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.951" offset="2955703">Now as to that, I should like to comment first that I feel that the right of access to the court is so vital and so important and that it is a right and not a privilege that it should not be left for the determination of some individual judge, in some circumstances we know nothing about, but which we can imagine from this very case as to whether a litigant would be permitted to litigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.722" offset="3062805">We think he -- every litigant, every person and every citizen is entitled to litigate as a matter of right and not by reason of judicial favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.470" offset="3105855">So, I get back to the majority view.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.782" offset="3115050">The majority first commented on our contention that this was not appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.623" offset="3158413">And they said that they believed that since the enactment of these particular rules which gave the District Judge discretion as to whether or not costs should be taxed, the rule previously laid down by this Court to the effect that of judgments for costs alone where the question of discretion alone was involved was no longer valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.356" offset="3269381">Well, what the majority overlooked was that the rule laid down by this Court was so laid down precisely because the District Judge had discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.197" offset="3312744">And they said that because the District Court had discretion, a judgment for costs alone was not appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.916" offset="3347644">However, that determination and this is the part of the answer that I feel I should've given Mr. Justice Goldberg yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.250" offset="3384947">That determination isn't -- I'm afraid before this Court although I've included it as one of the questions, in the thought that if this Court wished to make any comment on the subject it would be in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.225" offset="3436878">It's not before the Court because that determination was not essential to the holding of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.426" offset="3465613">The Court of Appeals having put its granting of the right to appeal on a totally different ground namely that the failure of the second judge to follow the holding of the first judge was erroneous as a matter of law, and that it was that disregard of the law which gave the defendant the right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.389" offset="3557460">Therefore, the question as to whether a purely discretionary determination as to cost was appealable or not, or whether the rule laid down by this Court was or was not valid while they passed upon it, it was pure dicta so far as this determination was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.408" offset="3625587">And it's for that reason Your Honor that I said yesterday that the determination of the Court of Appeals put the case in a different posture altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.164" offset="3664562">And I can't come here and say that they should never have been given the right to appeal because costs alone were involved, because the Court of Appeals said “Well, cost alone weren't involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.683" offset="3710642">The requirement of law is that you must follow the decision of the first judge.”</text>
            <text syncTime="933.828" offset="3735301">And having violated that rule of law there here is a matter of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.322" offset="3761215">Now, I get to the point and this is where I should have answered Mr. Justice Goldberg's answer -- question in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.462" offset="3797786">It's perfectly true that if this Court should hold that the Court of Appeals erred in determining that as a matter of law that a second judge was bound to follow the ruling of the first judge, there need be no further determination as to what we considered to be the main question of this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.129" offset="3880438">And I was so obsessed, I must tell you, with the thought of the importance of this question that I merrily in my own mind disregarded the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.018" offset="3920039">And I hope that this is a more satisfactory answer than the one I gave yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.615" offset="3942400">Now, as to the question put by Mr. Justice Harlan, in the various decisions and there have been many and various decision with many and various reasons given as to why the 100-mile limitation should or should not be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.163" offset="4020558">The one that seemed to me to make the most sense and the one that came closer to the heart and core of this whole matter was one in Michigan in 1888 by District Court Judge in the case of Vernan which is cited in one of the opinions in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.536" offset="4094119">And if I may just read that, it explains so exactly what my thought was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.833" offset="4115331">He said, “I see no reason why he” referring to the litigant, “might not procure the attendance of an important witness from California or even Australia or other remote quarter of the globe and practically ruin the opposite party by the accumulation of costs”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.808" offset="4191190">And it was for that reason that that particular court adhered to the 100-mile limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.825" offset="4215223">But I must say that none of these cases follow any routine or any pattern except the latter of the cases which have fallen into a pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.857" offset="4255347">And each of the cases which might be considered to have formulated the rule, all appear to me to have been decided on an ad hoc basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.856" offset="4291396">It depended on the equities of the particular situation, and it was in that fashion that the rule evolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.087" offset="4320340">And I have made no effort in our brief to improve upon the reasons given in the dissenting opinions below as to the justifications of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.254" offset="4360986">First, it would be presumptuous and it would be supererogation and frankly, I myself see no logic in the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.876" offset="4391497">And to me it's more important that there is such rule than to find a reason for it any more than I would find a reason for the 100-mile limitation prescribed by this Court in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.239" offset="4444891">Now the point that I come to now deals with the requirement that in exercising his discretion under the rule as to whether to grant or withhold cost, a judge is bound to take into consideration the views expressed by another judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.881" offset="4523468">It seems to me that in the very nature of a discretion conferred upon a judge, it's an impossibility to say to a judge, “You may exercise your discretion provided you give weight to views expressed by other judges”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.430" offset="4593685">Discretion isn't given by withholding it at the time that you're given it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.415" offset="4617613">Secondly, the reason that was given seemed to me not to be a very valid reason and the Court said with great concern for the sensitivity of the judge affected and for his views that they thought that it was not altogether proper to affront a judge by disregarding his views and having another judge come to a different conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.232" offset="4740911">Well, it seems to me that by the time a judge has ascended the bench, he has become pretty well accustomed to contrariety of opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.648" offset="4778527">If he hasn't, by virtue of his practice and by virtue of his encounter with his adversaries in the courts, he has in many, many ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.349" offset="4817293">And once he ascends the bench, he encounters contrariety of opinion from at least 50% of the lawyers who appear before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.952" offset="4851775">True, he has the ascendancy but every time appellate court speaks, he is subjected to the trauma of contrariety of opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.865" offset="4895451">And if he happens to be a married man, and is fortunate in having teenage children, he encounters it at home every day of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.368" offset="4933381">And if I may borrow an expression of Samuel Johnson's in his essay on hope, and he said concerning Addison if contrariety could poison a politician, he would not live a single day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.089" offset="5000255">And so I say if contrariety could poison a judge, he would not live a single day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.486" offset="5021884">So to say that a judge may not exercise the discretion conferred upon him by law for fear of giving offense to another judge who is previously expressed an opinion just -- it doesn't conform to the realities of the situation and offers no justification for the denial of justice to the litigant who may be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.166" offset="5112581">And more important than that, the second judge in this particular case had the advantage in deciding whether to grant or withhold costs of having an expression by the Court of Appeals on the manner of trying this case in various other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.978" offset="5179873">And the discretion conferred by the statute should be given as the situation stands right up to the moment of the exercise of discretion and should not permit the dead hand of some prior determination made under other circumstances to control his conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.030" offset="5264091">So, I say that the rule isn't a good one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.106" offset="5276421">It could lead only to confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.831" offset="5287288">And in this particular case it shows the extent to which it can confuse when the Court of Appeals while holding that the second trial judge was bound to follow the first trial judge, held at the same time that a good portion of the first trial judge's determination was erroneous and it reversed that portion of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.190" offset="5372656">So, I think Your Honors that this is a rule that's so important that so vitally affects litigants particularly those who don't have great means that clarification of the rule for the guidance of all of the circuits should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.499" offset="5445904">And I believe it should be made in the manner proposed by the minority below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.809" offset="5479236">Now, the next point that I come to is the point that we consider that -- I should like just to say about that that the controverted points that the Court of Appeals held was erroneous was that when application was made for re-taxation before the first judge, we pointed out that certain seats on the company owned planes had been unoccupied at the same time that these witnesses were brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.692" offset="5638687">And the court suspended his decision as to that portion of the costs and asked for proof under ought as to whether or not first it was company plane, secondly whether they were regularly run trips or whether they will run specially to accommodate these witnesses, and whether they would've been empty seats anyway of these -- to these persons had not occupied them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.445" offset="5741714">And when the proof was furnished by the defendants and it proved that these were regularly scheduled runs which would've run regardless that if these witnesses had not occupied them, those seats would have remained empty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.350" offset="5793332">To our great surprise he nevertheless made the award and held that because the defendants accounting procedures were perfectly correct and proper that he should make the allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.845" offset="5851324">Now, the second point that I come to and that we consider the really important point is the amount of costs that were taxed here and the great danger that would result to this country and to its citizens if some curb were not put upon the taxing of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.116" offset="5948395">We have said and the defendant has not controverted, that if the limitation were removed as proposed by the court below, the costs would be enlarged to such an amount as to close the doors of our courthouse to a large numbers of our citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.006" offset="6039928">That has not been controverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.678" offset="6046616">We have appended some summary showing the earnings of the citizenry of this country and there has been no mention made of this chart nor of the conclusion that we draw from it by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.335" offset="6105339">And they -- I don't know whether they intend to argue the matter but their briefs had not discussed the subject at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.692" offset="6430720">As to their intending to tax them for costs, we had no idea about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.355" offset="6453394">We had thought that the costs would be limited pretty much as they were in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.025" offset="6484010">And we had a great deal of difficulty, as a matter of fact, in examining the defendant's witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.775" offset="6515043">We deferred to the convenience of the defendant and exceeded to their request for numerous adjournments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.694" offset="6542733">One day, we were told that we could examine a particular witness but that we would have to examine him that day and conclude his examination that day because he was going back to Saudi Arabia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.984" offset="6591843">We had to drop everything that we were doing and sit down and spent an entire day without respite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.186" offset="6612741">Examined great numbers of documents and that was the end of that, off they went.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.599" offset="6642312">Now, I might say and I know that this is a subject that's not appropriate in this Court, I could have had the occasion arisen demonstrated that there was no need for many of the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.264" offset="6708976">The defendant staged what I only could describe as an extravaganza, complete with pretty ladies in uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.876" offset="6747429">And finally just give one illustration of what I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.951" offset="6767804">I will have to refer again to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.922" offset="6783687">The defendant did not for two years -- for approximately two years after the commencement of trial assert a defense of justification for this charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.108" offset="6836349">It had examined the plaintiff at the very outset of the case and had elicited certain facts upon which it later predicated its defense of justification, but for two years it never moved to include that as a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.766" offset="6903014">Now what did that defense consisted?</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.283" offset="6917120">The defendant had a rule at its hospital in Saudi Arabia that before any surgical operation, certain preoperative procedures should be followed, the taking of a blood count and a blood -- and a urine analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.853" offset="7015340">Now the physician or the surgeon performing the surgery had no responsibility for the taking of these preoperative tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.684" offset="7058704">That was prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.102" offset="7064346">There was a staff set up to do it, they did it as automatically as anything else could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.313" offset="7089215">And in the particular instant, I am talking about these preoperative procedures were taken and the results were negative, that is to say they proved satisfactory for the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.815" offset="7155252">The doctor in his examination was asked whether he had taken these procedures and he said truthfully he had not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.416" offset="7193600">And then thinking to justify the failure to take them, his failure to take them, he went on to say they were unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.343" offset="7229336">The fact of the matter was these procedures as I said were taken and proved negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.114" offset="7252428">Now the doctor had said he had never seen a written rule requiring such procedures and that same statement was made in the examination before trial and at trial by the doctor's superior, the head of the particular medical installation who said he also had never seen a written rule to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.420" offset="7361620">Now out of the doctor's statement, our client's statement that he has never seen such rule, they called medical experts to prove the terrible consequences that comes from not following such rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.950" offset="7415745">They called the head of a former -- of a hospital at which the plaintiff had formally been employed to say that while in that hospital many years earlier, the plaintiff had acknowledged receipt of a set of rules which included such rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.439" offset="7481678">Well, the validity or the usefulness of such a rule wasn't in controversy nor did we challenged the necessity for the preoperative procedures prescribed and yet from the witnesses that were called it was made to appear as if we opposed all procedures, we were against them, that we charged ahead and didn't do them and the narrow issue that was in this case was whether the doctor had been orally informed of the results of these procedures before commencing the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.869" offset="7631412">And on that narrow issue, they justified the calling of all manner of witnesses and I think (Inaudible) -- I think that their necessity really was conjured up in the minds of the defendant but a rich and resourceful defendant can justify the necessity to most anything if he thinks it will help win the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.756" offset="7734962">I see my time is approaching -- the end of my time is approaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.232" offset="7752829">I regret that I haven't had a chance to conclude it but I think that the justice of the point we make, namely that in a country where all of us are subordinate to the laws, the executive, the judiciary and the administrative departments, where all our rights are tied up in the constitution, where every thing that we cherish, whether be person, liberty or property, depends upon the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.909" offset="7879576">We can't depend upon the dead letter of the constitution to ensure to our citizens those rights unless they're given the means of establishing them and enforcing them in a court of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.173" offset="7940598">And if they're forced to buy a ticket of admission and pay as they'd go, many, many citizens who can't afford to purchase the ticket or pay their way would be deprived of what they're entitled to as a matter of right from the state which has taken away from each of us the right of self-help in aid of our rights and has substituted the power of the state which we are committed to extend to every citizen.</text>

            <text syncTime="2018.609" offset="8074344">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.709" offset="8094824">In Mr. Nulman's statement yesterday, he stated that there is -- that the (Inaudible) respondent in one case, the petitioner and another, had pay -- played fast and loose with the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.413" offset="8173610">I'm very much disturbed about such a statement being made to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.213" offset="8196807">In the first place I must say again as I said to Mr. Nulman, I will rely on the record and I will rely on the statements made in my reply brief, but I should like to have just one opportunity to point out the type of fast and looseness that Mr. Nulman speaks of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.373" offset="8293460">At page 3, Mr. Nulman's answering brief in Number 33, he states although the words leech -- rich litigant I enclosed by the defendant in quotation marks followed by a reference to pages 754, 755, the reference in our brief was T74 and T55 of the transcript of this record which is before this Court, wherein this quotation is presumably to be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.530" offset="8450090">The fact is that neither at that place nor elsewhere is such a quotation to be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.209" offset="8480810">Judge Weinfeld never used any such term nor did he refuse to award the defendant an allowance on any such ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.215" offset="8516859">And now Your Honors, I would like to refer to the record before this Court and I refer to pages 54 and 55 of the record which is an opinion by Judge Weinfeld delivered by him on September the 11th, 1962 relating to costs that had been taxed and on his review of the taxation of those costs on the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.424" offset="8645695">At page 54, Judge Weinfeld stated that Rule 54 (d), the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which provides that cost shall be allowed as of cost to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs, vest discretion in the court in passing upon the necessity and reasonableness of the costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.715" offset="8758857">The policy of the federal courts has been to keep litigation cost down as particularly enunciated in Rule 1 of the rule -- Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.491" offset="8805878">And then Judge Weinfeld proceeds to quote from that Rule, “To secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.781" offset="8851122">That is the end of the quotation from the Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.428" offset="8865646">Judge Weinfeld then proceeds to stay the court's discretion should be exercised in conformity with that policy to quote -- to avoid “making the federal court only for rich litigants”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.803" offset="8943177">The quotation is from a statement contained in the opinion of Circuit Judge Clark on the appeal from the order dismissing the complaint for the failure -- from the plaintiff's failure to furnish a bond for security -- for costs.</text>
