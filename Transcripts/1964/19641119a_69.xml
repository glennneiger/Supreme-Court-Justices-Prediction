            <label>Mr. Felix J. Bilgrey</label>
            <text syncTime="40.074" offset="160287">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.801" offset="171154">This case comes to this Court on appeal from the judgment of the Maryland Court of the Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.961" offset="191843">The judgment appealed upon affirmed a criminal conviction and a fine of $25 pronounced by the Baltimore Criminal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.424" offset="225593">That Court found Ronald Freedman, the appellant, guilty of violating sections of the Maryland Code which establishes the Maryland Motion Picture Censor Board and which make it a crime to commercially, publicly exhibit any film not submitted to that Board together with the amounted fee and which is not approved and licensed by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.097" offset="304379">To put concretely, this appeal puts the question before this Court whether Maryland can compatibly with the First and Fourteenth Amendments impose criminal penalties on the act of exhibiting a film which as Maryland has here conceded, does not run a foul any valid First Amendment standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.954" offset="383791">The question arose in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.513" offset="394031">The appellant, Ronald Freedman, is a lessee of a motion picture theater located in Baltimore.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.463" offset="417750">He is on principle unsympathetic to the idea of censorship and I may add, he has had a series of disputes with the Board in which he's always come out on top.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.274" offset="457038">He's always disputed the discretionary authority of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.005" offset="475951">In at least one instance, as the record in this case indicates at page 15 of the record, the appellant have to fight the Board on a ban of a film which after many months in a great expense, he was finally vindicated on and this was a film like all others, he thought that he could in his judgment play without submitting to the Board to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.642" offset="570514">It was against this background that Mr. Freedman decided in the fall of 1962 to test directly the authority of the Maryland Motion Picture Censor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.529" offset="610116">Accordingly, he called and this is at page 17 on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.593" offset="626312">He called one of the officials of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.611" offset="634358">In fact, he called the Chief Reviewer and he told her of his intension to ignore or to defy the law that he would commercially exhibit a film without a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.890" offset="679497">And that evening, when in fact he exhibited the film, the Chief Reviewer was present and she caused Mr. Freedman to be arrested after the exhibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.546" offset="714083">Now, he was arrested for the alleged violation of Section 2 of Article 66A of the Maryland Code which makes it unlawful and incidentally, that is at page 1 of our record.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.933" offset="763716">Section 2 makes it unlawful to exhibit any motion picture film, and the statute is concerned with commercial exhibitions, in the State of Maryland unless the set film has been submitted by the lessee of the film and duly approved and licensed by the Motion Picture Censor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.452" offset="829753">I should like to point out to the Court at this time that principal provisions of Article 66A are set forth at pages 3 through 5 of our brief and that the entire article is reproduced as Appendix A following page 41 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.743" offset="898926">At some months later, Ronald Freedman was tried in the Baltimore Criminal Court on this charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.773" offset="923063">And at the trial, we -- Mr. Freedman sought to introduce testimony which it admitted would have indicated that the Chief Reviewer, Mrs. Holland would have passed the film -- had been submitted to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.369" offset="985443">However, the State objected to the introduction of that evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.877" offset="999445">However, in response to a question by Judge Darrell, he was the trial judge, the State made it clear that it would have licensed the film and that there were no objections to the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.096" offset="1048346">Now, at pages 2 -- I'm sorry, page 7 through 9 in our brief, we -- the appellant developed a testimony from the members of the Board of Censors as to how the Censor Board actually functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.949" offset="1123788">I mentioned that because I do not believe I will have time to take up that testimony but I would like to point out that among the things that Mr. Freedman demonstrated was that the Board takes in fees for every print that is commercially shown in a motion picture theatre in the State of Maryland and that the fees average about $30 for initial prints and about roughly $15 for sub -- for all subsequent prints.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.262" offset="1464947">I think the sole requirement here of the fee pertains to the Board, to the Censor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.996" offset="1491905">This is not a tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="442.512" offset="1769953">I hardly can allege that Mr. Justice Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.025" offset="1784059">Now, at the close of the testimony, Mr. Freedman moved for judgment of acquittal on various federal grounds which are set forth verbatim at pages 8 and 9 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.371" offset="1825437">Specifically, the appellant urge on the trial judge that Article 66A is an infringement of the rights of free speech, that the standards are vague and indefinite and also that the -- that it imposes a tax on the exercise of protected rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.430" offset="1881652">These constitutional claims had been urged that every level of this litigation and the reason that I mentioned them here is because I hardly think I will have time to develop them on this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.311" offset="1925224">Now, some two months after the completion of the trial, Judge Sidero (ph) filed a memorandum opinion which is set forth in the record at page 75 in which he overruled Mr. Freedman's federal claims and which he denied his motion for acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.536" offset="1982067">And he then convicted Mr. Freedman and he fine him $25.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.200" offset="1996800">Of course he could have sent him to jail and before the payment of the fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.449" offset="2013727">To put the matter briefly, the trial judge held that the appellant's claims with foreclosed by this Court's ruling in the Times Film Corporation case, 365 U.S. 43.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.207" offset="2056777">The Court of Appeals affirmed the appellant's conviction and that opinion is set forth at page 78 of our record and also is reported at 197 A. 2nd 232.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.207" offset="2108813">Also, I should note that the opinion appears as an appendix to our jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.269" offset="2128980">Now, the Court of Appeals like the trial judge, ruled that Mr. Freedman was without standing to attack any section in this statute other than Section 2 under which he had been indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.782" offset="2187076">And as to that section, the Court of Appeals felt that this Court had foreclosed the issue in its holding in the Times Film case.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.757" offset="2226991">Now, however, before rendering that decision or rather in -- at page 80 in our record, we quote verbatim from a portion of the decision of the Maryland Court of Appeals because we believe that that quotation totally undermines the asserted applicability of the Times Film's case to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.822" offset="2315285">I'd like to read from page 80 of our record, the last sentence of the first paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.880" offset="2335451">Parenthetically, it is noted that neither the appellant nor the State even suggests that the film “Revenge at Daybreak” would violate any of the standard set out in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.748" offset="2374949">And the State has conceded that it would have been approved, had it been submitted for licensing.</text>

            <text syncTime="606.977" offset="2427820">And we believe that the Times Film case has completely presented the completely different proposition to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.851" offset="2463347">In Times Film, the petitioner asked for a Federal District Court and ultimately this Court for total judicial protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.930" offset="2495634">I mean total judicial protection against the Chicago ordinance which in res -- in all essential respect similar to this statute require -- which would have required the issuance of a permit to show a film called “Don Juan”, or in the alternative to enjoin the Chicago ordinance -- the Chicago authorities from preventing in showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.601" offset="2590302">However, this Court pointed out that the -- the only question that was decided was whether or not, this Court should grant a total judicial protection to the showing of all films.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.520" offset="2638054">I should like to read from this Court's decision in the Times Film case to point -- to point out what we consider as a vital distinction between the Times Film case and the Freedman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.065" offset="2680163">I'm reading now from page 46 and 47 of the Times Film decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.923" offset="2699598">Moreover, there was not a word in the record as to the nature and content of “Don Juan”.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.399" offset="2721541">We are left entirely in the dark in this regard, as were city officials and other reviewing courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.629" offset="2746514">The petitioner claims that the nature of the film is irrelevant and that even if this film contains the basic type of pornography or incitement to riot or forceful overthrow of the government, it may nonetheless be shown without prior submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.514" offset="2801998">Now, it was on those premises that this Court declined to require a Federal District Court to compel the state authorities to issue the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.003" offset="2835958">In short, as this Court has recently observed in Bantam Books at 372 U.S. 58 in -- in a footnote, the only question tended to this Court in the Times Film case was whether a prior restraint was necessarily unconstitutional under all circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="875.157" offset="3500617">I'd like to read from page 65 and 66 of the Times Film decision in which the Chief Justice referred -- referring to the Kingsley Books case pointed out what we consider a major distinction between this procedure and the procedure in Kingsley Books.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.372" offset="3569476">In Kingsley, the Chief Justice said, the person enjoined had available the defense that the written or printed matter was not obscene if an -- if an attempt was made to punish him for disobedient of the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.418" offset="3613571">The Chicago ordinance admits no defense in the prosecution for failure to procure a license other than that the motion picture was submitted to the Censor and a license was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.512" offset="3650038">Now, as has been so dramatically illustrated in this case, the Maryland statute like the Chicago ordinance admits no such defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.861" offset="3683370">In short, it is our position that that this statute, like the Chicago ordinance, presents exactly the pitfall which was commented upon by -- by Professor Paul Freund to whom Mr. Justice Frankfurter was -- was referring when he wrote the -- his decision in the Kingsley Books case.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.721" offset="3766857">Specifically, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, in writing that Kingsley Books decision, added a footnote at page four -- 443 which – which I would like to -- which I would like to read to the Court if I may because I believe it's pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.051" offset="3840104">This comparison of remedy takes note of the fact that we do not have before us a case where although the issue of obscenity is ultimately decided in favor of the bookseller.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.400" offset="3877512">The State nevertheless attempts to punish him for disobedience of the interim injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.142" offset="3896529">For all we know, Mr. Justice Frankfurter concluded, New York may impliedly condition the temporary injunction so as not to subject the bookseller to a charge of contempt if he prevails on the issue of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.542" offset="3946162">Now, this is precisely the -- what we believe is a constitutional pitfall in this statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1022.036" offset="4088059">However, I believe that once it is established that a motion picture is permissible constitutionally, that certainly at that point, the rule is the same with respect to any medium of expression.</text>

            <text syncTime="1682.907" offset="6731546">Chief Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.375" offset="6785463">We accept the facts that -- that have been presented here by the appellant with one or two exception which we do not believe are too material but we would like to call with the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.340" offset="6841260">First of all, we have a situation here where Mr. Freedman called a Censorship Board, told them the hour and the place where he was going to show this film “Revenge at Daybreak”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.187" offset="6908656">And Mrs. Holland who was a reviewer employed by the Board at that juncture specifically told him that he would be violating the laws of the State of Maryland specifically Section 2 of Article 66A which is our censorship law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.767" offset="6983053">Mr. Freedman and the record will show, said that that is exactly what he wanted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.835" offset="7003324">He wanted to set up a test case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.295" offset="7017117">When Mrs. Holland went to the theater that evening and viewed the film for the purpose of saying whether it did have a state censorship seal on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.358" offset="7061420">Mr. Freedman was there with his lawyer and after the movie, when she presented him with a violation notice, he accepted it in the presence of his lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.446" offset="7109695">In addition to that, we have one other thing which we -- item we like to call the Court's attention and that is although in the appellant's brief, they emphasize that over a period of 40 years, the revenue which the Board has realized through its license fees with an excess of half a million dollars, that's a little over 11 to 12,000 – a little over $12,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.395" offset="7225574">There had been several years, including 1959, 1962, and it would have been in operating in the deficit in ‘61 if it had not been for none appropriated or non-expended appropriation of $1500.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.460" offset="7285760">The point I'm making is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.317" offset="7293179">A fee charge is an administrative fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.506" offset="7305927">It's not a revenue fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.795" offset="7311151">It is a fee to cover the expenses of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.215" offset="7328810">Now, we reach with this case again the Armageddon of censorship because it is obvious what Freedman has done in this case is to try to put more flesh on the old Times Film case versus Chicago which this Court heard in 1961 and bring it back to the Court, the same old purpose, with a little bit more of flesh on it because it's in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.296" offset="7457123">I want to rather elaborate things to show that Mrs. Holland who had seen the film to see if it had the censorship seal on it, stated after the film was over that if they exhibited to the Board anyway, they would have approve it because it was innoxious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.698" offset="7530789">The very inception of this case, the State has taken the stand that the film was innoxious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.423" offset="7557642">And the trial of the case before Judge Sidero (ph), they kept insisting that the judge see the film, the judge -- that he didn't see where it was -- any point to seeing the film, no point of viewing it, that's not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.613" offset="7606439">The standards aren't the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.254" offset="7612918">That they admit that the film is -- is innoxious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.362" offset="7625352">They finally made an arrangement for him to see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.183" offset="7636637">He went to the censorship office -- censor's office in a state office building where they have a little theater and they viewed the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.521" offset="7665998">He again, likewise in his opinion states that it's innoxious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.638" offset="7682508">We contend that this is immaterial entirely to the issue which is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.530" offset="7706018">Now, in the Times Film case when it was heard by this Court, you have Justice Clark stating that the character and nature of the film was unknown but is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.833" offset="7763278">And even Justice Warren in his dissenting opinion in that case, the Court does not even have before it an attempt by the city to restrain the exhibition of an allegedly obscene film.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.765" offset="7815001">Again at page 418, Justice Warren is speaking for the minority of the Court said the inquiry as stated by the Court but never resolved is whether licensing as a prerequisite to exhibition is barred by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.081" offset="7876232">And I submit we have this -- again it's a reprise of the Times Film case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.591" offset="7910296">Those were filed briefs in this case as amicus curiae recognizes it as the same case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.963" offset="7935791">They state the issue in their brief as the same, a question of a pre-review or pre-restraint prior to exhibition for the purpose of reviewing the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.219" offset="7988872">Now, we also contend that if the Court feels that it should have some preview of the censorship laws of the State of Maryland and a question of censorship in general, that what we have here is an effort on the part of the appellant to come back into Court and to again try to rehearse this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.571" offset="8126276">But if we wouldn't take a review of the development of this issue, we note that the appellant makes a very brave array of cases trying to show what great crimes there were have been committed to suppress censorship or to suppress freedom of speech and freedom of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.054" offset="8216137">And they have assembled many of the old landmark cases which have come down to us in the common law and our own great cases here in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.274" offset="8253022">However, all of these brave language has little strength or meaning in the contents of this present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.465" offset="8277786">I'm sure that all of us as Americans have a great appreciation of our Anglo-Saxon heritage of freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.011" offset="8311954">And every cultivated and intelligent man respects and admires the purity of freedom of speech advocated by such great champions as Voltaire, Russo, Peter Zenger, Pane, Thomas Jefferson, we could go on down the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.260" offset="8372976">And we know that recent history introduces -- as introduced to this Court such constitutional eminences as the American cases of J. M. Near, Newton Cantwell and R. J. Thomas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.596" offset="8422296">And we know of the arguments of free speech which have been urged over the decades in the field of Philosophy and Science, a tremendous list of Jehovah Witnesses cases in the field of religion, the cases of Eugene-Debs and trying out these economic theories, and all of these were landmark cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2139.604" offset="8558341">But I submit to this Court that those who lurk around their pornographic fringes of the film industry have no communality with these great landmark cases which we read about with pride as Americans and which certainly as a tribute to this Court in its effort to try to give to us as Americans, as complete of liberty and the exercise of our freedoms as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.522" offset="8674011">Now, we certainly hope that this Court, that this case presented, it would be almost ludicrous, the manner in -- the elaborate way in which this was restaged to get it before this Court if it were not for the profundity of the issue involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.257" offset="8744960">And we certainly submit that this Court will not voluntarily declare its bankruptcy to the libidinous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.872" offset="8775471">And hold that the State of Maryland has no power to its Censorship Board to determine what may or may not be an obscene movie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.854" offset="8819357">If the Court is prone to consider the constitutionality of movie censorship, I should also suggest we think for a moment what has happened to the film industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.774" offset="8859063">We know that family film has practically disappeared from the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.396" offset="8877558">The old face in Western and the mystery has been abandoned to television.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.468" offset="8893858">What remains generally is the predetermined effort of the industry to attract the public primarily to sex and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.419" offset="8929593">Now, for almost 50 years, this Maryland Censorship Board has been in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.965" offset="8951850">We feel that it has not acted arbitrary or capricious for the number of cases that actually get into court as I'm sure the Court is well aware and recognizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.680" offset="9010678">There is a vast multitude of films which never get into litigation because the people who would show them are keenly aware of the existence of the Censorship Board and know that they are obscene, and that they will be turned down so they don't make the effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.973" offset="9071804">Now, if you remove completely censorship, I predict as you would have a complete enroll of these type of films which are certainly today not allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.450" offset="9133767">Just recently, many films -- I'm sure we've all seen -- Maryland goes about as far as anybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="2351.659" offset="9406589">And I might state that there are four of Section 417 and 418 of Article 27 and it's quite doubtful whether they are -- whether they are applicable to films.</text>

            <text syncTime="2384.985" offset="9539918">But let us assume for the sake of argument that our obscenity statute would apply to a film.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.793" offset="9571161">Now, if the movie house operator who is guilty of the violation of showing an obscene film is arrested, he goes before the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.057" offset="9612225">He has an appeal as the court well knows from the magistrate to the Circuit Court and from the Circuit Court to the Court of Appeals, and then can apply to this Court for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.543" offset="9646080">Now, I would presume in the interim that that film will be shown all over the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.505" offset="9661962">By the time the litigation has come to some conclusion as to whether he was guilty of violating the statutes on obscenity of Maryland, that would probably then be ready for a second run of the movie.</text>

            <text syncTime="3302.049" offset="13208137">Before addressing myself to a few of the questions which some of the justices have posed me a little further, I would like to say that I believe that if the view of the Attorney General of Maryland, Mr. Finan, prevails here that the Court may have to overrule the Burstyn case because he cited an example of I think a well with water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.734" offset="13290893">And I recall that this Court held -- I believe it was in Smith case that food for the mind and food for the belly are not one of the same things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.059" offset="13324225">I should also like to state that I -- well, in defending Ronald Freedman, he is involved in the motion picture business and I resent on his behalf the insinuation that -- that what he wants to do is to bring or what anyone else wants to do is to bring a lot of lewd films in into Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.491" offset="13397891">I believe that rests from the completely false assumption that this statute in fact deters people from presenting obscene films to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.134" offset="13428506">Of course, this is entirely conjectural and that we -- we all know that especially with the statute of this nature which is censorship outbreak that there are a lot of people who are inhibited and who may bypass Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.058" offset="13472183">I should now like to address myself to the -- the question on -- that Justice -- Mr. Justice Goldberg and Stewart asked me about in connection with the tax, whether this -- this could be sustained if it were a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.892" offset="13523487">The fact is if it may please the Court, that -- that this is not an ordinary business tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.999" offset="13547938">I think if this were an ordinary business tax, this Court could be confronted by an entirely different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.310" offset="13569149">We think that this is a specific discriminatory tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="3402.042" offset="13608124">In a real sense, this is a tax which discriminates against a particular constitutional right just as Maryland, in an earlier case, well over hundred years ago in McCulloch versus Maryland sought to distinguish against the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.901" offset="13667579">And of course, that was not sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="3430.642" offset="13722540">Now, we do not believe that that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.812" offset="13735184">We think that a -- to overrule Times Film would dismantle any system of censorship although that would not necessarily itself entail to -- total judicial protection to motion pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.556" offset="13782204">We believe, however, that we have a much narrower case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.588" offset="13798296">The Attorney General has totally ignored the fact that the film has been shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.995" offset="13815954">In fact he has insinuated that this was -- might not be the proper way to -- for Mr. Freedman to test his beliefs that -- that the conviction has to -- as applied to him is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.005" offset="13855974">I believe in that context that Ms. Thaw (ph) and Mr. Thomas, and many of the other cases that have been before this Court have come up in exactly the same context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.204" offset="13896725">We believe that -- that Maryland could if this Court reverses within the narrow scope of this -- that this movie may conceivably entail that if Maryland's brief -- if this Court reverses, we believe Maryland could still maintain its Film Review Board if it so desire to do so for all those as I have suggested before who want to buy an insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.081" offset="13996304">As long as it is permissible for people who show a film to commit -- who do not want to comply with this as long as it is permissible for those people to come in and to later on any proceeding, this proceeding or any other state proceeding whether it'd be criminal or an injunctive method that this Court might have sustained, that the exhibitor may come in and that it may be able to show that this particular film is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.146" offset="14112496">And therefore, as Mr. Justice Stewart addressed himself to in his concurrence in the Kansas Book case which was brought up before, Mr. Justice Stewart said that the books involved there were not hardcore pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.041" offset="14176131">And therefore he thought that Kansas could not by any procedure constitutionally suppress him anymore than Kansas could constitutionally make their sale or distribution of criminal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.521" offset="14218031">We believe that we are in exactly the same boat here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.653" offset="14230570">And we therefore urge this Court to reverse Ronald Freedman's conviction.</text>
