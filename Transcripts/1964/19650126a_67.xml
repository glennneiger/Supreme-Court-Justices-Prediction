            <text syncTime="21.418" offset="85577">-- members of this Court, I would like to make a personal observation before I begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.324" offset="113267">On the one hand, I have been instructed by the Attorney General of Louisiana to bring his regards to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.276" offset="141061">Secondly, this is my first appearance here having been admitted this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.920" offset="167602">And I want to thank this Court and tell them what a wonderful thing this has been to me today.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.708" offset="206785">As the Court knows, this is a suit by the United States against the State of Louisiana and members of the Board of the Registration of our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.540" offset="258090">It was instituted pursuant to the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 1971 as amended and also under the Declaratory Judgments Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.243" offset="308872">We, defendants, file a motion to dismiss upon the contention that the complaint failed to raise a substantial constitutional question and failed to state a judicial -- justiciable controversy within the jurisdiction of the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.009" offset="380029">The motion was overruled and the cause on the merits was heard before the three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.700" offset="414720">The District Court Judge John Minor Wisdom has the argument that Court rendered the decision with which I'm sure all of you are thoroughly familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.341" offset="461322">He was concor -- he was concorded by Judge Christenberry and dissented for him by Judge Gordon West.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.723" offset="498834">In making the application to this Court on appeal, we set forth to begin with that the court's case should be heard first -- firstly because that was a direct and absolute contradiction between two sections of the District Court in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.807" offset="591203">The suit was dismissed on the question of jurisdiction whereas in our case, the jurisdiction of question was maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.975" offset="631850">We are before this Court then, first of all in our brief taking the position that we adopt and subscribe to the position taken by the State of Mississippi and maintain that this suit too should be dismissed on the same grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.648" offset="702589">You spend enough time with that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.301" offset="709172">It's no use going into that point at further.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.429" offset="721711">Secondly, we argue that the Board of Registration is a party defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.991" offset="759954">It is erroneously included and erroneous like -- erroneously directed to do certain things as such party for the simple reason that the Board of Registration has absolutely no power or authority over the registrars of voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.180" offset="816692">And, that the registrars themselves being the agents of the State and it -- and ministerial officers charged with the performance and the -- and the administration of these functions should be before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.700" offset="874789">And finally, now I know suddenly that our statute is not per se invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.956" offset="907807">And if there is any invalidity that the -- that that -- that was done as a matter of ministerial action.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.084" offset="936333">And that it should have and could be enjoined against the individual registrars who have so violated the intent and the intent -- and the -- intent of the purpose of the statute of the constitutional provision and the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.931" offset="991713">And finally -- and I think -- and possibly the most important position and contention that we make is that the lower court has gone beyond its authority and beyond the record in the case in enjoining the use of the new citizenship test.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.123" offset="1080424">Particularly in doing so, in only 21 parishes of the State, and in particular -- and it's particularly saying in so doing, that it has pre-admitted the question, that it has not ruled on the question of the validity of that particular amendment to our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.522" offset="1162031">But despite that fact has enjoined the State in the use of this minimum standing which we, of course argue that the State has a right to prescribe.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.842" offset="1223367">(Inaudible)</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry J. Kron, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="308.920" offset="1235592">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.038" offset="1240085">I might explain for the Court's benefit in the event that you are not completely familiar with this citizenship test.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.289" offset="1277074">When this suit was first filed, the only provision on the books with respect to a requirement to understand and interpret a section of our Constitution was one very similar, and in content, and in purpose almost identical with the Mississippi statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.503" offset="1353979">However, after this suit was filed, the legislature passed a statute which provided that the Board -- the powers of the Board of Registration were expanded and enlarged.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.335" offset="1413329">Whereby said Board acting under the specific language of the statute in a subsequent constitutional amendment, directed the Board to prescribe a set of rules and regulations in which the State would give a written objective standard test of the person's ability to understand the -- a Republican form of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.201" offset="1512803">The -- the -- the test was formulated and adopted by the Board of Registration and was -- was sent out to the registrars who are directed to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.908" offset="1555540">At that point and this record will show this that at that point, the registrars were directed to discontinue the use of the verbal interpretation test and to use this new written objective standard written test, that the records of which were to be preserved in the Registrar's Office, all rejections to be preserved there.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.838" offset="1647282">If the Court please, this test was designed and issued to the registrars in actual compliance with the formula set down in the Schnell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.717" offset="1690854">And the actual questions for this test -- these are now the cases will show what it were taken from the manual issued and published by the Department of Justice in -- in their prescribed course of study.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.451" offset="1769744">It required of alien applicants for citizenship who were given this manual for study in order that that may take a test of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.521" offset="1810077">Of course, our contention, our purpose was that if an alien applicant for citizenship should know these things, then a citizen of this country who is applying for the privilege to register and to vote should also know them and that that was not an unfair, not a discriminatory method of testing such knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.002" offset="1895967">But it is one of the requirements that we contend that the State had the right to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.009" offset="1920000">I think that there is nothing anywhere in this record to show and I'm positive that there's nothing in any way in this record to show that if the Government has ever contended that the citizenship test has administered after its initiation in 1962, was ever discriminatorily used against any person or classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.404" offset="2009548">The simple contention of the Government there is, that it is a new, more stringent, and onerous requirement which would raise the requirements and establish the -- the freezing situation which they have now ask the Court to remedy and which I asked the Court to remedy by issuing the injunction against the 21 parishes involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.345" offset="2153326">And it says the State Board of Registration recently recognized the arbitrary nature of the test that was indicated earlier and this opinion abandoned its general use and after the institution of the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.943" offset="2199719">However, the Constitution in the statute of Louisiana still requires the use and understanding the interpretation test.</text>

            <text syncTime="556.268" offset="2225006">And registrars have not entirely abandoned it, despite the institution has moved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.677" offset="2246635">For example, this late April 1963, the reps -- Webster Register was using the interpretation test because she explained it still unblocks sometimes she gave the citizenship test and sometimes the interpretation test.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.623" offset="2314449">Is that -- is there --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_j_kron_jr" startTime="579.617" stopTime="933.244">
            <label>Mr. Harry J. Kron, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="579.617" offset="2318420">We don't dispute -- we don't dispute the last sentence of that paragraph, Justice Goldberg, but we do dispute the conclusion of Judge Wisdom in the first part of that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.319" offset="2357185">In the first place, I think he can find nothing in this record to justify the statement of the State Board of Registration recently recognized the arbitrary nature of test when the facts will show that the Board of Registration was directed to issue and formulate the fair and issue the new text.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.651" offset="2446524">Although the Act did not say in place of or in lieu of the interpretation test, it is true that it was the legislature and the people of the State of Louisiana adopting the constitutional amendment subsequent to the original enable the original statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.976" offset="2511830">It was the legislature who changed the policy of the State of Louisiana and not the Board of Registration, who gave -- who made that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.751" offset="2546939">Secondly, it is also true that the Constitution and statutes of the State permit or establish as a standard the use of the verbal interpretation test.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.326" offset="2597303">But, I have to disagree with Judge Wisdom in that I -- we don't think that the statute requires the use of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.336" offset="2621336">We think it will be within the sound discretion of the State and its offices in administering these statutes to either give or not to give as the case may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.577" offset="2662296">Be that as it may, even though it may still require for the sake of argument, the fact is -- the fact is, and the court below has taken notice of that fact which I'll explain to you in just a moment that the -- the verbal interpretation test is not now and has not, since April 1963 been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.732" offset="2746828">And there is no -- nothing in this record to show that there is any intention to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.978" offset="2771905">Now, insofar as the single case of April 1963 in Webster Parish, this -- this record would show Justice Goldberg, that -- that at the argument of this case and its closure and submission to the Court, that I had at that time, made and argued strenuously a motion of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.997" offset="2867931">After the case was submitted, one of the registrars did begin to give the test again.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.297" offset="2893113">The Government filed a motion to reopen the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.721" offset="2902831">They took to the position and she frankly admitted that she gave it on several occasions before a period of a few days.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.479" offset="2941910">That was filed in the record and the case was resubmitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.824" offset="2955285">But since that time, it has not been used, it's not being used, nor is there any intent to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.771" offset="3019024">In all parishes of the State except one parish of either East or West of Louisiana is still on periodic registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.063" offset="3056222">And that new complete registration began on the first of this year and the process of a reregistration at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.730" offset="3090913">Other than that, all parishes, 63, are on permanent registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.838" offset="3127275">As I said before and just for purposes of clarity, the findings of fact and conclusions of law in the lower court degree go beyond the record on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.377" offset="3157473">There is no evidence to establish that the citizenship test is an additional burden or is more difficult than prior procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.106" offset="3192372">On the contrary, Judge Dawkins of the Western District in a case, clearly set forth that in his opinion, that the new citizenship test was clearly not more onerous, or more stringent, nor more than difficult that it was a fair application that has eliminated the arbitrary discretion of the registrar that had been previously complained of by the Government and all of these suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.282" offset="3301042">That it was a simple test whereby the record was kept in the ability of the person to answer the question to as in writing and on the face of it and -- and that was less onerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.444" offset="3353704">Of course, along that line if the Court please, we submit that, we don't think that on the Atkins for one reason and of course under simple logic for another that the state is at ever at anytime ever precluded from making changes in its administration and its laws, in its statute requiring most anything under its police power, under any of the inherent powers of the State, unless and until that change would be as, for instance here, an open effort to formulate policy to discriminate against a class -- a person or a class of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.621" offset="3518380">We wish to submit here that this record clearly shows that the adoption of the citizenship test in lieu of the verbal interpretation test is not an increase in the obligations of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.185" offset="3564669">As a matter of fact, it is a relaxation of the test as easier and it's simpler and it's indiscriminately applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.380" offset="3605420">We also feel that if the -- if the State of Louisiana does have the right first to -- to make such a test and to establish following the rule of Schnell in -- in its every facet.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.723" offset="3674802">And that this test must in order to be enjoined be declared to be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.462" offset="3697789">If it is not -- it is not declared to be invalid then it's -- that it still exists as a valid exercise of the State's right to use it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3003.801" offset="12015177">And that is in the other 40 or somewhat parishes after the new test was -- was prescribe that all persons in all parishes were having to take the objective standard written examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.201" offset="12068780">So that now we have a situation where in 21 of the parishes that they are not required to take it but in the other they are required to take it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3089.510" offset="12358008">And thirdly, that we most specifically and most strongly oppose and ask this Court to recognize that the lower court went beyond its authority and beyond the record in issuing this injunction against the use of a valid state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.702" offset="12446720">Even under that statement of the lower court presume not only presumed to be valid but the courts has expressly says it is not at that time determining or passing on its validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.685" offset="12490710">And that therefore, if that statute is valid, the State has the right to use and then we must have been -- that right should be recognized in the injunction and to these 21 parishes desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.586" offset="12542328">And finally that the -- being a court of equity and this being an equitable proceeding that the -- that the class for whom this action was filed does have that remedy at large.</text>
