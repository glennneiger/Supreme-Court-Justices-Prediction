            <label>Mr. Frank I. Goodman</label>
            <text syncTime="12.312" offset="49215">Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.420" offset="77636">This case involving the validity of a search warrant is here on the government’s petition for certiorari from a decision of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.659" offset="122567">The respondent, Giacomo Ventresca, was tried by a jury under indictments charging him with possessing and operating an illegal distill and with conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.408" offset="177528">He was convicted on all accounts and sentenced to imprisonment for a total of three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.149" offset="204591">Both prior to the trial and again during the trial, the respondent moved unsuccessfully to the suppression of certain evidence, including the distilling apparatus itself, which the government had seized pursuant to a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.997" offset="267912">The First Circuit with one judge dissenting reversed the conviction on the ground that the affidavit submitted by the government in support of its application for the search warrant had failed to establish probable cause and the sole issue in this case is the legal sufficiency of that affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.143" offset="344503">The affidavit is found on pages 4 through 8 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.820" offset="367177">It was made by Walter Mazaka who was an investigator of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division of the Internal Revenue Service and I might point out here that an investigator is a regular full time agent of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.388" offset="445544">It is not to be confused with the so-called special employees on which the government sometimes relies, particularly in narcotics cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.403" offset="485564">The affidavit begins with the statement that the affiant has reason to believe that certain property including a distilling apparatus and other materials used in the manufacture of non tax-paid liquor are being concealed at a house occupied by Ventresca and his family at 148 1/2 Coburn Avenue in Worcester.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.285" offset="585038">The grounds for this belief are then set forth in considerable detail on a separate sheet which was prefaced by the following introductory paragraph and I read from page 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.080" offset="632268">“Based upon observations made by me and based upon information received officially from other investigators attached to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Divisions assigned to this investigation and reports orally made to me describing the results of their observations and investigation, this request for the issuance of a search warrant is made.”</text>
            <text syncTime="181.858" offset="727353">The affidavit then sets forth seven specific instances during the period July the 28th to August the 30th, 1961 in which a Pontiac automobile owned and operated by Joseph Garry who was a co-defendant in this case and having Joseph Incardone as its passenger stopped in the courtyard right in front of Ventresca’s house.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.010" offset="836023">On four of those occasions, the automobile was said to be -- said to be loaded with 60-pound sacks of sugar.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.463" offset="873848">On two other occasions, it was seen to carry large five gallon tin containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.376" offset="901433">On the seventh occasion, it was merely described as being heavily laden.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.617" offset="926407">In one instance, the affidavit specifically states that the automobile was followed between Boston and Worcester and in at least three other instances, it’s quite clear I think from the description of the movements of the automobile that the person who observed it had followed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.399" offset="993593">In one case, the affidavit states that these large metal containers were seen carried from the automobile into Ventresca’s house and similar containers, this time apparently filled with liquid, were later seen to be being loaded into the trunk of Garry’s car.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.156" offset="1080529">In two instances, at midnight and these on the same days in which the automobile had earlier been seen making these deliveries at Ventresca’s house, the car was seen to pull up in front of Garry’s house in a Boston suburb.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.750" offset="1146984">And on both of those occasions, either Garry or Incardone got out of the car, carried several metal containers apparently filled with liquid two by two into the house and none of the paragraphs which I’ve summarized so far said in so many words who it was who made the observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.088" offset="1240294">There were two other paragraphs however which did states specifically that the observations were made by investigators and these paragraphs stated that on August 18 and again on August the 30, 1961, investigators, while walking on the sidewalk in front of 148 Coburn Avenue which I gather is the house immediately adjacent to Ventresca’s, detected the odor of fermenting mash and on the latter occasion, that they heard sound similar to that of a motor or a pump coming from the direction of Ventresca’s house.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.106" offset="1388356">It was the day after the second of these two fermenting mash observations, that the government applied for and obtained a search warrant and it was the day after that that the search was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.815" offset="1447184">The affidavit concludes with the following statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.198" offset="1460767">“The foregoing information,” this is on page 8, “the foregoing information is based upon personal knowledge and information which has been obtained from investigators of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division, Internal Revenue Service who have been assigned to this investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.869" offset="1539448">Now we agree with the court below that in as much as Mazaka did not say specifically which of the statements in the affidavit were based on his own personal observations, it’s fair to evaluate the document on the assumption that all of the statements were based upon information which he received from his fellow officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.029" offset="1620114">That of course is merely the beginning of the inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="487.419" offset="1949675">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think you have in mind a different question which is the central question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.722" offset="1978828">All that I was saying is that his immediate informants, the affiant’s immediate informants were so called investigators with a capital I which is the more or less official even statutory name for full time agents of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.785" offset="2051135">Now what the affidavit does not state in so many words, and this I think is the central issue here, is how the investigators got their information, that is to say whether they got it from their own personal observations or whether they in turn gathered it from information given to them by other people who are not mentioned in the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.598" offset="2126367">That I think is the ultimate issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="536.361" offset="2145384">He said that it’s possible that it might have come from such unnamed and so far as it appears here unreliable sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.618" offset="2178403">In leading up to that issue, I just wanted to point out that in the Jones case this Court held that an affidavit which is based partly or even wholly on hearsay is not for that reason insufficient provided that there is a substantial basis for crediting that hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.303" offset="2245172">So the issue here is whether there’s a substantial basis for crediting the hearsay which we will assume the affidavit was based upon.</text>

            <text syncTime="1028.882" offset="4115435">The court below said though that since the affidavit does not say in so many words that these observations -- that the information received by the affiant is based upon observations of his fellow officers, but rather that it’s based on observations and investigation and since the word investigation is broad enough to include almost every imaginable means of obtaining information, the court below drew the conclusion or made the assumption that all of the informants, some or all of the information in the affidavit had been obtained by the other investigators from unnamed informants, unnamed outside informants, whose reliability does not appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.411" offset="4269558">At least the Court said the government hadn’t specifically, that the affidavit had not specifically negated that possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.458" offset="4297770">Now our position is essentially that that this reading of the affidavit by the Court of Appeals was all together unreasonable and that for at least three reasons, the decision should be reverse and our three reasons are these; each of them independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.122" offset="4360464">First, those observations which are described in the affidavit which were not specifically stated to have been made by investigators were the type of observations which could only have been made by investigators conducting a systematic month long surveillance of Ventresca’s house, Garry’s house in this Boston suburb and of the movements of the automobile as it moved between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.343" offset="4469342">Secondly, even if that not be true, even if the Court concludes that all of those paragraphs in the affidavit which do not specify the source of the observations are describing information obtained ultimately from an outside informant, still there are two paragraphs in the affidavit which do specifically say that the observations were made by investigators and these alone we submit are sufficient to establish probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.259" offset="4572996">And thirdly, even if that not be true, even if those two observations are not sufficient, they nonetheless serve to corroborate the other information set forth in the affidavit and to provide a substantial basis for crediting that information even if it be assumed to have come from some unidentified informant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.760" offset="4650945">Now with respect to the first point, that is to say that these observations could only have been made by the police investigators, I’d like to point out first that this is not just one or two casual instances which are described here, the sort of thing that some chance passerby might have seen and telephoned into the police or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.114" offset="4744359">Here, there are about 12 separate episodes described all taking place within one month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.891" offset="4767556">The affidavit specifically states that on at least two occasions, investigators were stationed outside Ventresca’s house at 4 o’clock in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.175" offset="4808620">In several instances, it’s clear that they followed an automobile between Boston and Worcester and back again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.803" offset="4831190">Now private people do not ordinarily follow automobiles from one city to another city no matter how suspicious or inquisitive they maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.767" offset="4863060">If they have suspicions, they usually call up the police and let the police do the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.692" offset="4890749">Nor is it I think reasonable to suppose on the basis of this affidavit, that any substantial part of this information could have come from some insider or some confederate, because it’s quite clear that the person who made the observations had no access to the interior of Ventresca’s house or to the interior of Garry’s house and in that regard, I’d like to read one paragraph to the Court from the affidavit which to me seems to epitomize the whole.</text>
