            <text syncTime="31.850" offset="127373">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.742" offset="142942">On August of 24th 1958, approximately 15 months after the illegal seizure, searches and seizure in the Mapp versus Ohio, petitioner was subjected to a series of illegal searches and seizures involving his home, his person and his place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.012" offset="219951">I believe that the State of Louisiana admits that these seizures were unconstitutional under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.129" offset="260493">Three weeks after these searches, he was charged with the crime which was wholly unrelated to the original search.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.409" offset="289541">He was convicted of this crime of burglary and sentenced to nine years in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.800" offset="331128">After his, the case of Mapp versus Ohio, the petitioner began a series of pro se habeas corpus petitions which finally ended in the opinion of the Fifth Circuit below.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.808" offset="387135">I believe that the State of Louisiana has conceded that he has exhausted his advantages by the opinion below and the issue presented in the opinion below was whether or not the rule of Mapp versus Ohio should be applied retroactively to effect prisoners whose convictions became final prior to the date of Mapp versus Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.257" offset="508970">Judge Reeves speaking for divided circuit hailed that Mapp would be applied prospectively and that the right not to be convicted on unconstitutionally seized evidence would not be accorded to Victor Linkletter because his conviction became final prior to the date of this Court's decision in Mapp.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.828" offset="607295">The opinion below was based perhaps on three premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.614" offset="622446">First that the purpose of the Mapp decision is deterrence and deterrence of illegal police action and this purpose can only be served or is mostly served by a prospective application of Mapp.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.737" offset="694857">The second premises of the Fifth Circuit's decision was that orderly judicial administration requires a prospective as opposed to retrospective application.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.515" offset="738011">And the third premise is that perhaps Mr. Linkletter and other prisoners who have been convicted on illegal seized evidence are in fact guilty and that the issue of fairness of the trial, that is the issue of guilt or innocence, his innocence is not before the Court and if this rule or constitutional right announced in Mapp should be given some sort of special treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.751" offset="858906">Now, we think that the opinion below is wrong on all three of these basic premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.208" offset="884820">The circuits as this Court knows are split now 4 to 2, 4 holding that Mapp versus Ohio should be fully retroactive, I mean sorry, prospective application and two holding that the Mapp rule should be given retrospective application to all prisoners.</text>

            <text syncTime="301.831" offset="1207275">By emphasizing the purpose of deterrence, the Fifth Circuit has obliterated the rule itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.214" offset="1240816">Now, we concede that deterrence is perhaps a purpose or is a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.203" offset="1264744">This Court in Mapp state that the purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter or to compel respect for the constitutional guarantee in the only effective available way by removing the (Inaudible) to disregard it as a quote from the Elkins decision, but this is not the sole and exclusive purpose of Mapp.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.924" offset="1343634">We submit that the rule of Mapp or the purposes of Mapp, other purposes are that this right not to be unconstitutionally convicted or convicted on unconstitutional evidence is reserved to all persons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1498.711" offset="5994789">The sole issue before this Court is whether or not a trial which has been final after and later a decision rendered, reversing a prior case upon which was the basis of the proceedings in the state court whether or not that later decision is to be applied retroactively, namely the Mapp case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.348" offset="6169391">The Lower Court held -- the Fifth Circuit held that the Mapp case is to be applied only prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.750" offset="6226965">The Court there set forth a rule which is respectfully urged by the State of Louisiana to this Court and that is when determining whether or not a new rule of law which previously overruled a decision on the same point, then we would look to three points in order to determine whether or not the new rule would be retroactive or be given retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.719" offset="6414838">The first being to attempt to identify the purpose for the new rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.117" offset="6440438">The second is to determine the balance of the purpose and to be sure -- to be served by the new rule and to decide whether or not this purpose would be promoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.808" offset="6511177">Prior to the Mapp decision this Court recognized the right to be free from illegal search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.147" offset="6560496">In the Wolf case this was so held, but at that time, the evidence that was to be introduced by the -- in the State Court proceedings, if obtained illegally, would not be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.375" offset="6653492">The Mapp case now recognizes the same rule that was set forth in Weeks which is applicable to the Federal Court in that evidence which is illegally obtained would be excluded in state court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.338" offset="6773342">The position was set forth by the state in its brief that the purpose for the Mapp decision is to give purpose to the right to be free from an illegal search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.484" offset="6857874">This right prior to Mapp was to be secured in other type of proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.948" offset="6911791">I assume at the time that civil proceedings could be brought against the officers who then made an illegal search and seizure, but at the time of the Mapp decision, this Court having recognized that right gave impetus to that right of freedom from an illegal search and seizure by barring the use of this evidence in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.653" offset="7130593">The primary contention or one of the primary contentions of the petitioner is that his act or his right to be secure from unlawful search and seizure occurred at a time which was after the illegal search in Mapp.</text>

            <text syncTime="1853.060" offset="7412193">The question would have to be determined in order to say whether or not this Court is applying it retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.790" offset="7463079">Any case that is final as of the date that the Mapp case was decided by this Honorable Court, would be one which we would have to say would be retroactive if so applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1913.277" offset="7653042">In as much as the case was totally finalized at the time that Mapp decision was offered by this Court or held by this Court, Linkletter had completely adjudicated his question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.586" offset="7758263">Now the question is what was the purpose for Mapp.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.637" offset="7790446">Mapp is to be given prospective application in order that there will be a deterrent against state offices from violating constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.693" offset="7846766">The purpose for this deterrent would be in no way served by holding Mapp retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.444" offset="7885740">I am quite sure that all of the courts, I know that the State of Louisiana is following Mapp and therefore the practice which the Court sought to bring to a conclusion or to finalize was in its decision format to hold that there is a deterrent to further stop the officers from this unlawful search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.448" offset="8081763">If there are no questions, I have relinquished some time to the amicus curiae which I will now turn over to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2166.826" offset="8667220">It seems to me that neither Mapp nor it's progeny were cases dealing with fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.608" offset="8698358">It seems to me that there is an essential distinction between those cases which effect the validity and reliability of the truth seeking process itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2234.551" offset="8938162">I submit that the right announced by the Fourth Amendment is the right which was applied to the states by Wolf against Colorado.</text>

            <text syncTime="2261.481" offset="9045891">Now that is a right which is a non court room right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.709" offset="9058743">That is a right which is violated before the judicial machinery that comes into play, and that is a right it seems to me, the violation of which cannot be remedied by retroactive application of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.049" offset="9120183">The exclusionary rule was adopted we submit as an enforcement device to secure this primary constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.512" offset="9170024">True it is itself a constitutional dimension, but it is not a right derived directly and independently from the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.841" offset="9211298">It seems to me as I read Wolf and Mapp that is Court after announcing the applicability of the primary right to privacy to the states, allowed the states an opportunity, very practically to develop if they could means for securing this right to the citizens of their jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2356.385" offset="9425502">In other words those tried before Mapp whose appeals are decided after Mapp get the benefit of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.305" offset="9453192">However where the normal appellate process has been exhausted, then a state prisoner who's only recourse is through the Federal Court is denied that right by the Second Circuit opinion reviewed in the companion case today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.343" offset="9521319">So that I think retroactivity is itself a matter of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.609" offset="9538351">It seems to me that retroactivity itself is not at all enough in proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.938" offset="9559667">Even in Jackson against Denno there was a modified sort of retroactivity imposed in as much as the judgment itself was allowed to remain assuming that a search for prejudice, post-judgment search for prejudice turned out to be negative.</text>

            <text syncTime="3690.080" offset="14760229">Mr. Uviller comes in and says that we are not contending that we are going to open the -- this decision retroactively is going to open the jail house doors, but in the same breath he says the courts will drown under the workload on flood of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.692" offset="14822713">I think that this is an attack upon the Mapp decision itself, not upon the retroactive application effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.659" offset="14854583">I think that this has been asked by this Court in the Gideon case, it's a speculative argument and is one that there is any legal writers on one side as is there are on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.606" offset="14906410">But I will point out this to the Court, it is simply impressive to me that our many states in which the retroactivity of Mapp has not be been decided and there are several circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.200" offset="14952699">They are now enough cases to get – and I think that this as valid as Mr. Uviller's opening the door arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.585" offset="14994286">The second point he makes is there is no unfairness in the trail based on illegalacies tangible evidence and again I want to point out to this Court that the trail would never have occurred under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.418" offset="15049665">It was a legal search because the evidence seized could not be seized under the search that was made against Mr. Linkletter, assuming a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.929" offset="15107657">This guilt or innocence argument, the fairness of the trial argument has been passed by this Court in coerced confession cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.599" offset="15138377">It has been held as an immaterial consideration in Rogers versus Richmond and Hayes versus Washington case and I could not see Mapp personally as an academic principle, but only as personal constitutional right which this Court has said should be applied to all individuals.</text>
