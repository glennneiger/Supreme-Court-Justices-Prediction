            <text syncTime="81.116" offset="324441">The third point that I intend to raise is the unconstitutionality under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of Section 190.1 of the constit -- of the Penal Code of the State of California which permits on the penalty issue of a criminal trial, a prosecution to bring in all kinds of matters, the horrors of the particular crime charged allowed them to bring in evidence from Mexico, allows them to go back into the history of the defendant and the great many things which I have nothing to do with the crime that is on trial in which I respectfully contend is in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="575.138" offset="2300552">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.886" offset="2303478">I'll come to that immediately then.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.504" offset="2313927">Here is what the prosecutor did then on this insufficient evidence and this is why I say that the Malloy case and the insufficient evidences that has a bearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.646" offset="2358544">The prosecutor argued page 605-A64 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.015" offset="2379964">It is my contention that if the defendant had not beaten, dragged or pushed and I don't mean dragged all the way down the alley.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.085" offset="2416327">I don't know what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.719" offset="2426776">He won't take the witness stand and tell you in this courtroom under oath what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.439" offset="2453734">Now, there are two things in that statement as I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.174" offset="2472647">First of all, he says he doesn't know what the defendant did.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.263" offset="2493022">He admits that the evidence is insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.989" offset="2503889">He wants to compel the defendant to take the witness stand and be -- have his testimony extorted from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.727" offset="2534818">Now, then he goes down and says a defendant has a constitutional right not to become a witness as -- in his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.836" offset="2567314">When the defendant does not become a witness there is no link, if there'd be a missing link in the People's case that is supplied by the defendant's failure to take the stand or -- and testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.936" offset="2611722">But if there are complete links but some of them are weak and the defendant would have the specific knowledge to explain or deny, then the failure of the defendant to explain or deny as a witness creates a situation in which the inference is unfavorable to the defendant are the more probable and the weak link if any.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.305" offset="2697195">Not the missing link, the weak link is strengthened.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.343" offset="2709316">The defendant certainly knows whether as he may have to speed up appearance at the time he left her apartment and went down the alley with her.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.449" offset="2745783">In other words, he says, “I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.106" offset="2756336">The prosecution's proof isn't sufficient.”</text>
            <text syncTime="691.709" offset="2766785">But he says if the defendant takes the witness stand -- if the defendant takes the witness stand then he can tell us what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.211" offset="2804820">So he now is trying to extort testimony by -- and argues to the jury that his failure to take the witness stand is an admission that these things that the prosecution has contended for were true.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.636" offset="2870544">Then he goes on and says, I'm still reading from page 605-A65 of the transcript, “What kind of a man is it that would want to have sex with a woman that beat up,” -- if she was beat up at the time that he left.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.103" offset="2936372">Now he doesn't know that she was beat up, he hasn't proved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.456" offset="2949747">But now he wants to extort that testimony or else he wants the jury to infer that those things occurred by the fact that the defendant did not take the witness stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="885.204" offset="3540741">And so, it is my contention here that this case is governed by Malloy versus Hogan and that this Court must reverse on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.251" offset="3588911">I want to urge one other point for Your Honor's strong consideration before I'm through.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.041" offset="3608137">But if Your Honors please, Malloy versus Hogan.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.804" offset="3623184">Is -- it takes the position and has been followed by this Court although the people of the State of California petitioned amicus curiae in the Malloy versus Hogan case and objected to this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.912" offset="3687549">The earlier case of Adamson versus California Your Honor in which Your Honor was concurred in by four justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.561" offset="3718165">Mr. Justice, your own strong dissent in that case certainly spells out the law as clearly as I could make it before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.740" offset="3766857">And I also want to call your attention to the argument to the dissent of Justice Murphy in that same opinion which I think presents my point as far as the law is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.164" offset="3824640">Mr. Justice Murphy said, "If a defendant does not take the stand, his silence is used as a basis for drawing unfavorable inferences against him as to matters that he might reasonably be expected to explain."</text>
            <text syncTime="972.988" offset="3891931">Thus he is compelled through his silence to testify against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.031" offset="3912098">And silence can be as effective in this situation as oral statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.587" offset="3934250">Second, if he does take the stand thereby opening himself to cross-examination so it's to overcome the effect of the provision and question is necessarily compelled to testify himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.397" offset="3981584">In that case, his testimony on a cross-examination is a result of coercive pressure of the provision rather than his own volition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.290" offset="4017110">This guarantee of freedom from self-incrimination is rounded on a deep respect for those who might prefer to remain silent from their accusers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.046" offset="4060160">Now Mr. Justice Goldberg in a -- in an opinion that came out about the same time as the -- this one did Murphy versus New York Waterfront stated that the right of self -- to be protected against self-incrimination was just as important as one of the fundamental safeguards of human beings and I have the citation here that I thought was important enough just to quote even the first paragraph, “The privilege against self incrimination registers an important advance in the development of our liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.337" offset="4237270">One of the great landmark that a man struggle to make himself civilized."</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.430" offset="4257646">And later you commented on the fact that the defendant can be whipsawed into incriminating himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.239" offset="4288888">And I want to say as a practicing lawyer, past president of our own Criminal Courts Bar that we stay awake at nights at the time we have to reach that crucial decision as to whether to put a defendant on the stand in California especially since 1934 or keep him off because we know the hazards and the use if we keep him off, we know that the prosecutor is going to make an argument that the failure of the defendant to take the witness stand is virtually an admission of his guilt and he makes this very dramatic argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.219" offset="4440816">He, ladies and gentlemen of the jury are asking you to do for him what he won't do himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.445" offset="4465685">He's asking you to come in with a verdict of not guilty but he won't take the witness stand and say that he is not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.046" offset="4492121">And it certainly whipsawing the defendant and to -- and using his right against self-incrimination as a sword instead of a shield that the constitution gave him the right to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.040" offset="4540082">Now I have one other point that I want to call to the attention of the Court and that this is a matter of bringing up this evidence from Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.088" offset="4576340">It was done on the county phase of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.085" offset="4588251">Time will not permit me to go into that because I want to reserve time for rebuttal if necessary but I do want to call Your Honors attention to the case that of Louisville -- of United States versus Oppenheimer in 242 U.S. at page 85 to page 88.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.448" offset="4673724">The safeguard provided by the constitution against the gravest abuses have intended to give impression that when it did not apply in terms there was no other principle that could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.321" offset="4721267">That was in using testimony from another country when there was a judgment of dismissal or acquittal in that country although there was the courts of California allowed the prosecutor to bring up witnesses from that country where the defense had no opportunity to bring them up and it was highly prejudicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.723" offset="4802873">In this Oppenheimer case, the Court says the Fifth Amendment was not contended to do away with what in civil law is the fundamental principle of justice in order that when a man once has been acquitted on the merits to enable the Government to prosecute him the second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.426" offset="4861701">I submit that this principle is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.795" offset="4875180">I'd like to reserve some time for further arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.948" offset="4887719">Have the Court any question in connection with the facts of the case or the self-incrimination features?</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.916" offset="4919589">I take it there are none, I will reserve time, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1610.974" offset="6443886">Now what the jury can do and what we say the Fifth Amendment permits a state to do, what the jury can do is consider his failure to explain or deny evidence that has been presented in open court against him on essential elements of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.979" offset="6515879">They're told that they may take into consideration his failure to deny or explain such evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.454" offset="6585783">And they're told that among the inferences that may be available from that evidence and from all evidencethere are various inferences that can be drawn those unfavorable to the defendant or are more probable than the others.</text>

            <text syncTime="2819.175" offset="11276643">I don't think any prosecutor could honestly say that this rule is helpful to defendants, it maybe but it's not on the constitution for that reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="2845.778" offset="11383014">Mr. Justice Brennan in his dissenting opinion in Cohen against Hurley at page 159 noted that neither Twining or Adamson which involves comment rules -- that neither of those cases involved the question here presented of the constitutionality of a penalty visited by a state upon a citizen for invoking the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.059" offset="11472144">Both involved only the much narrower question whether comment was constitutionally permissible.</text>

            <text syncTime="2911.740" offset="11646955">And a little later on in this argument he says if anybody -- now Mr. Maple made some comment, Mr. Maple was the defendant -- defense attorney, made some comment about Dr. Noguchi and he is saying some of these injuries or damages could have been caused by dragging.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.185" offset="11724696">That is Dr. Noguchi's opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2946.689" offset="11786658">Mr. Maple made a remark about the statement that (Inaudible) and therefore the defendant doesn't have to take the stand to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.081" offset="11816229">He has already reminded you, told you his story.</text>

            <text syncTime="2965.954" offset="11863771">And then there's further discussion about his not taking the stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="2976.242" offset="11904940">She was not dead when this man came along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.620" offset="11918420">She was taken to the receiving hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.996" offset="11927928">She gave the officers her name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.186" offset="11936705">There was no further conversation at least recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.184" offset="11948722">She died of the subdural hematoma which was the result of a doctor's operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.719" offset="11974844">She did not die of any rape or any attempted rape nor of a subdural hematoma that occurred prior to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.509" offset="12009953">The prosecutor made his argument and pointed out that the subdural hematoma that she had which was a filling of the blood in the head was not the one that caused her death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.411" offset="12053629">Her death was caused by the operation of the Doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.844" offset="12067318">I merely point those out to correct some of the facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.898" offset="12079543">Now, in connection with the opinion in the Modesto case, I may have had some slight responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.882" offset="12111517">I was before the Supreme Court of California, Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.209" offset="12128758">A few weeks ago before the Modesto case came down I told some of the members of the Court I was coming here to argue this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.186" offset="12156656">I know that as you did that they reversed the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.303" offset="12169195">Then they spent several pages discussing Malloy versus Hogan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.345" offset="12185287">Now there's an excellent dissent in that case by Justice Peters and one in the paragraph, one sentence that I would like to read to the Court in which he says that the majority -- says that the majority concludes that the no comment rule doesn't do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.448" offset="12261773">That is to assert that the 1934 Amendment accomplishes nothing at all whether to accomplish a great deal because as will be later pointed out it was necessary to pass it in order to change the then existing California law which prohibited any comment at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.582" offset="12330318">And Justice Peters goes on to point out in his dissenting opinion by -- an argument that I would like to take time to read but don't have the time to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.158" offset="12368562">I would like to point out one other thing that this opinion points out also that the rule of the Twining case was reversed by and has ceased to be the law in New Jersey in State versus Murphy 1964 at 204 A.2d 888.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.398" offset="12437525">I did not cite this in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.814" offset="12447242">Now, if Your Honors please, the Adamson case is not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.328" offset="12477231">The Twining case was a case that passed on direct evidence of some -- in a bank case, it was a misdemeanor case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.070" offset="12512235">The question that came up was not under the Fifth Amendment, was under the privileges and immunities of citizens which the Court held was not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.895" offset="12551523">Later on they discussed due process but did not discuss it directly with relation to the Fifth Amendment and I again call your attention to the dissenting opinion and to the very able opinions of Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Murphy in the Adamson case.</text>
