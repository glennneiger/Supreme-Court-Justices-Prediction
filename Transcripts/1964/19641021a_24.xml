            <text syncTime="36.921" offset="253278">We appeal from two convictions in Number 24 and one in Number 49.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.590" offset="279923">However, we have submitted consolidated -- a consolidated brief in those three situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.512" offset="307613">In 24, we appeal from a -- in affirmance of a conviction pursuant to Louisiana Revised Statute 14.100.1 obstructing the sidewalks and -- for which Cox received a sentence of five months, $500 or an additional five months in lieu thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.387" offset="407087">In addition, we appeal under 14.103.1 for breach of the peace for which Cox received four months, $200 or an additional four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.087" offset="461944">Both 24 and 49 arise from a single incident, a single demonstration which I will attempt to describe in a moment, and the same facts are available to all three convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.085" offset="525892">Other aspects of this very same case have previously been before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.323" offset="550865">In Clem -- excuse me, in Clemmons against CORE, where this Court denied certiorari, 375 U.S. 992, the same factual basis was involved precisely except there was another issue and this Court has previously denied cert -- but the facts apply precisely to this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="144.283" offset="682731">However, Clemmons against CORE, it is exactly the same facts, nothing different whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.372" offset="711048">We appealed and this Court noted probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.300" offset="730796">On December 14th, 1961, 23 youngsters were arrested for peaceful picketing in downtown Baton Rouge.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.380" offset="771130">The purpose of that picketing was to protest against the discrimination of Negroes and the segregation of Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.070" offset="805820">On December 15th, Southern University students, and Southern University is a few miles outside of the City of Baton Rouge, began a -- to hold a demonstration and decided to make a protest against the arrest of these 23 and to protest the segregation and discrimination that existed in Baton Rouge at the time by coming in to Baton Rouge to point out their protest, and by various means some on foot, some by auto, some by bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.437" offset="943329">They arrived a couple of blocks from the scene of the incidence which we are concerned with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.909" offset="969242">And approx -- at some point shortly or about noon time of that day, they were met by the Chief of Police, Mr. Wingate White, and by the Sheriff, Mr. Clemmons of Clemmons against CORE and by the mayor and one or two others.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.230" offset="1046460">Mr. Cox at this point, the appellant here, met these honored gentlemen and they discussed the event that was about to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.237" offset="1090555">And Cox advised them they were going to have some songs, some prayers and he would make a short speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.747" offset="1120543">He was directed to hold his demonstration on the west side of the street, approximately 103 feet from the courthouse and on the opposite side of the sidewalk from -- adjourned the courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.932" offset="1201314">And this meeting then went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.279" offset="1218659">Pursuant to his instructions by the Chief of Police and the Sheriff to meet on the west side, that is the side away from the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.169" offset="1254290">At this very moment of course, the 2000 people approximately, were visible to the police and to the Sheriff and to the mayor and everybody knew it was approximately noon time.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.354" offset="1302983">So the question of the time, the place and the numbers were known to everybody and in a sense a contract, if you will permit me to use the word.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.909" offset="1549265">The state's position is that Cox had agreed to a seven-minute meeting.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="364.152" offset="1562222">That's correct.</text>

          <turn speaker="carl_rachlin" startTime="364.661" stopTime="677.259">
            <label>Mr. Carl Rachlin</label>
            <text syncTime="364.661" offset="1564207">There as we say, that the facts in the record do not bear that out, that the trial judge makes no reference to these seven minutes whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.734" offset="1596494">As a matter of fact, if you'll permit me sir, when Cox made his speech and taking the liberty of a minister and I don't doubt he spoke perhaps a little longer and we lawyers perhaps shouldn't complain about the use of speech by a minister.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.206" offset="1662427">But nevertheless, Cox spoke and there was no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.297" offset="1682803">And I now read from page 354 of the record before us, when Cox said, and then he came to a point, “It's now noon time, you must be hungry, why don't you go sit down and demand to be fed”, referring to the restaurants in downtown Baton Rouge.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.550" offset="1771828">It must be kept in mind Your Honor that four days before, Garner was decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.490" offset="1799518">And Garner was a Baton Rouge case.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.084" offset="1809967">And as a matter of fact, some of the very attorneys who appeared in Garner appear in the very case before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.038" offset="1833686">Now at that point, and I now quote precisely from the Sheriff's testimony, I'd -- I have a few and you recall there was -- at the moment Cox said, “Let's go have lunch”, the Sheriff Clemmons says, “I grabbed a power microphone.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.105" offset="1890006">I didn't grab -- Sergeant Ryprech was standing by and I took this power microphone and I said, "Now, you have been allowed to demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.401" offset="1927205">Up until now, your demonstration has been more or less peaceful, but what you are doing now is a direct violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.256" offset="1970568">A disturbance of the peace and has -- it has got to be broken up immediately.”</text>
            <text syncTime="472.113" offset="1994078">It was -- and this testimony is confirmed by Chief Justice White -- excuse me sir, by the Police Chief White who, it says precisely the same thing on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.443" offset="2047368">There is -- in other words, there is actually no doubt that the moment the meeting was broken up was the moment that Cox said, “Let's have lunch” referring to presumably attempt to be fed at the various restaurants in downtown Baton Rouge.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.616" offset="2116018">At this point, the Sheriff comes forward, he makes a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.699" offset="2136393">We have another conflict of testimony in which it is claimed that Cox has said, “Don't move” after the Sheriff has said “break up the meeting”.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.602" offset="2188011">I might add parenthetically, when the Sheriff said, “move on” it is hard to understand, and I don't mean to criticize from this point of view, but nevertheless looking back at it when you have 2000 people packed on a sidewalk, ten feet wide, by approximately 200 feet long and you say, “move on” with a crowd of perhaps -- people interested -- spectators across the street, they're little difficult to understand what move on means.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.399" offset="2299188">And move on might have created more chaos than if the Sheriff had said, for example, “Move on to the south, move on to the north, everybody out of the square.”</text>
            <text syncTime="559.340" offset="2342970">He says, “move on” and never says which direction to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.683" offset="2356344">And we could've had real chaos if the order in fact was obeyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.736" offset="2372540">Well, whether Cox or did or did not say, “don't move”, three witnesses heard him say some variation of that and five witnesses heard him say actually nothing on the subject whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.598" offset="2419978">And the trial court makes no mention of this whatsoever, within approximately 40 seconds to a minute, the time very slightly from witness to witness, off go the teargas and then other chaos was created unnaturally.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.355" offset="2486956">But in any event, Cox is not arrested that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.276" offset="2506705">He's arrested the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.599" offset="2511930">The why, this was never been satisfactorily explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.459" offset="2523423">He was arrested the next day for the three crimes of which I have mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.399" offset="2551218">At -- in any event, I would like to be -- its interesting to note, it is interesting to note that in the justices -- in the trial court judge's opinion below, he cites as his reason for deciding the case this way, and I read from page 10 (a) of the appendix, the very bottom of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.296" offset="2678800">It must be recognized to be inherently dangerous and a breach of a peace to bring 1500 people, colored people, down in the predominantly white business district in the City of Baton Rouge and congregate across the street from the courthouse and sing songs as described to me by the defendant as the CORE national anthem carrying lines such as “both black and white together” and to urge those 1500 people to descend upon our lunch counters and sit there until they are served.</text>
