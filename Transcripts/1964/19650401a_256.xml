            <text syncTime="2138.492" offset="8553953">So are we going to adopt the rule in Texas and Colorado, the rule in Texas and Colorado and apply it to federal courts and to all the other 48 states of the union and say, you've got to lock your juries up because they might watch television.</text>

            <text syncTime="2168.233" offset="8672862">I know as early as 1951, Judge Arnold wrote an article in Atlantic Monthly in which he watched the Costello hearing and he said that public trial doesn't mean that the trail can be used as an instrument for publicity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2409.717" offset="9638766">That's not the decision that a lawyer makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.234" offset="9648901">A lawyer -- it's the appearance to ethics of his profession Your Honor that enables a lawyer to form a foundation upon which he can evaluate his service to his client and if he violates those ethics, that's accepted by the bar association to which he belongs, then he makes it impossible for himself to judge himself as competent counsel for his client.</text>

            <text syncTime="2462.026" offset="9848059">Now that is a serious question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.318" offset="9861224">Now, I think that this isn't an interference with federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.935" offset="9899677">Justice Stewart said that sound federalism, I may not repeat it exactly, seeks to get uniformity and not conflict between the state and the federal systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.411" offset="9965610">Judge Frankfurter said that this Court doesn't sit here to impose the federal rules on state courts and I recognize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.940" offset="10003749">But here, we have a rule not Canon 35 but a standard of conduct in the courtroom which is accepted by 48 states and even in Texas and Colorado, is accepted in all but the trial courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.010" offset="10083997">I say that true federalism is better served by a uniform rule such as the Court adopted in Gideon versus Wainwright rather than leaving to every case in Texas and Colorado, a determination by the Federal Court either this Court or another Federal Court whether or not there was really prejudice in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.297" offset="10185143">When you can prohibit the prejudice by providing a rule that will require Texas and Colorado to comply with the other 48 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.093" offset="10236343">Then there is no other effective way of controlling television or preventing what has occurred so many times when courts have tried to control it by rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.941" offset="10315755">Of course this Court has held you can't do it by contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.782" offset="10347102">Canon 28 of Texas says that the judges had gone together and agreed that they will fix certain rules for televising and that if anybody violates that rule or criticizes it in an editorial, then the judge shall fine that person for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.621" offset="10414393">I don't think that violates antitrust law, but it at least is going [Attempt to Laughter] to be difficult to get this Court to sustain a contempt for a newspaperman that says, “Well, I don't like this rule that this judge has provided in his court about the television.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.476" offset="10485864">You can't do it by inter-media and Bar Association cooperation, because the media just doesn't think that they should be restrained from saying what they please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.681" offset="10558694">And they have the right under the First Amendment to say what they think and please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.798" offset="10579174">So, the only practical way of insuring a fair trial is a uniformity of rule which would prohibit television.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.943" offset="10623687">Now on the question of whether it interferes with freedom of the press and freedom of speech, the Valente case, and Even cases held that the freedom of speech doesn't include the right to discover things and I don't entirely agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.150" offset="10708532">I think that if you just have the right to talk but don't have the right to find out some it would be disgusting and [Inaudible].</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.054" offset="10748134">And in the same way, the Sixth Amendment doesn't say that anybody but the defendants should be entitled a public trial, but that doesn't mean that the public can't come and watch the trial, but it doesn't mean that you've got to make it possible for the whole world to hear about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.062" offset="10820232">And the distinguished Attorney General of Texas is eminent trial counsel, Assistant District Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.867" offset="10863386">I do not believe or take the position that public trial means make it possible for just as many people as possible to hear it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2799.128" offset="11196500">And I think that in determining that if it's not a matter of just procedure, but it's a matter which may affect the fairness of the trial, that the attorney gets into possession that I have seen recently reported to by opinion of our Circuit and I don't pass on correctness of this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.701" offset="11314782">It was decided by en banc in the Fifth Circuit that the attorney for the government could not be required against his conscience to sign indictment or prepare an indictment had been returned by grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.791" offset="11799092">They were shown parts that somebody not sworn had monitored and picked out and put in this two-hour broadcast and they were passing on in advance, is this man is guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.286" offset="11849143">Just the press can do that Your Honor, but they have a right to do it, but you have the right to object to a thing so broadly done as it's done with TV.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.747" offset="11906926">The educational purposes of television and even the press are incidental and the television is not equipped to do it fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.180" offset="11948617">It cost too much money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.750" offset="11958962">Probably only five or six cases a year are televised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.560" offset="11978188">They're not televised unless they are famous defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.139" offset="11996473">They can't spend have 15 men in attendance as the record shows they had here and spend $150,000 in the ordinary case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.691" offset="12038687">So, the television itself is not equipped to do what these people say we want to do and the lawyer knows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.628" offset="12082469">It's recent, it's a matter of public knowledge and it's recent as this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.872" offset="12103471">There was a complete report of about how he misstated his liabilities to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.917" offset="12127608">They put it in full for two days of the testimony of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.793" offset="12143073">The defendant for the first time went on the trial and gave his case and told the newspapers didn't mention and Dallas didn't mention the case that day, they just ignored it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.471" offset="12201796">One of the paper over in Fort Worth said that this was the first time he'd be on the stand in the three cases and two of which he'd been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.063" offset="12244219">The court was required to call in all the jurors, they were not sequestered in the Federal Court and ask each one of them, did you read this article about him not -- but they didn't tell what it was, but what they've said that he had not testified in any other case, his reference to his exercise of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.210" offset="12316839">Of course, the jury said they hadn't read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.638" offset="12330527">So the court sent the -- they didn't discharge the jury and the jury went out after the argument and acquitted Mr. Estes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.178" offset="12372637">But are we going to permit the television to broadcast as a trial they see so that the Court will have to come in and interrogate the jurors or lock them up, interrogate him as they did in our -- in the Kopitch case and the cases where the cases were reversed because the judge didn't interrogate the juror and asked them about what they heard or what they saw on television.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.611" offset="12482351">So, the only practical means of enforcing this rule of fair trial and a standard of procedure is by extending it to Texas and Colorado and create a uniformity in the treatment of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.092" offset="12588304">Now, it's not going to be a great amount of infringement upon freedom of speech since the case is due to any other state except Texas and Colorado anyways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.386" offset="12625502">It's not going to infringe freedom of speech and say, “well now, you can't do it in Texas and you can't do it in Colorado.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.357" offset="12661342">That's not going to hurt freedom of speech and freedom of press.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.481" offset="12681822">I think the part that is overlooked, the experiments suggested here by the defendant, the empirical approach, let the bench, bar and media try out some cases or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.149" offset="12740545">Well, if they will just say let the defendant be a part of that and determine whether or not he wanted to be experimented on, then there would be no serious objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.180" offset="12792686">It would violate my sense of propriety, but I'm not always sure that I'm right on my adherence to Canon 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.712" offset="12866769">Your Honor, I'll proceed -- I will not proceed further now, but my associate will use the few minutes we have left in rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3264.885" offset="13059448">Now we're willing to be judged on the facts, but we certainly want the facts well known.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.892" offset="13079510">May I pull one fact out of context here due to the questions placed from the bench today and make it clear to the Court that no part of the testimony of any witness was recorded, no part of it was ever recorded and that none of it was recorded for later playback during the trial, the broadcast people, the radio people voir dire if they so desire sit in the audience, take notes, go out and make comments on later broadcast.</text>

            <text syncTime="3799.852" offset="15199399">Now, the trial court permitted live telecast of the pretrial proceedings on these two motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.857" offset="15231373">However, there was not any evidence nor was there any testimony offered on the merits of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3826.935" offset="15307651">There was no testimony offered on the motion for a continuance other than the mere calling of the witnesses' names and the filing of the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.311" offset="15349238">I would like to point out to this Court that practically all of the complaints heard from counsel or the petitioner and various of the amici curiae briefs are related to this pretrial hearing before the judge, which determined only those two matters of procedure and the preliminary matters did not in any manner include any evidence or even any statement by counsel as to the pertinent facts in the case since it was not to be tried at this particular time nor was any comment made as to the guilt or the innocence of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.539" offset="15498136">Now, I would like to specifically point out to this Court's attention that on page 63 of the record, you will find testimony by Mr. Hume Cofer, co-counsel for the petitioner, concerning the petitioner's objection to the presence of cameras in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.518" offset="15578070">Mr. Cofer expressly admitted under oath at that time that this televised pretrial hearing gave no prospective juror any knowledge about the facts of this case nor any knowledge of any of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.277" offset="15645048">This was under oath by Mr. Cofer himself, page 63 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.401" offset="15665528">The record bears out also that Judge Dunagan's statement, who was the trial judge, which appears on page 106 of the record filed herein that “prospective jurors and others in the Smith County or any other place did not learn anymore than they already knew and they didn't learn anymore from the TV and radio and they had learned from the press which was that the defendant had been brought to Smith County for trial, that the trial was called or the case was called rather, that the defendant had filed a motion to exclude cameras, that he had filed a motion for continuance and that the witnesses' names were recalled and the numbers were missing.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4278.982" offset="17115847">Now on the 23rd, the judge calls to be placed in this aperture a further closing of it, because he found that the cameras could operate there, all right, and still he could close off any activity that might be behind the wall of the booth so as to be sure or surer that nothing occurred that would prevent a fair trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="5455.271" offset="21821022">It is his responsibility to keep the press under reasonable control to keep spectators under reasonable control and similarly, he should exercise a responsibility of keeping television under responsible control.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leon Jaworski</label>
            <text syncTime="5508.165" offset="22032614">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5514.511" offset="22058005">I appear in this case at the request of and by appointment of the Attorney General of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5522.781" offset="22091024">In so doing, I am advocating a position in this case which is in considerable conflict with that supported by the brethren of mine with whom I have labored in the vineyard of the American Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.404" offset="22153613">The Court is aware of course of the filing of an amicus curiae brief by the American Bar in this case and also the acknowledgment that petitioner has made in his brief of the assistance that was rendered by members interested in Canon 35 in the preparation of petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5560.404" offset="22241593">I do not for a moment question the earnestness of purpose or the sincerity of those very fine and eminent counsels who are contending in their brief as they are that Canon 35 should be accepted as a constitutional standard, but I do feel that the advocating of this principle has with it much danger and I think that it is unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="5595.182" offset="22380669">Now because when the writ of certiorari was granted, it was granted on a point that has Canon 35 enmeshed in it being set in the point that Canon 35 should be adopted and accepted as a rule of trial procedure and that unless it is so done, there is denial due process of law I would like to review with the court very briefly the history of Canon 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="5626.968" offset="22507833">I think when we bear this history in mind we see that actually what it is, no more than the statement of ethical standards of conduct, merely a statement of the exemplary conduct should be followed by courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5645.354" offset="22581394">But I think it's of particular significance that the very -- on the very last occasion that the American Bar Association dealt with Canon 35 at a time when it had its midwinter meeting in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="5664.584" offset="22658299">At that time, it very definitely announced its appraisal of Canon 35, an appraisal and a standing that we're willing to adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.448" offset="22717753">It is our view that at that time, this Canon was correctly elevated to the place where it belonged so far as it being a standard of conduct is concerned but we feel that the position now taken which is far different from that, that it becomes a constitutional standard of conduct is a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="5703.961" offset="22815765">Now may I direct the Court's attention to the wording of the resolution of the American Bar Association passed in 1963, the last time that this Association dealt for this Canon.</text>

            <text syncTime="5722.871" offset="22891416">It's at the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5730.480" offset="22921822">Yes sir, it's on page 5 under summary of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5737.198" offset="22948780">The Canons of Professional Ethics and the Canons of Judicial Ethics as adopted by the American Bar Association, constitute the standards of policy recommended by the American Bar Association for the consideration and voluntary guidance of the rule making authorities of the states of United States and have a force of law only where voluntarily adopted and incorporated in state laws or as a rule of Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5765.842" offset="23063301">We recommend that the rule-making authority of each state exercise the exclusive responsibility of adopting Canons of ethics in the interest of statewide uniformity and avoidance of confusion and pressures that have resulted in some jurisdictions where magistrates or judges have individually adopted rules concerning the conduct of their courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5785.662" offset="23142609">Now this was a recommendation made by the committee that have been studying this matter and this recommendation was adopted by the House of Delegates and following the adoption of this resolution, the committee that had been dealing with Canon 35 was discharged and this is the last time that the American Bar Association officially dealt with this Canon.</text>
            <text syncTime="5808.427" offset="23233620">I would like to briefly comment on the history of Canon 35 even before this last action occurred because I think it's very significant in showing what its true purpose was.</text>
            <text syncTime="5818.834" offset="23275311">The very first of the Canon's of Judicial Ethics were adopted in 1924.</text>
            <text syncTime="5825.545" offset="23302165">At that time, there was no Canon 35, there were 34 Canons at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5830.667" offset="23322645">In 1937, Canon 35 was adopted for the first time it read differently at that time than it does now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5838.077" offset="23352216">It placed its emphasis upon matters that are far different from what is argued now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5844.043" offset="23376144">It placed its emphasis upon the dignity and the decorum in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="5849.877" offset="23399445">It placed emphasis upon the fact that photography and broadcasting and that's all it referred to at that time were degrading to the court, and that it placed its emphasis upon the statement that photography and broadcasting should not be permitted because of the misconceptions that might be left for the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="5871.484" offset="23485858">Now the Canon was then amended in 1952, and at that time, again there were these things stressed by the Canon.</text>
            <text syncTime="5884.508" offset="23537998">First, dignity and decorum, again degrading of the court, creating misconceptions in the minds of the public, but for the first time that was included televising and it was then said that these elements, these factors, the televising, photography and broadcasting are calculated to detract the witness in giving his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5913.826" offset="23655236">The last amendment to Canon 35 was made at this time that I have mentioned to the Court a few minutes ago, in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="5921.977" offset="23687837">It was made after this case was tried in the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5926.363" offset="23705391">And at that time, we find that the part of Canon 35, that related to the degrading of the court had been dropped and so after these many years of experience, after this many years of insisting that photographing and broadcasting were degrading to the court, the American Bar Association changed its mind and dropped that from the Canon, but in order to under guard it and because there was included a change an amendment, a further amendment which said that instead of calculated to distract the witness that it is calculated to distract that it is -- that it does distract witnesses, distract witnesses and participants but that was the last change that was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5975.927" offset="23903608">Now again, if we go back to the preamble about Canons of Ethics as to what the entire purpose was, we see that the preamble states too in matter entirely consistent with what was said by the American Bar Association as late as 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="5993.196" offset="23972780">We find that it says that the Association adopts the following Canons, the spirit of which it suggests as a proper guide and reminder for judges and is indicating what the people have a right to expect from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6008.929" offset="24035683">Now there are a number of Canons.</text>
            <text syncTime="6012.065" offset="24048222">Canon 35 is before the Court but why should Canon 35 be singled out as one that sets forth constitutional standards and none of the other Canons.</text>
            <text syncTime="6022.604" offset="24090331">We have situations where there can be an abuse of Canon 35 that obviously affect in our thinking the constitutional rights of a defendant, but that can be true with respect to spectators.</text>
            <text syncTime="6036.011" offset="24144039">It can be true with respect to the press, it can be true with respect to television.</text>
            <text syncTime="6040.949" offset="24163788">Other Canons are in exactly the same situation and if a Canon 5 for instance which deals with impatience and intemperateness on the part of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.791" offset="24211122">Now that could seriously affect the fairness of the accused trial, but doesn't necessarily do so simply because a judge has made some intemperate remarks or has shown some impatience.</text>
            <text syncTime="6063.476" offset="24253858">Does it per se mean that because that Canon has been violated that there has been a denial of due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="6090.125" offset="24360438">The question of whether there has been any unfairness here is something that has to be looked at on a basis of its own factual situation and my comments to the Court are being made simply in response to what the petitioner has been arguing when he says, the mere fact that there has been a television camera in the courtroom and that's what it amounts to that there has been prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6113.395" offset="24453538">And in making that sort of a contention what is actually happening here is that the principles that this Court has announced on a number of occasions are being swept aside because so far as I know, I haven't found a single case where this Court has ever said that it is going to be presumed that there was a denial of due process of law, that there is going to be a presumption that the defendant has been denied a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6142.413" offset="24569626">I know that this Court has said just the contrary in a number of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="6920.625" offset="27682482">The defendant's case does not depend upon the proposition that the constitution prevents TV.</text>
            <text syncTime="6927.565" offset="27710171">The defendant's case depends upon proposition that the defendant has the right to object to a process which has no judicial function and which will probably prejudice it and to that where that process has no judicial function, he, the defendant ought to be entitled to have some say about whether or not it is utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="6951.284" offset="27805048">Now there are two or three things that I must cover about the facts that I do want to cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="6956.222" offset="27824797">First, there was a question about when the defendant arrived in September, the defendant arrived early in the morning in the courtroom of September the 24th only 15 or 20 or 30 minutes after the proceedings began prior to the arrival of the defendant -- the defendant's counsel only stated their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6976.558" offset="27906194">All of the testimony on the September the 24th and 25th was taken in the presence of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6984.194" offset="27936705">This is not the way the courtroom appeared in September.</text>
            <text syncTime="6987.424" offset="27949662">The way the courtroom appeared in September is shown by the photographs, 8/10 photographs, the shiny ones, which show the cameras in the microphones and that one microphone that's not shown and it's this one that was protruding across the edge of the jury box at this point, the directional microphone which was capable of picking up counsel and the defendant's conversations at this table, the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="7014.970" offset="28059794">The record shows that there was sound being taped in October.</text>
            <text syncTime="7023.498" offset="28093962">Both radio reporters testified on pages 99 and pages 101 of the record that at the October hearing, they were tape recording that portion of the October proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="7039.630" offset="28158433">The broadcast of that sound had been prohibited and the reporters testified that it was not being recorded for the purpose of rebroadcast but it was available for rebroadcast and that sound was being recorded in October by the radio facilities as shown on pages 99 and 101 of the record.</text>
