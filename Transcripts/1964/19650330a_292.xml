            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">Number 292, the Atlantic Refining Company, Petitioner versus Federal Trade Commission and number 296, the Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company versus Federal Trade Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.579" offset="86309">Mr. Ballard, you may proceed with your argument.</text>

          <turn speaker="frederic_l_ballard" startTime="26.648" stopTime="318.132">
            <label>Mr. Frederic L. Ballard, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="26.648" offset="106580">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.630" offset="118491">This is a proceeding under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.809" offset="139180">The principle issue for the Court at this stage in the proceeding is the legality of a contract between the Atlantic Refining Company, an oil company, and the Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company, which is a maker of tires, tubes, and other rubber products.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.079" offset="220264">Under this contract, Atlantic promotes the sale of Goodyear tires and batteries, and accessories, automotive accessories, which are called TBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.151" offset="276584">They referred to in the proceedings and in the industry as TBA standing for tires, batteries, and accessories.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.543" offset="306155">Atlantic promotes the sale of these articles through the service stations which handle Atlantic gasoline and this is Atlantic's part of the bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.830" offset="359236">Goodyear's part of the bargain is to pay Atlantic a commission for these services.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.895" offset="383478">The Trade Commission issued a complaint charging that this sales and commission contract is an unfair method of competition within the meaning of Section 5 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.256" offset="436976">The examiner for the Federal Trade Commission after extensive hearings, upheld the legality of the contract, but he found that Atlantic had coerced its dealers to buy TBA, and he entered an order to prohibit that coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.038" offset="524121">This order in substance was affirmed by the Commission and it was also affirmed by the Court of Appeals from the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.117" offset="576366">Now Atlantic has not sought a further review of this portion of the order and this is the first point Your Honors that I would like to stress because it's a very important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.831" offset="623282">As this case was presented to the Trade Commission, and as it was presented to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the issue of coercion was not only in the case, but it dominated the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.179" offset="676676">This was as the Trade Commission saw it, and that the Seventh Circuit saw it, a coercion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.756" offset="710949">Now if Your Honors please, we took vigorous exception to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.864" offset="727353">We felt that the evidence did not support these findings, but having lost that issue before the Commission and having lost it again before the Seventh Circuit, we do not press it here and we accept the sections of the Commission's order which are designed broadly, sweepingly to prohibit and eliminate coercion and to guarantee to our dealers their freedom of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.733" offset="838844">Now Your Honors, we believe that that should have been the answer to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.673" offset="862668">We believe that once you are given -- once the fact of coercion is approved or accepted, that the hearing examiner was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.215" offset="904777">The correct disposition of the case was an order against coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.307" offset="933198">This would have taken care of the competitive evil which was uppermost in the mind of the Commission and we know it was uppermost in the mind of the Commission Your Honors, because the great bulk of the testimony in this case was from dealer witnesses and actually ex-dealer witnesses who complained that that they had been forced by various methods of coercion, some sophisticated, some more open to buy Goodyear TBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.632" offset="1078439">And the remainder of the bulk of the testimony was from independents so-called independent wholesalers of TBA, people who called on these dealers from time to time and who complained that they found it extremely difficult if not to impossible to sell to the dealers and that they felt that the dealers were required to buy the TBA that Atlantic was promoting, that the dealers themselves felt this and that therefore they were foreclosed in the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.274" offset="1205081">Now Your Honors, we believe that this was the heart of the Commission's case, this notion of foreclosure, this notion of coercion, and it would be completely cured by the two paragraphs of the order which are not before this Court because we have accepted it.</text>

            <text syncTime="545.031" offset="2180075">Actually Your Honor, we believe they were free before the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.768" offset="2191047">That's why we - that's why we carried it to the Seventh Circuit, but we've lost that question in the case and we don't intend to argue it again here, if Your Honor please.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.636" offset="2230544">Now let's see what the Commission did, because the Commission did not do as I have said they should have done and stopped at the same point the examiner did.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.495" offset="2265966">The exa -- the Commission went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.616" offset="2278400">They said that the method by which the TBA was reaching the dealers was itself illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.997" offset="2303896">In other words, they say the contract between Atlantic and Goodyear was illegal and this you will recall was a sales commission contract and they said they issued four paragraphs which read together abolished and actually they recognized, the word abolition appears in their opinion, they recognized that they were abolishing the sales commission plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="606.637" offset="2426462">Atlantic agreed Your Honor, to promote the sale of Goodyear TBA through its dealers and through the dealers to the motoring public.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.001" offset="2475990">Because Your Honor will see that there is no point in promoting a tire to a dealer unless you help them to sell it on to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.716" offset="2506815">Now, in order to understand what the Commission did here, you have to recognize that they did not prevent Atlantic from having a TBA program.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.450" offset="2561776">They put an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.125" offset="2568464">They said that Atlantic cannot promote and it cannot assist the dealers except where Atlantic itself is the distributor or the marketer.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.783" offset="2619037">Now this is a very curious exception which can only be understood against the background of TBA distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.210" offset="2672744">The fact of the matter is and it's not in their dispute at all, that TBA is essential to service station operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.289" offset="2713078">Your Honors have only to check their personal knowledge to know this.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.632" offset="2734498">When a motorist calls at a service station, he expects to find there a new battery if he needs it, a new tire if he needs it, change if it's a rainy day, a new headlight if his light -- headlight is burned out at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.593" offset="2794371">It is essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.340" offset="2797296">It is what the motoring public expects.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.065" offset="2816209">The motorists expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.771" offset="2823001">They won't patronize the stations if they don't have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.071" offset="2836271">This means that the dealers can't make money unless they carry TBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.962" offset="2859781">And it is to Atlantic's interest that every Atlantic dealer, not just a great big station, every Atlantic dealer shall have TBA at the station in good supply or else a ready source of supply so that he can meet legitimate demands of the motorist.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.036" offset="2920072">And one dealer's failure to do that hurts the other Atlantic dealers and it hurts Atlantic, because the resentment of the motorist who can't get the item that he expects to find carries through to the brand.</text>

            <text syncTime="745.061" offset="2980153">I suppose in most cases, Atlantic could take care of that by provisioning or leasing through or rather arrangement with the dealer saying that a dealer in order to continue this arrangement, you must have an adequate supply of the tires and batteries?</text>

            <text syncTime="1485.303" offset="5941185">And that therefore, it should be abolished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.114" offset="5956441">Now the reason they felt that, I believe was - was confusion and perhaps it was a natural confusion, at the same time, well perhaps you should go back one step further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.847" offset="5995311">When we were operating under purchase resale, we were operating with a small tire company, the Lee Tire &amp; Rubber Company which is a local company in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.373" offset="6033450">And when we changed, we not only changed from purchase resale to sales commission, but we also changed from the Lee Tire &amp; Rubber Company as our supplier to Goodyear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.308" offset="6081202">And the Commission apparently felt that those things were -- those decisions were in someway tied together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.348" offset="6105339">They were not, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.952" offset="6111713">The reason we changed from the small tire company was simply that it did not have the public acceptance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.784" offset="6139089">Our dealers were at a handicapped trying to sell the Lee brand of tires against the dealers of other outlets.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.594" offset="6574289">But the point that I'm getting at here is, it isn't the smallness of the oil company or the product of the tire company which distinguishes purchase resale from sales commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="2435.676" offset="9742629">The record in this case establishes that when Atlantic approached Goodyear back in 1951, because Atlantic had unhappy experiences with the - with its purchase resale prior there too, Goodyear offered Atlantic both plans.</text>

            <text syncTime="2593.078" offset="10372284">It is without precedent, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.183" offset="10384718">I don't think, Your Honors will find it in any of your prior decisions precedent an order of this type, on this kind of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.637" offset="10414498">It goes beyond anything I'm familiar with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.477" offset="10425887">In one fell of swoop a sales commission plan used by Goodyear alone so far as the problems before you, this is not an industry wide horizontal agreement case, nothing of that kind, but Goodyear alone is forbidden to make a sales commission agreement with any oil company of any size, anywhere in the United States even if the oil companies are small and selling in eight counties in some place and wants it, even if it has - and one of these has only eight less Lee dealers and then they have 20 contract dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.158" offset="10560575">It's the sort of the provision which I hope to be able to persuade, Your Honors, after lunch is completely without precedent and completely without reason, and not only as without reason but the Commission has failed to articulate any reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.673" offset="10618671">They have a rational reason why that drastic remedy is the appropriate and necessary remedy to deal with whatever problems they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.383" offset="10657437">In respect to Goodyear's position therefore concerning the order, the Goodyear urges that, Your Honors, vacate paragraphs one, two, and three of the final order which relate to Goodyear and also hat Your Honors, vacate paragraphs one, two, three, and four of the Atlantic paragraph because Goodyear is indirectly prevented by those paragraphs from having a sales commission plan with Atlantic since Atlantic is prevented from having it with Goodyear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.019" offset="10816052">So that we have an interest, Goodyear has an interest in one, two, three, and four of the Atlantic portion of the order and in one, two, and three of the Goodyear portion of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.457" offset="10857744">Goodyear, of course, raises no question here with respect to the paragraphs five and six of the Atlantic order which enjoined any attempted coercion or coercive type pressure by Atlantic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.798" offset="10907167">Atlantic itself does not see fit to attack those provisions of the order and we're confident, they will eliminate any coercive practices by Atlantic if any fact is occurring something about which Goodyear had no knowledge in any event.</text>

            <text syncTime="2748.127" offset="10992431">Mr. Chief Justice, I will, may it please the Court, advance four points on behalf of Goodyear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.028" offset="11020016">My first point briefly stated is that Goodyear is not a transgressor on this record and that it was so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.068" offset="11060245">My second point is that there was no inherent illegality in the sales commission plan itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.348" offset="11089293">My third point is that the government's position as to the substantive test of illegality involved in this context is I believe is close to a confession of error as it could be without expressly purporting to be so and then applying what I believe the government's substantive test of legality to be, there is no reason to sustain any provision of the order except the two provisions not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.546" offset="11222100">My fourth point has to do with remedy and basically is that in any event, a remand would be required because the Commission failed to consider alternative and less drastic remedies and failed to articulate a rational basis for the remedy which was in fact imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.112" offset="11316349">As to the first point, may I invite Your Honors' attention to the conclusions of the examiner which are at page 110 of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="3177.724" offset="12710870">This is a letter agreement which was entered into between the parties, at a time when after testing the sales commission plan in certain areas, it was decided to extend the area and this is their operative document in that connection.</text>

            <text syncTime="3243.346" offset="12973349">Of course we both understand that our organization cannot, this is an Atlantic letter, our organization cannot and will not use any methods other than salesmanship to encourage our resale outlets, to purchase your products and services, but that was the state of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="3294.701" offset="13178776">Briefly that test of illegality, I believe, is it doesn't relate to remedy at all and I don't think they seriously say that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.224" offset="13212839">What they say is, that a sales commission plan becomes illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.332" offset="13233319">When the plan is between a major rubber company and a major oil company, whatever that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.466" offset="13257770">And that the particular oil company has the power to coerce its dealers and has exercised the power, and has demonstrated a proclivity to exercise the power to coerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.015" offset="13304059">That's the net of their position as to why this plan they say substantively is a violation of Section 5, an unfair trade practice or an unfair method of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.857" offset="13351393">However, if that test be accepted and I'm willing to assume it for present purposes as a correct test of legality, the fact is that is if it were ever true of Atlantic, it's no longer true because of the injunctive provisions Atlantic can never again exercise the power to coerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.712" offset="13418789">There was no finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.177" offset="13424640">There was no basis for a conclusion in this record as to whether or not it's true of any of the other 150 added oil companies in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.980" offset="13459853">And surely it cannot be assumed in advance without a hearing that the oil companies are going to be so short sighted that they will reconcerntrate, that they are going to coerce their dealers into taking sponsored TBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.610" offset="13514397">There's no more reason to deny their good faith and advance than there is to deny a good faith of the manufacture of automobiles.</text>

            <text syncTime="3489.306" offset="13957224">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.701" offset="13970704">I like to state at the outset the basic theory on which the Commission concluded in this case that Atlantic's sales commission plans constituted and unfair method competition in violation of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.776" offset="14031099">I don't think that's been brought out very clearly by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.180" offset="14044682">They rest it basically on what I would call free ultimate findings which the Commissions make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.772" offset="14071014">The first one was that the Atlantic Refining Oil Company has sufficient economic power over its retail and wholesale distributors to coerce them to purchase a substantial amount of the so-called sponsored TBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.145" offset="14132558">That's the TBA produced by Goodyear and Firestone with whom they had these plans to cause them to purchase a substantial amount of sponsored TBA even without the use of the coercive tactics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.393" offset="14185535">Now there has been a great deal to talk about coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.955" offset="14195775">The Commission said that coercion was merely symptomatic of the basic vice of these plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.434" offset="14217718">The first finding is that the economic power that Atlantic had over its dealers was sufficient to cause them to you to purchase the substantial amount of sponsored TBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.915" offset="14259618">The second basic finding was that Atlantic in this case in fact had used that power to accomplish that objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.336" offset="14293264">And the third and critical finding is that the result of the exercise of this power pursuant to the sales commission plan, resulted in a restraint upon competition at three different levels of the TBA business at the retail level that is the local gasoline distributor, at the wholesale level, and at the manufacturing level.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.052" offset="14380199">Now the thrust of my argument before the Court this afternoon will be first, I'm going to persuade the Court, I hope to persuade the Court that these three ultimate findings are as the Court of Appeals expressly found supported by substantial evidence in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.065" offset="14460238">And then I shall show that on the basis of these ultimate findings, the Commission correctly concluded that these sales commission plans do violate Section 5.</text>

            <text syncTime="3630.818" offset="14523246">The Mr. Justice Harlan, let me explain precisely what the Commission's position is on purchase resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.394" offset="14549473">We do not believe that the Commission has expressly passed upon the legality of purchase resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.784" offset="14579043">The Commission has a provision in its order which in terms does not make the order applicable to purchase resale and therefore - and the order as it now stands they are permitted to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.568" offset="14626168">That provision was put into the order because in the appeal from the examiner's decision, Commission staff counsel asked for a broad order that would prohibit purchase resale as well as the sales commission plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.862" offset="14683429">The Commission declined to do that and we think properly because the validity of the purchase resale plan has never been litigated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.155" offset="14712581">It was not charged in the complaint and the Commission has not -- has never passed upon the validity of that plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.311" offset="14737241">So that as we -- as we view the case, what we now have is an order prohibiting the sales commission plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.349" offset="14765349">The order does not in terms condemn purchase resale because that was not at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.166" offset="14780604">This is a matter that is open before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.077" offset="14792307">Now we don't know what type of plan these people might choose to adopt if this Court sustains this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.370" offset="14821460">They may go back to purchase-resale as they had it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.543" offset="14834103">They made up some modified plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.461" offset="14841835">They may, as I shall come to in a minute, eliminate many of the features under the purchase-resale plan which the Commission found bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.285" offset="14877048">They may decide on something else entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.742" offset="14890945">The record contains abundant evidence in this case that there are many wholesale distributors of TBA throughout entire -- Atlantic's entire area who were literally pounding on the door of these gasoline stations and I will show later that one of the complaints was that they couldn't get into the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.458" offset="14957819">That this market was all tied up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.079" offset="14964297">So we just don't' know what's going to happen and let me add one other factor which I think is very important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.630" offset="14986449">If this Court affirms and Atlantic then wishes to try to go back to a purchase-resale program, the way that's open under the Commission's rules of practice for Atlantic to seek an advisory opinion from the Commission as to the validity under the statute of their any new proposal they make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.139" offset="15060532">This Commission just about two years ago adopted a rule of practice in which it said that when someone proposes a new method, a new change in their business, now they were not given advisory opinion as to the validity of an existing method of business, but if someone proposes a new method of doing business, they can submit a detailed request to the Commission for an advisory opinion on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="4031.754" offset="16126955">I would concede that if we had a sales commission pla --- if we had purchase-resale plan that was identical in every way, there's only one respect as to which that might have a different effect and that is the impact on the competing manufacturers of TBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.152" offset="16192575">But in terms of the pressure, in terms of the pressure, it would obviously the pressure would be the same whether Atlantic is selling its own stuff or whether it's pushing Goodyear and Firestone stuff.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.789" offset="16243148">We just don't know how they're going to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.584" offset="16250253">It maybe that a purchase-resale plan, that they would come up with would have a very lesser in our competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.717" offset="16278779">But if I may, I'd like to get into show actually what they did in this case and then to suggest why there may well be situations where eliminating some of the things they did in this case would not have the same adverse effect on competition as the time the Commission condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.175" offset="16352653">Now the Court of Appeals in this case, we think correctly stated that the heart of the case is Atlantic's economic power over its dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.368" offset="16389433">And they went on and said the keystone of the relationship between Atlantic and its dealers are these short-term leases on which to which - under which they lease the stations and the short-term requirements contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.323" offset="16437290">This - this gasoline dealers are small business in the real sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.938" offset="16455680">Many of them start business with only a thousand dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.923" offset="16467592">We see in this record a man invested $3000 or $4000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.528" offset="16482011">They sometimes don't even have enough money to pay for filling up the gasoline tanks when they start business let alone to buy the tires, the batteries, and all the equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.653" offset="16518583">So Atlantic loans the money frequently with which to open up their station.</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.872" offset="16543451">The relationship between Atlantic and its individual dealers is obviously not one of equal bargaining power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.593" offset="16578351">You have a tremendous company on the one hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.536" offset="16586083">You have a very small businessman who would presumably investing his small life savings to become an independent businessman and go into business for himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.252" offset="16624953">The majority of these leases the Commission found run for only one year and while they're automatically renewable, it's in the sole discretion of Atlantic whether to continue them in or whether to cancel it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.929" offset="16675631">Now the lease which the dealers give it as a form or credit from which he is told to sign at the bottom, and sign somewhere else, again, a clear indication of the gross disparity in bargaining power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.029" offset="16720039">And only last term in the Union Oil case, this Court recognized the tremendous power that an oil company has in getting its dealers to follow its wishes when the dealers are so dependent upon it because of the short-term leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4200.804" offset="16803213">And the Court of Appeals we think recognized the realities of the situation when it said that in view of this relationship, recommendation by Atlantic is tantamount to command.</text>

            <text syncTime="4588.197" offset="18352692">Well I think, Mr. Justice that it's the basic vice of the plan itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.960" offset="18367739">The plan, under the plan Atlantic agrees for this fee to sponsor TBA and it spells out in considerable detail just what they are supposed to do by way of sponsoring.</text>
            <text syncTime="4605.348" offset="18421342">It says well a man will call the other and let me just explain what they did under this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.253" offset="18444957">How this this thing works?</text>
            <text syncTime="4613.244" offset="18452898">We start with the fact that as soon as the plan was adopted, Atlantic immediately announced to its dealers that the plan was going forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.503" offset="18497933">They had Atlantic and Goodyear representatives jointly called on the Atlantic dealers to urge them to buy the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.524" offset="18530011">They went around and took down the Lee and the Exide signs and put up Goodyear signs, put up Firestone signs, even though the dealers didn't ask for them and in some instances the dealers objected to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4647.501" offset="18589989">The record shows, if - let me come back to that, let me go on with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4653.603" offset="18614335">Then after the plan was in effect, they conducted a tremendous pressure campaign on these dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.611" offset="18638367">It starts with a new dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4660.852" offset="18643383">When a man - when a man has been selected as a possible new dealer, he's subjected to three interviews before they select by the salesman, by the supervisor, and by the district manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.839" offset="18679327">In each instance, they emphasize to him that Atlantic has a TBA program and that Atlantic wants him to carry it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.903" offset="18707540">Then he goes to the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.050" offset="18712137">They run a school.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.933" offset="18715690">They give him five weeks instruction course on how to run the service station.</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.687" offset="18730736">At the school, again, there are demonstrations of TBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.609" offset="18746410">It's always the sponsored TBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.778" offset="18759053">They give the company, the tire company's advance notice when a new dealer is about to open his service station, they give him advance notice so that these companies can come in and get the initial order which is a large order to stock at the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.496" offset="18817881">They take them around and introduce them to the dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.361" offset="18829375">The dealer has bought in, it is just assumed as one of the witnesses testified at the school that when you open your station, you're going to buy this from the stocking point, from the Goodyear or Firestone supply point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.299" offset="18881097">And then the salesman from Atlantic continues to come around with the salesman from the tire company, the salesman from Atlantic take the orders and the record shows that when the Atlantic salesman sees other products in there, they constantly criticize them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.380" offset="18945463">They're saying, What are you doing with this thing here and the whole thing just feels a tremendous pressure on the dealer that he in effect is no longer has the basic freedom of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4747.904" offset="18991543">He feels under this pressure considering that Atlantic is behind him with this tremendous economic power that keep punching home to him, take this, take this, take this and he really feels that he doesn't have freedom of choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="4792.945" offset="19171683">The first instance it's set fort in page 237 of the record, a wholesaler in Pennsylvania came to a dealer and wanted to sell him a Polish called Wiz which was not one of the sponsored products and the dealer said to him when he asked him about this coat, Sorry Glen, but I have to reserve this for Ed Paris.</text>
            <text syncTime="4816.904" offset="19267605">Ed Paris parenthetically was the supply point to which the Goodyear particular dealer - I'm sorry, the Atlantic dealer was assigned, the Goodyear supply point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.144" offset="19304490">And the importance of that is that under the plan, under the plan, Atlantic only receives the commission on Goodyear products sold through a Goodyear supply point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.258" offset="19352973">That is if the dealer buys Goodyear tires but not from the supplied point to which he is assigned, Atlantic doesn't get a commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="5007.910" offset="20031634">Well let me explain -- come to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.569" offset="20050233">The record at the time it was before the Commission showed that Goodyear had contract with either [Inaudible] other oil companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5021.629" offset="20086491">The Commission found that the sales commission plan is a violation of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="5028.385" offset="20113450">The Commission had before it in this record evidence dealing with coercive or pressured tactics by three of the eight or ninth companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.161" offset="20164545">The Commission also found that the sales commission plan, the contracts, that Goodyear had with these other companies where in order to all respect identical with this - most of them with the same kind of letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5053.900" offset="20215536">They obligate the oil companies to do the same kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.652" offset="20234553">And that the Commission I think reasonably concluded on the basis of the evidence of coercion but it adds the three of the none -- that it was not unreasonable to assume that these other plans were likely to have the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5071.343" offset="20285336">The evidence by the way - the evidence is quite the same kind of evidence that we have dealing with Atlantic's dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.971" offset="20359837">I would like us to refer to a very dramatic example which is given in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5095.183" offset="20380630">Now this is - this is not printed in the Atlantic record, this is in the Goodyear record but it's also referred to in the Commission's opinion involving a dealer named McMaster and I want to go beyond the Commission's opinion because it's amplified a little more, it's at pages 11-12 to 11-13 of the Goodyear record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5118.659" offset="20474567">McMaster was a dealer of Sinclair, a Lesse dealer, who had a Sinclair, of course, had an agreement with Goodyear and one day, Mr. McMaster who had been purchasing a rival brand of batteries called Bauers was summoned down to the Goodyear office.</text>
            <text syncTime="5138.550" offset="20554188">And as the conversation went, they called him into the office and there were three men sitting there and one said, Mr. McCall, he said, We will make this brief Mac.</text>
            <text syncTime="5146.598" offset="20586371">You are not buying batteries from us and McMaster said, No, he was not buying batteries that he couldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.016" offset="20611971">He had, during the war and just after the war, batteries were in short supply, had been able to get them from Bauers and that, that they have promised the Bauers company in return have given them their business, and went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.488" offset="20665887">And the require was, and the almost exact words were We don't give a god damn who you think you are.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.759" offset="20694936">You are going to buy our batteries or else.</text>
            <text syncTime="5176.780" offset="20707056">And by our batteries, we're referring to Goodyear and then the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5181.101" offset="20724402">Thereafter, did you continue to buy Bauers batteries?</text>
            <text syncTime="5190.173" offset="20760660">Answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.178" offset="20760555">No, not for very long because I knew what the or else meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.402" offset="20760451">Question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.769" offset="20760346">What did it mean to you?</text>
            <text syncTime="5190.868" offset="20763376">The man cancellation of my lease the next time it came up for a new one?</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.185" offset="20780722">So that what we have in this record as far as Goodyear is concerned is the instances of three companies with whom they were doing - who were doing the same kind of pressures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5205.075" offset="20820219">And we also have indications in the record at least two of the companies had short-term leases and we have evidence in the record showing that most of the oil companies do employ a short term lease and this is the basis on which we think that Commission was justified in entering the Court order against Goodyear.</text>

            <text syncTime="5318.541" offset="21274122">In 1948 and 1949, when Atlantic was still using the purchase-resale plan, made a survey of seven -- of service station dealers of seven different companies to find out what their tie-up preferences were.</text>
            <text syncTime="5335.057" offset="21340160">Now under this survey, 67% of the Atlantic dealers announced that they preferred the Lee tires and 79% preferred Exide batteries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.661" offset="21394599">These were the two products which they were then handling under the purchase-resale plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5354.639" offset="21418527">Only 11% preferred Goodyear and only 4% preferred Firestone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5360.559" offset="21442142">That was in 1947 and 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.167" offset="21452591">In 1951, when the plan went into effect, by the end of the year, Lee and Exide, the two companies which previously had been connected with the purchase-resale plan had lost 75% of their business which they previously had with the Atlantic dealers as a result of this.</text>

            <text syncTime="6097.894" offset="24391576">This is - this is what you have in the business world - in the world generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="6102.007" offset="24407980">And - and the vice in this thing, the vice in this thing as we see it is that it brings together the oil company and the tire company.</text>
            <text syncTime="6115.376" offset="24461479">The oil company has this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6118.011" offset="24472033">The tire company as the Court of Appeals said in effect buys the captive market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6122.585" offset="24490318">The oil company can put pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="6125.174" offset="24500663">They're able to sell a tremendous amount of stuff, $50 million worth over six year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="6132.102" offset="24528353">They paid them a very substantial - an output.</text>
            <text syncTime="6134.844" offset="24539324">And I just like to refer to one thing that Mr. Sonnett said about Goodyear not being a transgressor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6146.071" offset="24584255">Because Goodyear, in this case, didn't just signed the contract and then shipped tires, it did more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6153.499" offset="24613930">The Goodyear salesman went around with the Atlantic salesman.</text>
            <text syncTime="6157.457" offset="24629812">The Goodyear representatives participated in the demonstrations that were done.</text>
            <text syncTime="6165.051" offset="24660114">The Goodyear people went around and removed the signs of the competing products.</text>
            <text syncTime="6170.887" offset="24683520">Goodyear reported to Atlantic the names of oil dealers at the early stage where it couldn't put the signs in.</text>
            <text syncTime="6177.690" offset="24710687">And the findings to which Mr. Sonnett referred, the Commission's finding that every one of the examiner's findings supported by substantial evidence, that finding was made not in a general statement as to what it was doing with the examiner's report.</text>
            <text syncTime="6197.098" offset="24788323">That statement was made in response to the specific argument that the examiner in this case had been prejudiced because he relied on evidence he had heard in the Companion case and he wasn't rejecting that that the Commission made the statement of the examiner's finding is supported by evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6215.421" offset="24861675">So what all that means is that the examiner's findings in this case to the extent they were proved were supported by evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6223.239" offset="24892918">And at page 131 of the Atlantic record in the Commission's final order in this case the third paragraph says, he has ordered that the findings and conclusion of the initial be in here by our modified and supplemented to conform to the findings and conclusions that you have set forth in this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6240.234" offset="24960836">So that the - to the Commission only adopted the examiner's findings to the extent that those findings conformed to the Commission's decision to this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="6586.124" offset="26344490">There's an amicus brief in this case filed by the Shell Oil Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="6590.636" offset="26362462">The Commission -- this is one of the three companion cases brought against this TBA system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6596.357" offset="26385345">If this case -- there's another one brought against the Texaco Company and the Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Company which was set aside by the DC Circuit depending on certiorari, there's a third case now pending on the Fifth Circuit which has not yet been decided involving Firestone on the one hand and Shell on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="6612.809" offset="26451174">And Shell also has a contract with Goodyear.</text>
            <text syncTime="6615.962" offset="26463817">Shell says, well this is most unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="6619.122" offset="26476460">The Commission has an order against Goodyear protecting our -- which prohibits Goodyear from carrying out its agreement with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="6628.236" offset="26512927">Perhaps in the Fifth Circuit, we may win that case and the Fifth Circuit may hold that our agreement with Goodyear is alright because presumably on its theory that Shell wouldn't have this economic power.</text>
            <text syncTime="6639.235" offset="26556918">Well if the Fifth Circuit holds that, then it seems to me the way is open to Goodyear to come back to the Commission and say, now here's a particular case where the finding of the Court of Appeals is that the basis of your decision does not exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6653.295" offset="26613133">Therefore, we're entitled to a modification as far as this particular contract is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="6659.550" offset="26638106">But this seems to me and gives them an out in effect, if as to particular case, they can prove that the Commission was in error in pretending in entering in the Court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="6673.098" offset="26692336">But it seems to me that this is not a basis -- this possibility is not a basis for saying that the most the Commission could do in this case was to cancel the agreement between Goodyear and Atlantic.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="6692.072" offset="26768196">Well the Broch order was a little different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6694.025" offset="26776033">The Broch order was there had been true of a discrimination with one customer and the Commission added an order prohibiting a similar brokerage rebate with any other buyer or seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="6705.556" offset="26822217">The Seventh Circuit struck out the provision extending it to any other buyer or seller and this Court reinstated it so the Commission was entitled to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6715.192" offset="26860669">That's perhaps - I've read this just with the Broch case, perhaps it's a closer analogy to the question of whether it could prohibit the order with Atlantic because it seems to me that it is a perfect analogy for the Atlantic contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="6731.334" offset="26925244">The Commission found that Atlantic's agreement with Goodyear was illegal and the Atlantic's agreement with Firestone was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6739.387" offset="26957531">It seems to me both that the Broch case is perfectly thought in saying in those circumstances the Commission could also prohibit Atlantic from entering into similar contracts with other tire companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6752.136" offset="27008522">But I think -- I figure it gives some help to us but basically it's more on the general theory that if they find that a person has violated the law and there seems to be a reasonable basis to believe, that other practices are comparable that that too can be prohibited as an exercise of the Commission's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6788.089" offset="27152300">Now I just like very briefly to refer which I haven't come to yet but the basic theory, legal theory on which the Commission said this is an unfair method of competition, it's by really by analogy to the tying cases, the Commission found that the effect of this agreement was to limit the opportunities for the retail gasoline dealers to purchase where they felt that they wanted to purchase, it limited the opportunities of the wholesalers to sell and it limited the opportunities of competing manufacturers to sell in this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6824.800" offset="27299109">And the end result, the end result of this it seems to me in terms of the effects on competition is basically the same adverse consequences to which this Court has alluded to in the tying cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6839.763" offset="27358981">To paraphrase the language of the tying cases, that the effect of this agreement is that at the retail level, the gasoline dealer is -- makes his purchases not on the basis of his independent judgment that this is what he wishes to buy, but because Atlantic with its power in the gasoline business is putting the pressure on him to buy another kind of product.</text>
            <text syncTime="6867.978" offset="27471830">Now I think there's a very dramatic illustration of this kind of pressure in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6873.195" offset="27492728">The two witnesses who testified that even though they could have bought the identical product, the Goodyear tire from another Goodyear dealer at less money than they had to pay at the Goodyear supply point, they nevertheless felt obligated to buy from a Goodyear supply point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6892.391" offset="27569528">But there's - there could be no question in those cases that it'd be in a different product that was cheaper was inferior, it was the identical product and here you have this supposedly independent businessman who pays more for the identical product than he could have gotten it elsewhere because of this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="6910.340" offset="27641313">Those are the two witnesses that I would like to cite them in our brief there at pages 634 and 644 and 652 of the Atlantic record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6920.786" offset="27683109">Now in the other -- the other point of view from the point of view of the wholesalers of TBA, they too are foreclosed from this substantial market covered by the sales commission plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="6935.178" offset="27740682">There is testimony of wholesale after wholesaler who have testified that he just couldn't make any in rows in this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6942.229" offset="27768895">And indeed, the most remarkable thing about this is, these wholesalers by and large indicated, they could sell to the Atlantic service stations products not covered by the sales commission plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="6956.683" offset="27826678">There were certain types of automatic -- automotive parts particularly things they use in repair works so-called [Inaudible] were not covered by the sales commission plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="6966.241" offset="27864921">They were able to sell those, but they testified that when they try to sell the Atlantic dealers the products that were covered by the sales commission plan, that's when they ran up against the stone war.</text>
            <text syncTime="6979.835" offset="27919256">They could sell them on a filling basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="6982.890" offset="27931481">If occasionally a particular dealer needed a battery and hurry for customer and his supply point couldn't supply, that's what they could sell but they couldn't come in and sell the man a stock of these products.</text>
            <text syncTime="6995.290" offset="27981113">Now so that the end result of this is that the plan operates has the same effect on competition as a time plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="7007.647" offset="28030537">Now when Congress passed the Federal Trade Commission Act in 1914 and it intentionally left it to the Commission to fill down the basis of accumulating -- accumulating experience in expertise just what were the unfair methods of competition is above.</text>

            <text syncTime="7136.429" offset="28545672">I don't know what plans and another thing, I suppose the more you reduce the things that the oil companies going to do under the program, the less attractive the program is going to be in the tire company.</text>
            <text syncTime="7149.181" offset="28596663">At some point it seems to me the tire company will say, there's no point in paying these Commissions, we're not getting anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="7155.055" offset="28620173">Now whether in fact these various changes would have the result of making the plan so unattractive, I don't know, but again I think it would turn largely on precisely to what extent they've eliminated these and there's something I should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="7173.972" offset="28695824">During the operation of this plan, and if I may just continue, during the operation of this plan Atlantic put out various written instructions to its dealers, to its salesmen, in which they keep repeatedly saying, no coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="7189.987" offset="28759876">The dealer is free to select what he wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="7193.542" offset="28774087">But despite what they said, despite what they said, it's quite apparent that it's from the dealer's point of view, the dealer believed that he was required to buy this and I point this out to Mr. Justice Brennan in answer to your question because again, if there would be modifications of the sales plan, it might well depend on precisely how the modification was made.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Simon</label>
            <text syncTime="7431.114" offset="29724421">Briefly in reply, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7438.141" offset="29752529">There is, Mr. Justice Goldberg, an expression in this industry which I'm sure is not confined the brush off technique in dealing with the salesman and what you were describing earlier is very prevalent in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="7453.908" offset="29815536">Statements to which counsel referred where it would be a supply that came into a refilling station and just brushed off by the dealer were statements incidentally that got into this record being statements by a would be a supplier of what dealer told them and they were admitted not for the truth of the statements but as showing the dealer's state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="7477.962" offset="29911771">They were not admitted for the truth of the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="7481.018" offset="29923997">In respect to the question as to whether or not Goodyear is a transgressor, I do not understand counsel to dispute what I've said to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7488.786" offset="29955135">The uncontradicted finding in this case is that Goodyear is not a transgressor and has not participated in a single coercive act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7499.252" offset="29996931">The reference by counsel, the one with McMasters and some very unpleasant meeting at somebody's office as the record will show was not a Goodyear office.</text>
            <text syncTime="7511.506" offset="30045936">We were not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="7514.866" offset="30059416">In respect to this attempted distinction between overt and covert coercion, I don't understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7521.370" offset="30085433">And I think there's only one kind of coercion and if it's overt, it relates to one way of doing it and if it's covert, it relates to another way of doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7529.951" offset="30119706">It's just the means of whether they're explicit or implicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7535.691" offset="30142694">That's overt and covert coercion and this is a coercion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7539.141" offset="30156487">I think it emerges from counsel's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="7542.460" offset="30169757">Now it's equally clear from counsel's brief that that's what the government's position before this Court really is.</text>
            <text syncTime="7549.671" offset="30198596">Your Honors, will look at page 70 of the government's brief, you'll find at the bottom of page 70 a statement beginning the Commission properly viewed everything that Atlantic did under the sales commission plan as a single interrelated program, say these were the steps by which Atlantic satisfied its contractual obligation to sponsor and promote Goodyear products and for all which Goodyear undertook to pay it a substantial commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7578.347" offset="30313326">These steps included the various activities described at length in the statements such as promotion of sponsored TBA, et cetera, et cetera, and then they go on and at page 71 has a semicolon and then they say, and finally threatening dealers who refuse to purchase Goodyear TBA with cancellation on non-renewal of their leases on contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="7602.901" offset="30411546">In sum it says the government, Atlantic marshaled the full measure of its economic power of rich dealers to carry out a pressure campaign designed to get them to handle Goodyear and Firestone products and because of the extent of that power that campaign was highly successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="7621.410" offset="30485629">I think if, Your Honors, we'll also look at page 73 of the government's brief, you find the statement since the basic vice of the sales commission plan is Atlantic's exercise of its economic power of its dealers to require them to purchase sponsored TBA.</text>
            <text syncTime="7643.993" offset="30575909">That theme is throughout the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="7646.718" offset="30586776">I think it's implicit in the argument which counsel was made and with that, Mr. Justice White, that I had in mind what I said that in substance I believe government before this Court confesses error in respect to the position of its Commission and the Court of Appeals relied upon.</text>
