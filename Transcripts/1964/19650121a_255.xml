            <text syncTime="20.991" offset="83905">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.046" offset="100101">This case involves a temporary layoff or lockout by the American Ship Building Company which occurred on August 11, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.390" offset="149525">I would like to call the attention to a few of the salient facts with the Court's permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.429" offset="181708">The case was originally brought charging violations of Section 8 (a) (1), 8 (a) (3) and 8 (a) (5) of the Taft-Hartley Act and was brought against all of the shipyards which this company operates in Buffalo, New York, Toledo and Lorain, Ohio and Chicago, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.918" offset="259657">However, the Board dismissed the charge of failure to bargain on the 8 (a) (5) and held only with respect to the Chicago shipyard that there had been violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.153" offset="312529">I'd like to call also to the attention --</text>

            <text syncTime="80.016" offset="320052">This is a single employer.</text>

            <label>Mr. William S. Tyson</label>
            <text syncTime="81.758" offset="326949">Right, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.534" offset="330083">This is a single employer layoff or lockout as compared with the one which you gentlemen heard yesterday involving the multiemployer lockout.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.552" offset="378149">I'd like to call to the attention of the Court the fact that this was a three to two decision by the National Labor Relations Board and the Chairman of the Board, Chairman McCulloch wrote the minority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.097" offset="440320">He was joined by a member Rogers in that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.091" offset="448261">It was three to two indicating which is very close and then the case was appealed to the -- or went to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia for enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.740" offset="486922">The Court of Appeals held that the order should be enforced and on petition which we filed here, this Court has accepted the petition of the American Ship Building Company to hear the case on a limited bases on the question of whether or not the single employer lockout is the corollary of a strike under the Taft-Hart -- under Section 8 (b) (4) of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="148.058" offset="592144">No sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.909" offset="603533">In -- in December 1960, the American Ship Building Company knowing the depressed condition under which the industry on the Great Lakes had operated and knowing that they were a seasonal operation because the Great Lakes are frozen over from November through to April decided that they would like to have the new contract which expired on July 31, the old contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.561" offset="710217">They just like to have that renewed with the least disturbance that would be possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.900" offset="735504">So they had a meeting in December and suggested this to the unit organization which was they -- there are eight craft unions here and the Boilermakers Local No. 374 in Chicago is the one that referred the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.663" offset="802586">Subsequently, the parties in May 1961 exchanged proposal for the new contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.938" offset="831739">And on June 6, 1961, the first meeting of the parties was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.351" offset="869355">At that meeting --</text>

            <label>Mr. William S. Tyson</label>
            <text syncTime="222.029" offset="888059">July 31, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.219" offset="900807">At that meeting, the negotiator for the American Ship Building Company called attention to the depressed condition of the industry in the Great Lakes and mentioned the fact that the company was paying as much as 42 cents an hour more than its competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.478" offset="969874">In addition, the union negotiator stated that he didn't want a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.414" offset="993593">Well both then said they didn't want a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.059" offset="1008222">Subsequent negotiations took place beginning -- well all through June and then on July 6 the company suggested that the Federal Mediations Service to be called into the dispute and a conciliator was brought into the dispute of that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.192" offset="1072692">On July 31, agreement still had not been reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.009" offset="1087948">And the company had been asked if they would agree to a six months extension of the contract or to an indefinite extension of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.545" offset="1122116">The company would not agree to that because they thought with the validity I think that that would enable stalling on the part of the negotiating unions to bring about a strike during their busy season when they would be most vulnerable to a strike effort by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.170" offset="1204663">But they did agree to carry on while the union took a vote on their last proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.512" offset="1234024">They also suggested, and this is not mentioned in the facts of the respondent's brief, but they also offered the union a one year extension of the existing contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.346" offset="1289300">That I believe is at page 177 or 178 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.205" offset="1312810">In any event, the conciliator was sufficiently worried about precipitous strike action to ask that a communication be transmitted to a high official of the union in Washington to ask that no precipitous strike action be taken by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.440" offset="1377698">As a result, and I believe that is at page 267 of the record, as a result on August the 2nd, this union official sent a telegram in which he assured that there would be no precipitous strike action until he had it arrived in Cleveland where the negotiation was taking place on August 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.484" offset="1473933">He did arrive on August 2nd, further meetings were held on August 8th and 9th and on August the 10th, no agreement having been reached, the union had refused to take back to its members for a vote, the last proposal made by the American Ship Building Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.495" offset="1553972">In view of all of those facts and an impasse having been reached in the bargaining, the company officials met on August 10 and decided that the only strategy that was available to them would be a layoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.845" offset="1611337">So notices were passed out and on the morning of August the 11th, this layoff took place in the Chicago shipyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.726" offset="1646864">Now, it is important to note and I typically call this to the Court's attention that the record of bargaining in this situation was quite unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.703" offset="1706736">This company during the previous ten years, beginning in 1962, had been faced with a strike and there had been a strike on each occasion that the contract expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.578" offset="1766296">In 1952, in 1953, in 1955, in 1956, in 1958, five strikes with five contracts.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="453.252" stopTime="461.349">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="453.252" offset="1813002">Mr. Tyson, can you tell us what happened in the last contract expired on August 15, 1963?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_s_tyson" startTime="461.349" stopTime="814.362">
            <label>Mr. William S. Tyson</label>
            <text syncTime="461.349" offset="1845394">I was going to get to that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.949" offset="1851768">I think that is quite significant, it's not in the record but I'd like to mention if I could.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.355" offset="1869322">And then, in addition, if I may, there were two walkout strikes in February 1961 in Buffalo and Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.016" offset="1904013">And in 1955 if the Court pleases a large -- a very large vessel was held in the shipyard during the strike because of a slow down which did not allow these repairs to be completed prior to this -- to the layoff -- to the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.081" offset="1980291">Now, they were the conditions under which this company was offering.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.266" offset="2000980">They were the conditions it was faced with when this impasse was reached and I might point out that the trial examiner found that this lockout was justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.953" offset="2055732">He found that there was legitimate fear of a strike and the Board refused by three to two decisions to agree with them on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.314" offset="2105156">Now, the Taft-Hartley Act of course was enacted to equalize the bargaining relationship between unions and employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.418" offset="2165656">Prior to the Wagner Act, the union side had been without proper protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.509" offset="2193972">So the Wagner Act came along in 1935 and did give in Section 7 and other sections did give protections to the unions in their striking and concerted activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.006" offset="2247993">Then in 1947 in view of the public mood, changes were made to more nearly equalize the bargaining relationship between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.300" offset="2301179">And I might mention that in the Wagner Act, there was no prohibition of a lockout, that's pretty clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.446" offset="2341721">When the Taft-Hartley Act came along, there is still no prohibition of the lockout except within the 60-day period as mentioned in Section 8 (b) (4), the notice period which says during that period there should be no strike or lockout.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.419" offset="2409639">But in Taft-Hartley, the strike and the lockout are coupled in four sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.510" offset="2437956">And this Court in what I termed the Truck Drivers case which was really a decision of this Court in the Buffalo Linen case, this Court in that case with Mr. Justice Brennan speaking said that the mention of the strike and lockout in the same context there in those four sections constituted a recognition.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.619" offset="2542446">In the Taft-Hartley Act that lockouts were not in effect completely barred and they were not illegal per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.136" offset="2580480">That we certainly agree with and we rely to a considerable degree on this Truck Drivers Local case.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.997" offset="2615902">In that case which I believe, I can't remember but I believe it was six or seven or eight to -- nothing I'm not sure of that number.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.512" offset="2654041">But I know it was pretty nearly unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.632" offset="2666475">And in that case, the Court also said that the protections provided by Section 7 and 13 of the Act for union activities they are not so absolute as to deny self help to employers when the legitimate interest of employers and employees collide, that gentlemen is the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.119" offset="2792385">They have collided.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.626" offset="2798446">And we contend that the legitimate interest of the American Ship Building Company need to be protected by this -- needed to be protected by this layoff which took place on August 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.275" offset="2853094">And I might say in answer to the earlier question of Justice Goldberg that according to information that I have, there has been the best relationship between the unions and the company subsequent to this layoff which ended on October 27, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.910" offset="2935536">As a matter of fact I have been told that the relationship is now so good that instead of having five strikes in ten years that there's just peace, peace between the two different -- different bargaining parties and that I think is very wonderful.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.241" offset="3012963">But getting back to this situation here, the Truck Drivers Local case not only took the position that lockouts were not barred but they took a further position that the position of the Board legitimatizing an economic lockout was not a full extent of the power of the Act to permit lockout.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.680" offset="3174713">In other words, they indicated or at least we think the Court indicated that there were other lockouts that were permissible other than the economic lockout and of course in that case, the multiemployer lockout was permitted to protect the employer against whipsaw union tactics.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.471" offset="3253812">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="1371.123" offset="5484460">For instance, the bargaining lockout, of course, is to advance the bargain for the employer to try to get him as good an employment contract as his passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.019" offset="5535974">Well, the Court in the Truck Drivers Local case at page 96 in speaking of the multiemployer lockout, if I may read the sentence, it says conflict may arise for example to clean the right strike and the interest of the small employers in preserving multiemployer bargaining as a means of bargaining on an equal basis with a large union and of -- and avoiding the competitive disadvantage resulting from non-uniform contractual term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.923" offset="5691664">Now, our point in reading that is just the Court in approving this multiemployer lockout recognized that the protection of this multiemployer bargaining unit which they considered so important by the small employer that that also gave the employer a competitive advantage over his competitors and in that sense, this falls within the economic realm, according to our view, and therefore, this Court we hope will not follow the Board's action in trying to make all of these lockouts different to fit their theory because some of these lockouts that they call economic really advance the bargaining interest of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.762" offset="5910988">Take the Alaska Businessmen Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.751" offset="5934916">In that case it brings out a very vividly the difficulty of the position urged by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.968" offset="5959784">In that case, the association had a selective strike, the multiemployer bargaining organization that are like at a selective strike and there was a lockout at certain unstruck employer but the question there and they held that the lockout is illegal, the question there was whether or not they had advanced their bargain as well as having preserved the bargaining unit and they held that illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.023" offset="6080052">And that shows you the difficulties of trying to separate these inseparable questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.588" offset="6102309">And for that reason, if the Court pleases, we argue very strongly that this nomenclature, this terminology that the Board is using is unauthorized, unwarranted and defeats the legitimate interest of an employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1556.140" offset="6224457">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.769" offset="6243056">At the outset, I should like to emphasize that as we view it, the second position that Mr. Tyson has urged is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.999" offset="6323931">On the findings of a majority of the Board which were sustained by the Court of Appeals, the company here at the time that it locked out or laid off its employees did not have any reasonable basis to anticipate a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.981" offset="6411912">So this is not a case that sits within the so called economic necessity of Betts Cadillac line of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.870" offset="6451409">The dissent of Chairman McCulloch and the Board went simply to that factual issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.290" offset="6497071">He did not just reach the issue and as a matter of fact indicated that he was not reaching or deciding in a way different from the way the majority of the Board has decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.592" offset="6570318">The legal issue which is before the Court here namely whether or not a single employer has the right to use the lockout as an offensive weapon, in other words, to advance his bargaining position even though he is not faced with any or has no reasonable basis for anticipating that a strike will be called or that he is facing any unusual operating problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1734.671" offset="6938645">I might add here that the union here offered not indefinitely to extend the current contract which had a no-strike clause but they extended until a new agreement had been reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.822" offset="7003220">So there wasn't anything indefinite about their offer here to forego a strike and as a matter of fact, they continued working at the Lorain yard which had worked in it well notwithstanding the fact that there had been a layoff at the -- of the South Chicago yard which is the only yard that's involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.138" offset="7100500">Now, earning to the legal issue which we believe is here, we don't -- I submit think that it's very helpful to try to answer it in terms of whether the lockout is the corollary of the -- of the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.955" offset="7223798">That really begs the question what we're dealing with here are the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act and what we find there is that Section 7 and 13 of the Act specifically protect the right of employees to engage in concerted activities, collective bargaining and the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.028" offset="7364023">Indeed, Section 13 says that the right to strike shall not be interfered with except insofar as the Act specifically provides otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.372" offset="7417417">As this Court recognized in the Buffalo Linen case, there is no specific protection for employer weapons where the lockout or any other economic weapon.</text>

            <text syncTime="1892.244" offset="7568927">And therefore that was a very good reason to expressly and specifically, explicitly protect the right to strike in the National Labor legislation that there was no reason at all to affirm a right that already existed that is the employer's right to -- employer's right to lockout.</text>

            <text syncTime="1953.628" offset="7814478">We submit, that Congress decidedly left that general so that the Board would on a case-by-case basis have the power to balance the legitimate interest of the employers against the impairment of employee rights involved and we submit that that is the way Congress left the question of how much of the lockout was to be left privileged to be sure the lockout as this Court recognized in Buffalo Linen is not completely prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.601" offset="7994305">But on the other hand nor is it completely permitted and the extent to which it is privileged, we submit, has been left to the Board subject to judicial review to be sure under the application of the balancing test under 8 (a) (1).</text>

            <text syncTime="2166.131" offset="8664503">And the other four factors went to the immediate impact of the super-seniority in terms of breaking up the strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="3387.064" offset="13548251">The other question -- reason for it may well be that oftentimes there's a semantic problem as to whether you got a strike or a lockout.</text>

            <text syncTime="3519.469" offset="14077806">I have just a few scattered thoughts that I would like to leave with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.300" offset="14097136">In response to what Justice Clark asked a moment ago, I believe there's a statement in the respondent's brief that the bargaining lockout has not brought to where many questions as I understand or there hadn't been very widespread.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.018" offset="14167980">I would like to say that our opponents here particularly in the amicus briefs have not come forward with any valid proposal which would solve this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.808" offset="14231197">The only thing they come forward with is let's repeal all the cases that are against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.779" offset="14251050">They want this -- they come in and asked this Court to repeal or reverse the Mackay Radio case, to reverse the Truck Drivers case, to reverse the Insurance Agents' case, and as I read the briefs, I am convinced that they would deny self-help to employers or as this Court has said, “Employers are entitled to under the Taft-Hartley Act.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3591.377" offset="14365466">Mr. Tyson, how would you answer this, which I think is underlies and splashed out of the last moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.457" offset="14389812">For your type of employer here it seems a pretty legitimate weapon to lockout, the union has done so in a series of occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.170" offset="14424607">Take the newly organized plant where the union has gone through difficult experience in organizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.812" offset="14463164">It never has a contract and under your theory of the case, first negotiation when the employer says not -- I accept the union, I accept this certification, but I'm going to close this plant down because we're not going to pay what the union wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.060" offset="14540173">Do you think the union would be that the right to strike or the survival of the union wouldn't be amount too much if that were validated?</text>

            <text syncTime="3666.087" offset="14664307">What does the employer says, I don't want to break the union, all I want is to preserve my existing wage scale which I think is the only way economically I can operate, and then therefore in order to make clear that I'm serious about this and that I better shut so the people will be able to influence their union to make this highly reasonable deal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3690.368" offset="14761378">Of course, as you know Justice Goldberg, neither side is forced under this Act to make a concession and we get to that question that you asked a moment ago about an impasse and in further response to that, in considering the questions that were asked by you and by Justice Brennan, I think my thinking on that probably was heavily weighted because of the situation here where there was an impasse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.029" offset="14884049">And I'm convinced that from a legal standpoint, an impasse may not be a prerequisite.</text>

            <text syncTime="3747.839" offset="14991256">That's possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.615" offset="14998361">I would like to say that Section 13, we think, does not confer the protection against the strike which is contented by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.006" offset="15039948">We think that that section was put into the Act originally in the Wagner Act to make it clear as you pointed out Mr. Justice Stewart that the Wagner Act did not proscribe or prohibit strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.177" offset="15096686">In other words I was trying to show that strikes were legal after Wagner Act and I don't think that has been changed and I don't think it's a protection against the lockout.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.645" offset="15134511">It has nothing to do with that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3786.474" offset="15145796">I'd also like to point out that this -- as one of the amicus brief said, if the employer did not have the right to make replacements, your argument might be a valid one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.674" offset="15198668">I'd like to say that the replacement question is one that seems to be confused here because the right to make replacements, we think, is a paper right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.377" offset="15245479">Where would you find qualified replacements for the highly technical jobs that are in most industrial plants today and furthermore who would have the nerve to disturb industrial peace in Pittsburg or Chicago or New York by using replacements, so we think that is not a valid argument and we also think that the use of the lockout is not going to disturb industrial peace because as suggested earlier, we are convinced that no employer is going to shut down his plant and take that chance without valid and justifiable reasons.</text>
