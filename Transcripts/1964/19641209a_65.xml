            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="13.955" offset="55798">-- members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.343" offset="73352">This case too as Your Honor know -- as Your Honors know, is a proceeding to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for District of Columbia by a two to one vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.667" offset="114625">Judge Bazelon dissenting upholding an order of the Subversive Activities Control Board that the petitioner, the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade registers as a Communist-front organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.738" offset="178887">The petitioner consists of surviving members of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Americans who went to Spain in 1936 to fight on the Republican's side in the civil war.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.482" offset="261851">And while the court below makes some reference to the fact that it thought from historical analysis that this was a war between Communism and Fascism, I don't think that view can fairly be attributed though the court intend to attribute it to the people who went, whether those who lived or those who didn't live.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.479" offset="353907">And I think if history is to be the test of this case, we trust it is not because we don't believe that the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade where the Spanish Civil War is on trial, but the post-1950 organization is on trial here, then I think we prefer to refer to the history which is set forth in the works of Harold Ickes, and Samuel Wells, and Jonathan Daniels and the others who evaluated the Spanish Civil War as a war of democracy against fascism.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.411" offset="473548">Thus, I say, I haven't argue this although the Board and its report devotes most of its time to the Spanish Civil War and to its significance, and the Government also played great reliance about what happened in 1936, 1938 and most important to the Government, what happened in 1939 at the time of the Soviet-Nazi Pact when the petitioner was only in the process of formation and certainly many, many years before the statutory period is relevant here, 1950 to 1955 went into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.471" offset="625789">I may say that the court below is very critical of the Board and Your Honors will read with great interest the elaborate discussion by Judge Prettyman saying that we are not concerned about the past, we are concerned about the period 1950 to 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.612" offset="702380">And Your Honorable -- Honors will say that Judge Prettyman was also very critical of the Board because his view of the meaning of the control concept which I'll discuss in a moment was radically different from of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.558" offset="762149">The fact that he came to a conclusion after much worrying about it, conclusion on the side of the Government does not diminish the fact that he disagreed radically with the Board's views.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.481" offset="813871">Now, the issue in this case as we see it is whether or not bearing in mind the very strict preponderance of evidence rule laid down by this statute in contradistinction to this substantial evident rule and other administrative agency cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.494" offset="885969">Bearing that rule in mind has the Government made out either he deny that, the control component or the aid or objective component as it is shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.296" offset="937169">And in considering whether the Government has made out those two elements I will say elements of the crime, we must bear in mind that in the construction of the statute, the constitutional consideration, the impact upon the admittedly First Amendment rights of the petitioner and its members will have to be evaluated.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.596" offset="1030374">If you have an ambiguous statute in any respect, that are on the many of decisions of the Court, most familiar to me of course Kent against Dulles decision, then the Court will construe the statute in such away as to give a minimum power to the Government rather than a maximum one.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.545" offset="1098083">Now, I'd like to say I think our case is a very clear one on the facts because as Judge Prettyman said almost startling with his words is the fact that so little of the evidence relate to 1950 or a year thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.859" offset="1187422">And it is upon so little of the evidence that the Board's order was predicated and Judge Prettyman's opinion was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.463" offset="1233816">Now, what is the evidence would respect to control and how did the Board and the Court identified it, how do they come to the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.994" offset="1267879">The Court held in contradistinction to everything said by the Board that in order for the petitioner to be controlled within the meaning of the statute, it must not merely have members of the Communist Party in its leadership, fact which as I've indicated in a moment, not have members but have functionaries or representatives of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.991" offset="1355964">This is I say was in clear contradistinction with the whole pattern of the Board's decision which makes no different distinctions between representatives, functionaries, or members.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.197" offset="1396715">So we have the basic principle laid down by the Court in elaborate language not in the passing sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.494" offset="1429943">Then we have the agreement of the Board, the Court and the record, all three, that from 1950 on when Mr. Fishman, Moe Fishman became executive secretary of the organization, he was the dominant manager of the petitioning organization, and we have -- secondly, the fact that he was assisted, assisted by a man named Milton Wolff who had been connected with the organization as supervisory capacity earlier and Milton Wolff likewise according to the Court of Appeals, as to him, there was no evidence they hint there was no evidence, no direct evidence, I'll read the words in a few minutes as to his being a functionary or even member after 1950 of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.623" offset="1686465">I may say that even as the membership, the only evidence in this elaborate record and I do think that the Court may want to look at the record because of the difference we have with Government, is that there is testimony by Mr. Boudin's, it might be familiar to this Court, that in 1940, Mr. Wollf made an admission to him that he Mr. Wolff was a member of the Communist Party and there was testimony in 1941 or its equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.066" offset="1824183">There is a testimony in 1941 by a Mr. Yuba with respect to an admission made by Mr. Fishman, 1940 and 1941, and we are today in 1964 to determine how an ct should apply to an organization based on evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.063" offset="1908193">Who is Mr. Wolff?</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="478.239" offset="1912895">Mr. Wolff was the second man in charge of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.667" offset="1922612">As a matter fact I was even wrong, at one testimony, he was a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.479" offset="1937868">There was a statement made that he made a report to a meeting of the Communist Party in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.834" offset="1967334">In other words Your Honors not even as to membership is there are anything more recent than 1940 and 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.954" offset="2011742">Now, we are accustomed and of course there's nothing as to being a functionary representative, we're accustomed when we receive briefs from the Government to accept virtually anything as a availed implementer the Solicitor General of whom we have the highest regard necessarily, and I do not attribute to him, misstatements that have made in this brief as it were in the preceding brief, with respect to the alleged membership of the Communist Party of Mr. Wolff and of Mr. Fishman, Your Honors will see at page 63 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.593" offset="2162312">Pardon me, at 64 in talking about Mr. Fishman, the Government says there is however evidence or begins by saying the evidence of Mr. Fishman is not as complete by the understatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.303" offset="2213198">There is however evidence of his party membership during the periods from 1941 -- from 1940 to 1941 and 1947, and then there are transcript references there.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.743" offset="2274952">And to possibly 1946, I'm reading the Government's brief at Page 64.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.449" offset="2297731">Now, I took precaution yesterday of going over the transcript of the record which I have here and let us see how the Government fixes membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.251" offset="2332944">We're only talking about membership now from 1940 to 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.533" offset="2354051">A witness said that he knew Mr. Fishman at some point in the past and he was then asked, “And did you know him?</text>
            <text syncTime="599.300" offset="2397100">When did you know him?”</text>
            <text syncTime="600.652" offset="2402534">And he says, “Oh, I don't remember?”</text>
            <text syncTime="602.273" offset="2409012">“Well, what decade?”</text>
            <text syncTime="603.780" offset="2415073">“I don't remember.”</text>
            <text syncTime="606.548" offset="2426149">“Well, could it have been between 1940 and 1947?”</text>
            <text syncTime="611.572" offset="2446211">As I regret to say was asked by the counsel for the petitioning organization here, whether between 1940 and 1947, and he said, “Yes, it could have been,” and so based upon this statement that he might have known Mr. Fishman from 1940 to 1947 the Government has fixed the period, the relevant date, at the latest date, 1947 instead of saying that there really is no evidence as to precise time and it could have been 40 or 41.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.942" offset="2563762">And when I -- and as I say, Your Honors will want to read the pages that the Government cites here because we are not accustomed to get that.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.538" offset="2590093">And this I regret to say is a cotangent which you get from being too close to the disease, the disease of the Board proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.470" offset="2621858">And on page 64, when I notice a reference here as a in Walsh case, Fishman is also an activist in support of a party program.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.655" offset="2662609">I looked at the reference to that, I said, “What party programs was Mr. Fishman supporting before or after?”</text>
            <text syncTime="672.545" offset="2690090">Well, there is McCarran Act analysis by the National Lawyers Guild that's one page reference, is an opposition to the arrival in the United States of falangist or fascist Mayor of Madrid.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.891" offset="2751530">This is what the Board has given to the Court as Fishman is also been active in support of party programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.533" offset="2782041">Now, I mentioned that because we are dealing here with a very delicate issue, virtually the life and death of an organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.470" offset="2813806">We're dealing with fundamental issues and this is not the way for the Government to treat fundamental issues by not giving Your Honors correct references to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.167" offset="2852571">I don't want to spend too much time on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.662" offset="2858632">I think I already had too much except to ask Your Honors to look at some of these references.</text>

            <text syncTime="719.551" offset="2878171">But what difference would that make to your legal argument?</text>

            <text syncTime="722.908" offset="2891546">My legal augment stands anyhow, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.209" offset="2900741">I don't even care of everything the Government said in their briefs were true.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.988" offset="2911922">Your Honor is quite right because basically the court below has found that these then were not functionary or a representative of the Communist Party, none of that the data relates to post-1950 and therefore there is no control in the Communist Party of this organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.852" offset="2979318">Now, there are two things, however, that the court below does say, after stating that they were not key representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.523" offset="3014008">One statement by the court below is that the representative capacity if any, remember this is a preponderance of evidence case if any of these two must be inferred from the fact that they made reports to the Politburo concerning the Brigade.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.900" offset="3095510">It happens that the court below was wrong, the only reference to report is the one I mentioned before by Mr. Boudin with respect to 1940 and with respect to Mr. Wolff, hardly, I think proof of representative capacity in 1950 of Mr. Fishman or Mr. Wolff, and then the Court makes reference to a letter, a letter that was showing by some people of the Court thought might be an Executive Board even though there was testimony of the Executive Board didn't operate from 1949 on and Mr. Fishman was running this little organization, and after that Judge Bazelon is adequately dispose of it and I don't want to repeat it.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.105" offset="3248379">I do want to come down for the second element and that is the aid component because here we have a very adequate description or adoption by the Court of our description of what the organization did since 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.128" offset="3336464">This is what the court below says about the Veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.534" offset="3350047">The Brigade says in its brief to us that since the latter date, its activities have consisted --</text>

            <text syncTime="844.098" offset="3376379">Pardon me, page 18 of my brief quotes the records, “have consisted of social affairs, statements in opposition to the Franco regime, the rehabilitation of Brigade members in need of aid, support of its members indicted under the Smith Act, particularly Nelson and Weissman, and defense of itself in the instant proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.626" offset="3482436">The report of the Board does not materially contradict this factual position,” I won't -- need not read the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.656" offset="3510544">Now, I submit to the Court that this is not the kind of aid to the Communist Party's objectives and purposes that were intended by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.383" offset="3565505">And in addition to what has been said by Mr. Forer and some of the suggestions that have been made by the Court, I would like to add the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.825" offset="3607197">I call the Court's attention to the principle of free speech laid down in Section 1 (b) of the statute that nothing in this statute be construed to impair freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.657" offset="3662576">I call the Court's attention to the discussion of Communist Party objectives set forth in Section 2 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.094" offset="3692356">And finally to Section 13 (f) (3) of the Act where it is said that the criterion is the extent to which is funds, resources, or personnel are used, further or promote the objectives of any Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.607" offset="3774380">Now, I do not think and I don't want to repeat the discussion that we had here but I will add something a little different.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.828" offset="3799249">Do not say how any of the activities that have been described here including opposition to the Internal Security Act which is the case before us including the defense in one zone members, unjustly as the decision of this Court have held prosecuted under the Smith Act or under the Pennsylvania Sedition Act and certainly the basic functions of this organization, the rehabilitation of the men who came from Spain and were sick and were ill and were homeless, those functions which were the principal functions of the organization and which constituted the principle part of its budget can hardly be said to be of aid to the Communist Party's objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.191" offset="3988689">Now, I've heard the discussion that we've here of course and I want to call the Court's attention to what we have said or rather what Congress has said in what we reported at page 31 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.977" offset="4059847">There, the proponents of this legislation Congressman Walter, Senator McCarran and others emphasized exactly the opposite arguments that that made by Mr. Terris and in a quotation, it does not appear in my brief but appears on page 3724 of the Congressional Record of August 29, 1950, paging 750, Congressman Walter pointed out that the basic objection of this statute was I'm quoting, “That its purpose was to police and to regulate not actions or conduct but thought and expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.632" offset="4250436">I say to you--” said Congressman Walter, “-- there is nothing in the bill that in any wise attempts to regulate thought or expression”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.535" offset="4286067">Of course if you take this one section and read the paragraph out it without regard for the other paragraphs of this section, it will indicate that this is objective.</text>

            <text syncTime="1215.614" offset="4862433">But they went through -- they needed rehabilitation of all kinds -- that has remained the principle function of the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.515" offset="4890018">And there's a footnote referenced to the budget and with somewhere out of $13,000 or $11,000 is used for rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.797" offset="4923141">Actually what has happened is that the organization like many other organizations in this last decade, dwindles so that it was not a very important organization although what it did was to basically continue in its functions of opposing Franco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.093" offset="4996284">If this organization could be set to be distinguished from all other organizations in the country, it would be that its position of being anti-Franco stems from 1936, it never changed before the pact or after the pact, this was its central, its raised on that draft, Your Honors can understand how that would be and view of this -- what demand had gone through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.620" offset="5090429">Then of course, after the organization moved, after the organization moved to the more recent period, it found itself as a defense organization defending itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.681" offset="5142674">And right now its principal activity I regret to say is defending itself in this very proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.511" offset="5181962">Now, the Government's argument that aid and support mean, aid and support, because there's an ultimate plan to help the Communist Party without any indication of a causal relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.938" offset="5255732">It seems to me it create a vagueness problem with respect to the terms aid and support, as used in Section 4 and with respect to the terms objective as used in Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.392" offset="5305469">And that we do not have in this case Mr. Justice Harlan the precision of standards which it then pointed out at -- pointed out at page 135 to 139 of its brief on the Communist Party case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.957" offset="5367745">And in the Communist Party case, the Government made it perfectly clear that the objectives of the Communist Party that it was concerned with was very different from what we are dealing with here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.435" offset="5421662">I just want to read one line from the -- from the Communist Party case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.793" offset="5447158">“We submit --”, said the Government at page 104 of its brief there “that Congress have the constitutional power to require disclosure from such organizations which are actively working to overthrow the government, and which together with the world Communist movement as a whole produce a grave danger that their purpose will be achieved”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.435" offset="5533675">And it is very helpful to read what the Government said in the case where it was attempting to have the Court uphold the constitutionality of this very grave statute to find that after its exceeded, in indicating the nature of the danger which deserve a decision of constitutionality that it then moved to the lesser thing which can hardly be called a threat to security of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.879" offset="5631478">And if one examines the four activities which were described in our brief, defense under the Smith -- of two people under the Smith Act, defense in this proceeding opposition to Franco, Spain and even opposition to the Internal Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.215" offset="5696784">I suggest that none of them can be said within -- within the contemplation of Congress, and as opposing the Internal Security Act, there's no law that says, “You have to like your hangman”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.345" offset="5749342">Now, the Government would make a radical extension and this I think is critical here and that's why I referred Your Honors to the Government's brief in the Communist Party case which is more important I think than this brief for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.482" offset="5809842">I think we can agree that the worst fears of the opponents of the Internal Security Act of 1950 have been realized, and I referred to President Truman in his veto message to Zechariah Chafee, to Senator Frank Graham and then of course Senator Lehman, that whole group, people who stood up and were afraid of exactly this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.172" offset="5912660">And then the late Senator Lehman and Senator Kilgore who propose a bill that are in some respect was almost worst and then it was adopted and it become a part of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.693" offset="5946723">We refer to the consultation and provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.045" offset="5960098">But they were very worried and the way in which the Board has preceded or the Government has proceeded here has indicated what exactly what they are afraid has just come to pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.332" offset="6009313">But I think the Court here has another test as to what is the right way to construe this statute and that is what were the views or responses of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.693" offset="6062707">What does Congressman Walter say?</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.924" offset="6071693">What does Senator McCarran say?</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.395" offset="6081515">And if the Board adopt there -- if the Court adopt their views, then the Court will agree that this proceeding should never been started.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.935" offset="6119654">This Court has carefully distinguished the Communist Party from all other organizations in America.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.734" offset="6162913">Now, I agree completely with the dissenting views stated by Mr. Justice Black in the Communist Party case and there is no suggestion in my position here that I agree that that decision was correct or that I believe that the selectivity of that organization would justify, but I am here addressing the Court which has rendered a decision, now I should be very happy to reargue, or let Mr. Forer reargue the Communist Party case if the Court are willing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.472" offset="6269806">My point is somewhat different, this Court has made the Communist Party sui generis, just as the legislature has done so, and having going to the point of distinguishing the Communist Party from all organizations as Mr. Justice Jackson did in Doud although not for the reasons suggested my friend Mr. Terris.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.997" offset="6363951">And as Mr. Justice Jackson did in detail and almost legislative detail in Dennis, as Judge Learned Hand did in Dennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.357" offset="6405329">And as indeed if we compare the opinion in Barenblatt by Mr. Justice Harlan with the opinion Mr. Justice Frankfurter, concurred by Mr. Justice Harlan in Sweezy and even if we go to the internal operation of Communist Party and we compare Yates and Noto with Dennis and Scales, this Court has made a very definite judgment over down in history, legal history I don't know, a judgment that the Communist Party represents a special danger which every agency of the Government has a right to protect the people against.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.007" offset="6559974">And the findings and the Subversive Activities Control Act, that's the act of terrorism, of a desire to have a totalitarian government in the United States although not by totalitarian means of course.</text>

            <text syncTime="1772.706" offset="7090782">Now, the Government had made reference to Mr. Justice Jackson's views in Doud or Dennis as I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.841" offset="7139265">Dennis it must have been as to the dangers of overthrow in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, which justifies in the Government's view the current actions against so-called Communist-front organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.147" offset="7204571">When Your Honors look at what Mr. Justice Jackson said, Your Honors will see that he was referring to a paramilitary organization as he described it at Czechoslovakia and Hungary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.034" offset="7260056">And he was concerned about the Communist Party and not about an organization which is engaged in opposing the Internal Security Act or an organization which is opposing the arrival of the mayor of Madrid -- City of Madrid to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.826" offset="7335288">We're dealing here with two completely different things and it's conceivable to me that the author of those telling phrases in West Virginia against Barnett would have come to the conclusions of the Government does, that an organization of this type engaged not only on the surface but so far as the Government is concerned had proven under the service as well, in perfectly legitimate activities that this kind of an organization should now be required to register and should suffer the various penalties that had been indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.511" offset="7490038">I do not -- I will reserve a few minutes that I think I have left for any response to the Government and I don't think it's necessary for me to go into the detailed analysis of the four criteria that have ben mentioned in our brief under Section 13, in each case of which I think no proof has been made out to support the application of the criteria.</text>

            <text syncTime="1903.074" offset="7612291">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.841" offset="7643324">I intend first to outline very generally the findings of the Board and then to discuss the sufficiency and the other evidentiary questions raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.284" offset="7681045">Mr. Terris will then conclude the Government's argument on the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.575" offset="7710198">Now, the evidence before the Board in this case consists of 4500 pages of typewritten transcript of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.701" offset="7746769">There are also over 300 exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.136" offset="7760457">The Board on the basis of this extensive evidence has written a report summarizing a good benefit, making its findings and conclusions which takes over more than, takes up more than 200 pages of the printed transcript or the printed record in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.418" offset="7849587">The Court of Appeals in accordance with its responsibility, primary responsibility under Section 14 (a) of the statute has carefully reviewed the testimony and on the basis of that review has affirmed the findings of the Board, the essential findings of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.739" offset="7950942">And in -- in that connection, I would like also to emphasize that the essential test has been explored yesterday and today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.008" offset="7987931">The essential test to be applied by the Court to reviewing the Board's order is as set forth in Section 3 (4) of the statute and that is whether or not the evidence shows preponderantly that the organization is dominated and controlled and operates primarily to give aid and support to the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.306" offset="8093153">The four types of evidence which Section 13 (f) of the statute specifies, wants to be taken into consideration by the Board are simply that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.619" offset="8138397">They are statutory requirement that in arriving at the ultimate determination, the Board shall consider those types of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.882" offset="8195448">Now, I intend to take up at a few minutes the specific or a couple of these specific contentions made in the brief and in an argument this morning as to the claimed differences and approach by the Court of the Appeals and the Board, and especially with the argument relating to the insufficiency of the post-1950 evidence and the Court of Appeals finding concerning Wolff and Fishman and whether or not the Board's conclusion, their functionaries is warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.572" offset="8358243">But before getting into those specific questions of sufficiency, I think that it's relevant to place those arguments in proper context and that is in light of all the evidence that was received and considered by the Board and by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.254" offset="8456986">Now, the International Brigades which became a part of the Spanish Republican Army in 1936 were setup in that year and the evidence in the case shows that the International Brigades were headed and controlled by the Communist Party, by the Communist International actually.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.991" offset="8571925">The leader of the Brigades was Andre Martin who was a leader of the French Communist Party and a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.421" offset="8617587">The second in command of the International Brigades was Luigi Gallo, now known I believe is Luigi Longo, and a leader of the Communist Party in Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.100" offset="8664398">The evidence, and rather extensive evidence I think, clearly showed that the Brigade had political commissars operated under Communist Party discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.514" offset="8709956">Its literature was censored and its members were politically indoctrinated and many of them urged to join the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.308" offset="8753215">As matter of fact, some of the members of the Brigade joined the Communist Party of Spain while they were in Spain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.945" offset="8783726">One such member according to the testimony was Milton Wolff who was in Spain as the commander of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.044" offset="8828134">Before he went to Spain, he had been a member of the Young Communist League.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.909" offset="8851540">While he was in Spain, according to the testimony of the witness, Hecht, he joined the Communist Party of Spain.</text>

            <text syncTime="4076.096" offset="16304379">What we say is the evidence is sufficient to show that the character of petitioner did not change.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.247" offset="16332904">Now, let me compare that -- let me compare this case to the Communist Party case on the same point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.808" offset="16371148">In the Communist Party case, there was extremely little Government evidence after 1950, very little.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.868" offset="16395389">In fact, there was not much Government evidence after 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.484" offset="16409913">There was enough to establish that character of the Communist Party continued as prior to 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.205" offset="16436767">The large majority that Government evidence was before 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="4113.399" offset="16453590">This Court specifically considered the same proposition the petitioner now advances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.688" offset="16474697">It rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.506" offset="16482011">We think that the same result follows in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.962" offset="16503745">I may say that we don't look to 1964 back to 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.983" offset="16519837">We looked from 1954 back, because it was in 1954 the hearing took place and the fact that these proceedings seemed to stretch on interminably as it was also true of course in the Communist Party case, going to hardly mean that Government has got to have shown evidence more recent than it would at the first time, otherwise we never stop the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.819" offset="16603220">We have to have another hearing and by the time that got up to this Court, we probably -- that would be staled too.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.435" offset="16625685">So that we have to look at it from 1954 and evidence in the late 40's for example certainly isn't very stale looking from 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.667" offset="16658599">Now, it looks like it's another era.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.538" offset="16682109">I'd also like to point out that in the Communist Party case the Government did not prove that the Communist Party have done anything illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.362" offset="16713352">The Government did show that in Dennis and as to -- as to an individual, in Scales.</text>
            <text syncTime="4185.059" offset="16740206">We did not show it in the Communist Party case, we did show that the Communist Party advocated overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.350" offset="16769358">We did not show enough to meet the aid standard, that proposition was specifically argued to this Court that we have not met the aid standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="4237.656" offset="16950544">Now I'd like to divide up the constitutional question into two parts, we think there are two issues before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.347" offset="16977293">The first issue is whether petitioner, whether the Board has the power to make a finding whether petitioner is a Communist-front within the meeting of the statute, thing else of finding and determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.707" offset="17034762">And the second and we think separate proposition is whether Congress upon a finding of the Board can require registration and the limited disclosure which the Act requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.693" offset="17090769">Now as -- and we think these are two separate propositions, I won't go into detail, but the Congress intended them to be separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4279.177" offset="17116682">It considered the mere finding the publicity of what these organizations were like to be extremely important.</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.747" offset="17146984">In fact one of the main themes in Congress was that was unfair to organizations, to have the Attorney General as he was then doing, labeling an organization as a Communist-front, putting on a list without giving full procedures, this was one of the crucial arguments for the Act as far as it applied to Communist-fronts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4307.124" offset="17228487">And therefore the Act provided full hearings, full procedural administrative guarantees, coupled with judicial review.</text>

            <text syncTime="5000.878" offset="20003422">At least that might be the kind of thing that might be intended to covered, the constitutionality would be a different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.834" offset="20027246">Now, I want to emphasize to the Court that we have been discussing something almost on theoretical level.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.645" offset="20054518">There is no evidence at all in this record, none at all to show that the activities that we're engaged in, certainly those beginning with the passing of the statute in 1950 had any relationship not only to the bad objectives attributed to the Communist Party but even to good ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.367" offset="20133407">There is no indication that we were even interested in helping the Communist Party and things with which we will be in general approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="5040.397" offset="20161515">There is no connection with the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.592" offset="20170292">The Smith Act thing stands on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="5045.250" offset="20180950">Members of the petitioning union were being prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.780" offset="20195056">And something act of -- of camaraderie to help them obviously, particularly against the statute that many people thought was oppressive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5056.712" offset="20226821">This organization was under attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.880" offset="20235494">This doesn't require wanting to help the Communist Party in order for this organization itself to survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.192" offset="20268722">In short, each one of the activities attributed to the petitioner, if analyzed objectively, are activities that would be rational for it to engage in, indeed, irrational for it not to engage in without any possible reference to what may help the Communist Party either in illegal objectives or in building up an image if we take that argument made by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5091.429" offset="20365688">Now, I want to come down to the factual evidence which is completely on our favor on the subject of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.756" offset="20390975">There has been a discussion here -- well, there are two aspects, first I trust the Court has not been confused by all the reference have been made, to what happened in Spain in 1936, with respect to a different organization, the members of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, the similarity in part and the names should not make us forget that we are dealing with an organization created here in 1939, of the survivors of the old group.</text>
            <text syncTime="5127.584" offset="20510302">Secondly and more to the point on control, there is no evidence in this record Your Honors that the executive boards which has been referred to by counsel in his oral argument and which is described in the brief even as something having an important part in running petitioner, this is what the Government says in its brief, an important part in running petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5152.792" offset="20611135">That executive board and its important part in running petitioner is segment of imagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.436" offset="20665678">Let me indicate Your Honors how that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.976" offset="20679889">The testimony and the record is that this organization was run by two people really by one, by Mr. Fishman who did not function in the organization as an operating head until 1950 and by Mr. Wolff as a consultant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.143" offset="20752509">Your Honors will turn to the record at page 106, it says, not that there was an executive board running the organization, the other principle office of the VALB, middle of the page, is the finding of the Board Your Honor, not just a discussion, is the executive secretary who was formally has provided the constitution, designated secretary treasurer, Your Honors will then see a footnote to the Board's own finding in which its says, the evidence shows and will so testify, that the executive secretary is now and for the past few years has been the principal operating officer, handling finances as well as most of other organizational business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.781" offset="20923037">And on the next page on 107, again the Board repeats, respondent has been operated -- operated for the past five years into the present but through two principal active officers, naming them Wolff and Fishman.</text>
            <text syncTime="5247.755" offset="20990955">And whatever reference there is to the executive board is a statement made somewhere in this record that it has that function since 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.424" offset="21029616">Now, where have we suddenly built up an executive board that exercises so important a function in the operations?</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.458" offset="21057829">Your Honors will recall a reference made to a letter, very ambiguous, hardly to propound on evidence rule or the clear rule of evidence required, a letter signed by a number of people which contains the word executive board is by no means clear that the word for the 40 executive boards were not signed by Mr. Fishman and Mr. Wolff, instead of by the other signatories as Your Honors will say.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.933" offset="21155631">But let me assume -- let me assume everything the Government says that there was an executive board, the Board hasn't found that it was running -- the Board below running this organization and let me assume even further that I'm wrong this and that the Board where to -- where to have made a finding that he executive order instead of the two individuals I've mentioned was running the VALB.</text>
            <text syncTime="5316.030" offset="21264091">What are the facts with respect to these individuals?</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.038" offset="21276108">I regret to say that Mr. Maroney was not quite accurate in his general statement that there was an executive board of 11, that there were Communist Party functionaries and they were running the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.023" offset="21316023">The evidence shows as follows, first, two persons on the executive board were forced Fishman and Wolff who as we say were running the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.939" offset="21355729">The evidence says to them if it is believed that it's quite fragmentary, if Your Honors will see from the record, we've cited it, is 1940 and 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="5349.249" offset="21396898">And we're dealing with the period, I won't say 1964, 1950 to 1955, as to them only 1940 and 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="5359.021" offset="21436082">Then you take four persons of this eleven-man executive board, part of the court below rely as being connected with the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.934" offset="21475683">Wiessman, Nelson, Smith, and Love, only four out of the eleven answered the question by one member of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.555" offset="21514136">And out of those four, how did Judge Bazelon dispose them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5383.057" offset="21532212">He said, as to Wiessman the latest evidence with respect to 1949, that's the most recent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.009" offset="21556036">Nelson 1946, Smith 1938, Love -- we've been disposed of Love I think to today in that sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="5457.483" offset="21829904">With respect to that -- well, there was no evidence with respect to Fishman but Your Honor will recall that the one reference that Fishman, the one reference to Fishman is the statement made by a witness that in 1940, some 13 years before the Board was taking testimony, there had been an admission concerning membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="5478.760" offset="21914958">I suggest, Your Honor that the presumption must wear out after a few years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.032" offset="21932095">Certainly, it should not last 13 years when based upon the fragmentary testimony of one witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5489.150" offset="21956545">Now, I have been discussing up to now and I think I have indicated to Your Honors that at the most, there were four people on this executive board of eleven assuming the executive board was in existence, assuming that its function -- assuming that its function contrary to the findings made by the board below that organization was run by these two men.</text>
            <text syncTime="5511.046" offset="22044108">And remember that the court below with respect to Fishman and Wolff found that they were not functionaries of the Communist Party or representative of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="5522.677" offset="22090606">So that we have nothing to show control by the Communist Party, either by its -- through the officers or through the members after 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.400" offset="22129580">Now as to the activities, there's no point in view of the time, I'm going into them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5537.740" offset="22150896">I merely say that I have look to the Government's brief to which my friend just referred in which he described that on certain pages, the activities if the organizations are set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.846" offset="22199380">He said pages 40 to 46, all of those activities seemed to me to be pre-statutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5557.437" offset="22229682">And then when I looked at pages 59 to 60 which he says a post-statutory, I can find nothing in those pages which reflects any activities to have any bearing at all upon the subject of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5572.106" offset="22288405">Now, maybe he can -- he can broaden them out and summarize, but there is nothing on those pages that supports the statement that this organization engaged in anything after 1950 except the things found by the court below, anti-Franco to the subject that mixed point of view here by the two gentlemen opposing us -- anti-Franco, antifascism, rehabilitation the principal function, defensive members in Smith Act proceedings, and the defense in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5606.428" offset="22425704">And a lot of answers are placed by the other side upon our defense of ourselves in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5613.974" offset="22455798">I think this will be the first case in which the defense of an organization has been held to prove that it was intended to be covered by the statute as therefore criminal.</text>
