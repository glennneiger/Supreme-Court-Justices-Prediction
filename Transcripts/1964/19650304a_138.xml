            <text syncTime="64.328" offset="257254">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.234" offset="272927">These three cases which are here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, raise two quite distinct questions under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.917" offset="323605">The first concerns the form of a ballot to be used in an election which the Board proposed to conduct among certain of the employees of the United Air Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.873" offset="367491">And the second question concerns the alleged or claimed right of a carrier to be heard on the kind of question of representation which arose in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.255" offset="428931">I shall consider the two questions quite separately because they're analytically distinct in the order in which I have stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.451" offset="465711">I think it would also be convenient that instead of simply stating the facts in the normal manner, I were to explain the relevant provisions of the Railway Labor Act as I go along and the state of facts because it is quite different from the National Labor Relations Act which we normally think of in this kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.216" offset="548780">The provisions of the Railway Labor Act that are relevant are set out beginning on page 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.383" offset="581486">On page 4, Section 2 Second provides that all disputes between a carrier and its -- or carriers, its or their employees shall be considered between representatives designated and authorized to confirm respectively by the carrier or carriers and by the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.797" offset="675109">Section 2 Fourth over on the opposite page, provides that the majority of any craft or class of employees shall have the right to determine who shall be the representatives of the craft or class for the purposes of the checker.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.958" offset="743758">And then Section 2 Sixth provides that when any dispute arises between a carrier and its employees, it shall be the duty of the designated representative or representatives of such carrier and of such employees, referring again to the representatives of the employees, to confer and respect of such dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.731" offset="842919">You'll note that throughout the statute, it speaks in terms of making a designation and almost seems to assume that there will be a designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.012" offset="887954">In this case, in 1962 after United Air Lines had acquired Capital Airline, a dispute arose as to who were the representatives of a class of employees known as the clerical, office, stores, fleet and passenger service employees or rather large and from some points of view, heterogeneous grouping.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.763" offset="983040">Some employees belonged to the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks which is the petitioner in one of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.551" offset="1010103">Other employees had been represented by the International Association of Machinists.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.257" offset="1032986">Section 2 Ninth of the statute on page 6 provides for that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.607" offset="1058377">If a dispute shall arise among a carrier's employees as to who are the representatives of such employees designated in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, that it's the duty of the Mediation Board to investigate and to certify the name or names of the individuals or organizations that had been designated.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.254" offset="1140924">And then further on it has provided that in such investigation, the Mediation Board shall be authorized to take a secret ballot of the employees involved or to utilize any other appropriate method of ascertaining the names of their duly designated and authorized representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.767" offset="1218978">In this case, the Board did determine to take the ballot and it proposed to use a form of ballot which it had used in thousands of elections for almost 30 years and the form of ballot that had been used by the United States Railroad Labor Board before the enactment of the statute which was of course an example the precedent before the Congress when it enacted the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.953" offset="1323781">I can best describe the conventional form of ballot by referring the Court to the very back of our brief, pages 64 and 65, just below the middle of page 64.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.938" offset="1391700">You'll note that official ballot; it begins by saying a dispute exists among the above named craft or class of employees, on the ballot in this case would appear the craft as I've described it, as to who are the representatives of such employees, designated and authorized in accordance with the requirements of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.881" offset="1479471">That language is taken from the first part of Section 2 Ninth which says "Where there is such a dispute, the Board shall do certain things", and in the language of the statute, the Board says, "There is such a dispute and where you're taking a secret ballot in order to ascertain and to certify the name or names of organizations or individuals designated and authorized for the purposes of the Act."</text>
            <text syncTime="395.060" offset="1580199">And you'll find that that language is just about the language in which it is instructed or empowered to do such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.495" offset="1613949">Then the conventional ballot did not have on it the legion instructions for voting and the next paragraph of my brief, a put a large circle around that, we come back to it, it's important, that was not on the conventional ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.682" offset="1678629">The conventional ballot having said we're -- we're directed to find out who are the representatives of the employees, gathered all the possible representatives, those that the agency knew had any support among the employees and asked the employees if you desire to be represented by, then in this case would come Brotherhood of Railway Steamship Clerks, mark an X in this square.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.684" offset="1778730">The next would say of the Machinists, if you desire to be represented by the Machinists, mark an X in this square.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.796" offset="1807151">If there were any other unions as thereof denied, there would be a similar line for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.581" offset="1830243">And then always, finally the line, if you desire to be represented by any other organization or individual, write the name on the line below and mark an X.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.215" offset="1876846">Occasionally and -- very occasionally but occasionally, an individual or another organization is written in and does quite well.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.536" offset="2030132">The Railway Labor Act guarantees the right of employees of the majority to make the designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.636" offset="2062524">It is common ground that there is no compulsion to make a designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.760" offset="2086975">Similarly, the form of ballot traditionally gave employees freedom to mark any organization they wanted to but there was no compulsion to mark a ballot, to vote at all, you could return a blank ballot or you could write on it none or a variety of other things at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="547.759" offset="2190942">It could and of course, one of the things that the Board has often done and still does is go around and have a card check which consists of going to the various employees of the union and they have employees mark cards, saying, "I designate the Brotherhood of Railway Clerk represent me" and the Board sometimes compares the signatures on those cards with the payroll if the company's agreeable and finds the answer that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.234" offset="2308911">The Board has it varying, of course, that's the essence of our argument that the Board has the widest range of choice in carrying out this function.</text>

            <text syncTime="817.076" offset="3268232">First, as the case has put to the United's brief because that's the case we're talking about, it assumes that those who vote for a particular union, vote for that union and no other, of course that never a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.360" offset="3325388">That's a wholly artificial assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.889" offset="3335523">It maybe true or it may not be true, but no election is ever been held that brings that fact out and most observers I think would say was the opposite of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.113" offset="3372408">Second, we would say that what inferences are to be drawn from a particular distribution of the ballot is most clearly something left to the Board and I will develop that that later and third we submit, that no court should enjoin the holding of an election, tying the whole thing up for what now is two years, it's likely to be two-and-a-half minimum, because of what the Board may do sometime and some distribution of the ballots that hasn't ever come about and so as the whole thing, it's entirely hypothetical and nobody can tell how it will come about.</text>

            <text syncTime="1155.396" offset="4621584">Well, the Board has three reasons for using this form of ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.470" offset="4645825">The first is that this is the form, except for the new instruction, this is the form of ballot literally that has been used since the year 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.794" offset="4703086">That includes the period under the United States Railroad Labor Board which preceded the enactment of the Railway Labor Act from the 34 Amendments which was the model and which -- and then the entire period from 34 to to date thousands of elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.516" offset="4770064">And there is unnatural reluctance to upset something that's been used during that period with, so far as anyone knows, a complete success.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.414" offset="4817607">Second, in many, I would guess in most of the elections conducted by the Mediation Board, the only substantial question is in fact, Who are the representatives of the employees?</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.495" offset="4873927">There isn't going to be a no union Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.992" offset="4883958">That's true in nearly all their railroad elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.190" offset="4900676">It is true in a good many of the airline elections and this form of ballot does, in a way, concentrate attention upon the question which really has to be decided by the proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1431.359" offset="5725414">The dispute was to reach its last terminal point when the administrative finding was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.462" offset="5745789">There was to be no dragging out of the controversy and other tribunals of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.965" offset="5767837">Now if there is any exception to that rule, applicable to the National Mediation Board, surely, it's no broader than the exception made in Leedom and Kyne to the National Labor Relations Board cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.333" offset="5825306">And there the Court said that it would interfere only if the Board had acted in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific provision -- specific prohibition in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.168" offset="5880581">But now certainly, this Board was not acting in excess of its delegated power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.348" offset="5897300">It was told to find who were the representatives and it was trying to find that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.365" offset="5921437">Nor can it be said here that the Mediation Board violated any specific prohibition of the Act, there's no specific prohibition against using this form of ballot, a well-known form of ballot at the time the Act was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.785" offset="5987056">Indeed, we think if I may turn back to the statute that the words of Section 2 Ninth make it abundantly clear that final authority to decide questions concerning the form of the ballot is vested in the Mediation Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.010" offset="6056020">It begins you'll recall, 2 Ninth, that the dispute shall arise and so forth, it shall be the duty of the Mediation Board to investigate and certify the names of the representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.857" offset="6095412">It shall be the duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.599" offset="6102309">That is the only mandatory language in Section 2 Ninth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.736" offset="6122893">Down toward the bottom of the page, it says, "In such an investigation, the Board shall be authorized to take a secret ballot of the employees involved or to utilize any other appropriate method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.955" offset="6187781">There's no compulsion to take a ballot and certainly, there is nothing said about the form of the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.651" offset="6218501">And little further on, the statute says, the Board shall establish the rules to govern the election and it would seem to us that the -- choosing the form of ballot and deciding what will go on the ballot is one of the rules to govern the conduct of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.103" offset="6296346">The legislative history we think, quite clearly supports this view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.579" offset="6318289">First, I've mentioned before that this form of ballot was well-known during the 1920's under the Railway Labor Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.727" offset="7022864">The whole of United's argument rests upon the hypothetical example that Mr. Justice Stewart and I were discussing earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.751" offset="7058913">As I suggested, one it assumes an artificial set of facts, two, it calls upon the Court to intrude into what would be peculiar in laying inference to be drawn by the Mediation Board and three, it's all hypothetical anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="1847.925" offset="7391608">I come now to the second question in the case which is whether the Mediation Board's order directing an election is invalid because the employer, United Air Lines and ABNE, the employees who don't want collective bargaining, were denied a hearing upon the group, the craft or class in which the election was to be conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.387" offset="7493486">The material facts are very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.326" offset="7505293">In 1947, the Mediation Board held broad hearings on the crafts or classes in the airline industry and it determined partly in response to United Airline's urges that -- and appropriate craft or class would be clerical office stores, fleet and passenger service employees, the group involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.429" offset="7609678">In this case after the merger, for time there was a dispute between the Machinists and the Clerks about what was the appropriate craft or class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.953" offset="7655758">But ultimately, they agreed upon the clerical office stores, fleet and passenger service employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.396" offset="7685538">And the Board said it would hold the election in that group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.083" offset="7704242">United and then a little later in the faithful ABNE that always comes along two steps behind, protested and then took the issue to the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.807" offset="7747187">The Board of course rejected the protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.547" offset="7758158">Neither the court below ruled upon this question or at least not explicitly you can find ruling and dismissing the complaint, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.538" offset="7798073">Now we submit that neither United nor ABNE was entitled to a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.488" offset="7825868">The question, and I want to make this very plain, the question is not one of standing of administrative procedure, constitutional due process in the procedural sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.369" offset="7877381">The question is one of substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.930" offset="7891696">Our position is that the objection of United and ABNE with respect to the group to be voted in the election raised no substantive issue on which they were entitled to a hearing because the Railway Labor Act gives the employees wishing to organize, in other words, those for whom the union speaks, the right to agree upon in the craft or class in which they will be represented as they did here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2019.096" offset="8076330">This is the view taken in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.503" offset="8089913">Unfortunately, I did not put it in a larger context in the brief and this left some of my statements open to contradiction which is a contradiction in the generalizations, but I think not really a contradiction when one understands what the Mediation Board's view has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.578" offset="8166296">So what I propose to do is to explain the Mediation Board's view of the matter and then Mr. Justice Stewart argue from the statute wide it is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.621" offset="8202449">Under the Railway Labor Act, there are at least three or perhaps more, I couldn't think of them all to begin with, now I think of three kinds of questions that may arise with respect to the bargaining unit or the election unit, only one of which was involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.487" offset="8281861">One question is whether all the employees that the union seeks to include in the unit are in fact employees within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.058" offset="8332225">Sometimes they seek to include people who are managerial -- in that -- where that issue arises where the claim is that someone is being included that isn't an employee, then the Mediation Board recognizes the right of the employer to be a party and to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.149" offset="8412578">And three of the cases cited in United's brief fall in that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.986" offset="8435879">Then there is I think analytically a second type of question that may possibly arise and that is whether the unit in which the employee is seeking to organize -- are seeking to organize is a craft or class, is a permissible craft or class or whether it isn't a craft or class at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.486" offset="8521874">That question is not possibly and never was involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.257" offset="8537025">The Board had decided in 1947 that this was a permissible craft or class.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.732" offset="8558864">It was a recognized craft or class on a number of airline systems and I don't -- I'm sure the Board had no question about that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.822" offset="8603272">Then the third problem since craft or class is a very loose grouping, is, which of the potential crafts or classes -- in which of the potential crafts or classes shall the employees organize or shall any election be conducted if there is need of one, and shall the employees be represented in collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.769" offset="8707030">It's that question and only that question as I see it that United and ABNE sought to be heard on or really sought to raise, in any substantial sense, before the Mediation Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.464" offset="8765753">Now our position is as I said a moment ago that with respect to that last question, the Railway Labor Board gives the employees speaking through their unions, the right to decide the crafts or class in which they will organize for the purposes of collective bargaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="2301.500" offset="9205969">Now what I wanted to bring out was simply that where there is a dispute between the two unions, then the Mediation Board frequently invites the employer to be present and to give any facts it has in it possession, to give any opinion it wishes to give, but it is there as it were as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.385" offset="9301473">It is never admitted as a party and that is clearly stated in the Board's opinions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2434.808" offset="9739180">I -- suppose that the Steamship Clerks should come in and said "We claim to be the representatives among this class" and the Board might have said, it may say, "Well, we don't know whether you're a majority or not," but we submit -- but it does speak for some employees, it wouldn't be there if it didn't speak for some employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.142" offset="9836565">And those that it is speaking for, say, "We want to represent this group".</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.049" offset="9864150">And I say that if that is a craft or class, the statute says that a majority, if it has one, in any craft or class has the right to designate the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.618" offset="9906469">Now an election must be held to determine whether it speaks for a majority in that craft or class, I agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.435" offset="9945652">But it comes in the first instance and says, "Well, this is the craft or class in which we claim to be a majority", and if it is a craft or class, there is nothing more for the Mediation Board to do except to find out whether it is a majority because if it is, then it is their representative, the majority of any craft or class have a right to designate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.530" offset="10030080">Now if you add one more union, they are in agreement as to which group it is and if either of them has a majority in that group, into that craft or class, it has the right to represent them and the only thing left to find out is whether there is indeed a majority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2789.125" offset="11156480">But the Board has never, in this kind of case where the two unions were in agreement in its entire history, allowed the carrier by its position on the craft or class to create a dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2911.275" offset="11645074">One is the amendments to the Railway Labor Act which brought the air carrier industry under that Act where enacted on April 10, 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.937" offset="11687706">That's Section 201 of Railway Labor Act which is 45 U.S.C, Section 181.</text>

            <text syncTime="2937.346" offset="11749355">Now there are two things I would like to point out about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.602" offset="11758341">One is that Congress just -- did not simply extend the Railway Labor Act willy-nilly to air carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.360" offset="11785404">When it adopted the Railway Labor Act for air carriers in 1936, it considered all of the various provisions and it did in fact not apply Section 3 which is the grievance procedures to air carriers that set up -- separate and distinct grievance procedure which accorded with what was going on in the air transport industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.588" offset="11874325">Also when the Civil Aeronautics Act was acted in 1938, the Congress once again considered the relationship of the Railway Labor Act to Civil Aviation and it wrote a specific provision into the Civil Aviation Act which was continued in the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, 401 (l), which makes it a condition of holding certificates that an air carrier comply with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3126.226" offset="12504816">But this -- these are -- these are situations in which the -- there's a variation from the established craft or class which the Board has set up when two unions come in and say, "We want to contest for representation within the confinement of craft or class," the Board ordinarily accepts it as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.124" offset="12596454">Now also on this question of evidence on what the Board had before it, I might point out that it's my understanding of the regulations that 35% authorizations are required if a particular group is represented -- is not represented, and 51% authorizations if it is represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.490" offset="12685897">And in this case of course, the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks submitted to the Mediation Board the requisite number of cards for a decision to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.450" offset="12737724">Now on the third point, I would like to make simply this that the Brotherhood believes that if the position of the carrier and of ABNE is accepted here that it will mean that the purposes of the statute will be completely defeated because the statute contemplates and specifically adjures the board, puts the command on the Board to decide these disputes, representation disputes and to certify representative within 30 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="3326.942" offset="13307716">The United's petition for certiorari raised two fundamental issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.738" offset="13326942">One was the craft or class and the second was the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.302" offset="13337182">They simply reversed the order in which Mr. Cox have spoken these.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.829" offset="13351288">I would like to devote the primary part, if not all of my time, to the craft or class question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.729" offset="13374903">I would like to state our primary thesis and then back off to review it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.988" offset="13391935">My primary thesis is that the carrier or employer has that degree of interest in the composition of a bargaining unit of its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.087" offset="13428297">It has such a potential impact on its organization, on its efficiency, on its way of doing business that the carrier is entitled to procedural, not substantive, procedural due process in the manner by which that decision is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.466" offset="13485767">And we are asking here no more than every employer as ever -- has always been accorded under the National Labor Relations Act and as I develop this, I will show that in this respect, the Railway Labor Act and the National Labor Relations Act do not differ in their fundamental purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.767" offset="13555043">Now I would like to discuss a little bit what the nature of the craft or class here is that we are discussing to show that our argument, our approach, our desire to be heard is not a facetious one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.824" offset="13591197">There is some hold of its substance to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.345" offset="13601332">The craft or class is composed of approximately 13,000 employees and three major classifications of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.833" offset="13631321">First, they're the employees that we might call the office and clerical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.243" offset="13644904">These include at the one extreme, such highly skilled employees as our electro -- electronic computer operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.250" offset="13676983">It includes our typists, clerks, receptionists, switchboard operators, employees of this category who have no contact with the public, but who are generally highly skilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.491" offset="13717943">The second category of employees are what we call the public contact employees, ticket agents, reservations clerks, vacation booking agents, station agents, passenger agents, employees whose primary duty is to be in contact with the public, representing the airline in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.694" offset="13786697">The third category of employees who are in this conglomerate craft or class are what we call ramp and stores employees and these are employees who are primary laborers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.665" offset="13830583">They clean the airplanes, they put the baggage on board, they take the baggage off, they handle the material in the storage room, they're primary laboring employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.059" offset="13868199">Now it is our contention that we would like to have the National Mediation Board listen to us, let us explain why we think that a single craft or class for this entire group is no longer appropriate if ever it was certainly not at United Air Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.554" offset="13926191">We think we can offer some significant evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.032" offset="13936118">Now it maybe that after the Board has heard our evidence, it may disagree with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.109" offset="13952418">But I quite agree with the suggestion that was made by Mr. Justice White that our right to procedural administrative due process do not -- does not mean that we are entitled to just -- to judicial review of that decision, and this is why this not a Switchmen's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.542" offset="14010096">We are not asking for judicial review of a substantive determination of the administrative authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.182" offset="14032666">All we are asking is that the Board is required to make the determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3590.307" offset="14361182">But one of these that I cited was Northeast Airlines, a 1960 case and there, the Transport Workers Union had an argument with Northeast Airlines about what the scope of the craft or class should be, whether it would include certain employees or not and they're finally tired of arguing with the airline and they filed a petition to represent the entire craft or class including everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.703" offset="14450730">Now there was only a single labor organization and the employer protested and asked for a hearing and a hearing was granted on what the craft or class should include there and I want to read one sentence from what the Board said in that case and no more --</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart Bernstein</label>
            <text syncTime="3671.912" offset="14687608">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.664" offset="14690638">Let me back off now, let me back off.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.532" offset="14710073">We have had this problem presented in the briefs Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.475" offset="14721881">Up to this point, up until two days ago the primary argument laid against United's position has been that the Board in fact made a determination here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.583" offset="14754273">It did exercise its duty and the duty that it exercised was to follow its 1947 determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.594" offset="14786351">Now we responded to that by pointing out that on this record, no such conclusion could be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.896" offset="14811533">However, the argument was made by the interveners, the Railway Labor Executives Association, it was made by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.653" offset="14838596">This is the way the Government argued its point and that it's still persisted in here by Mr. Highsaw.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.819" offset="14863256">Now the government says, however, the Board -- we concede that the Board did not make a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.753" offset="14886975">In fact, not only as it conceded but in their reply brief, they insist that the Board could not make a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.979" offset="14911843">They say now that since two unions agreed, that ended it and the Board could go no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.730" offset="14930860">Now if I could rely on that, I assume I would not have to show that the record establishes that the Board made no determination because this is now the thesis that the Government is advancing, but the other two parties, The Railway Labor Executives Association and the union, insist the Board did make a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.839" offset="14999301">So I will briefly have to review just what did happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.686" offset="15014661">Now, when United asked to be heard on this question, the Board responded by saying, you cannot be heard for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.973" offset="15051860">One, you can't be a party to the proceeding and two, the two unions are in agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.406" offset="15077564">They said that in two letters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.060" offset="15084147">They said that in a public statement and it's repeated in the affidavit of the Executive Secretary of the Board which is part of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.969" offset="15111837">Now we thought that made out of previous case that the Board had made no determination but simply accepted what the union said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.645" offset="15134511">But it was argued nonetheless that the Board did make a determination to adhere to its 1947 determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.380" offset="15169515">Well, in -- our brief sets forth what happened in that 1947 determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.582" offset="15186233">This was very early after the war when the airlines were expanding, three formative stages in the industry and nobody was quite sure where these things were going to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.158" offset="15224581">And the Board did after hearing, make a determination for four airlines, not including United that this bargaining unit would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.827" offset="15259272">In 1953 however, it said that because this was not being followed generally, it would have to reexamine the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.179" offset="15288633">And in 1956 it did and then observed that only six out of 30 carriers were following this craft or class and it did make a reexamination, and in fact, it did hold a bargaining unit appropriate of a part of a craft or class which had been found appropriate in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.693" offset="15362717">Now we pointed these things out in our brief and the response was that these were unique circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.103" offset="15388317">The affidavit of the Mediation Board here says that the reason for this is that the circumstances in these cases were unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.274" offset="15421022">Well, I submit to the Court that there is no possible way of knowing if the circumstances were not also unique here without some kind of hearing, with some kind of evidentiary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.776" offset="15475043">Now after this case started, in December of 1963, a dispute arose at Eastern Airlines, a dispute about the same craft or class, and there the International Association of Machinists said the Board ought to stick by the original craft or class.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.874" offset="15535438">The International Brotherhood of Teamsters asked for something else and the Eastern Airlines asked for a third thing, and the Board in that decision in December 1963, in referring to this 1947 decision said, "Moreover, in most cases, this trend is contrary to the early determinations."</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.894" offset="15627494">The early determination thing the 1947 decision and it again found appropriate a craft or class consisting of less in the entire grouping found appropriate in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.785" offset="15671066">Now we submit on that record, it can hardly be said that the Board has adhered to a 1947 decision under the basis of no hearing when in fact it has not followed that in these decisions to which I have referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.483" offset="15733864">Now beyond that, our record -- our affidavit shows that after this application was filed with the Board and it deter -- the application was for this entire craft or class, the IAM, the Machinists and the Brotherhood sat down and had a discussion about, again dividing it up in a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.909" offset="15811605">The ramp and stores employees about whom I spoke, the laboring group had been represented for over 20 years as a separate craft or class, and since 1948 they had been represented by the Machinists.</text>
            <text syncTime="3964.064" offset="15856222">And the Machinists resented somehow this attempt to take over their bargaining rights and combining them into this larger group, and there were some discussions between them about rating and collaboration with the company and there was -- out of this falling out that they agreed to have this -- the election on a larger group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.972" offset="15927798">Well, subsequent to that, in November of 1963 -- November of 1962, the two unions sat down again, and again tried to work out a deal to exclude the ramp and stores employees and there's a letter in the affidavits here from the IAM representative, to the Brotherhood representative saying that he had discussed this with the National Mediation Board and the Mediation Board said if the parties could agree to that, they go and have it that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.688" offset="16030720">So we think it's quite clear from this record that there has been no reliance by this Board on what happened in 1947, rather they have relied as the Solicitor says on the agreement of two unions and nothing else and I must -- I have to go into this to get rid of the argument that is still persisting here that the Board did exercise its duty and did make a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.026" offset="16112013">I agree with the Solicitor that the Board did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.796" offset="16123089">Now -- yes sir.</text>

            <text syncTime="4177.719" offset="16710844">The Act does not provide any specific guidelines for or oppose any specific prohibitions upon the Board in defining the electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.584" offset="16738325">The matter has been left to the Board's discretion to decide in a case to case basis in the light of the general policies of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.895" offset="16763507">Going on, Commissioner Eastman explained to the House Committee that in drafting the bill, consideration had been given to defining crafts or classes but that it had been decided to leave it to the Board to make these determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4202.801" offset="16811154">Well now, we cited that back in our reply brief and the Solicitor now says, we overly we misstated his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.684" offset="16834664">I simply paraphrased what he had said in our brief if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4213.641" offset="16854518">Now the -- I must admit that the Section 2 Ninth for the Railway Labor Act is not the model of clarity of draftsmanship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.398" offset="16889522">But I have cited a few what Commissioner Eastman said.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.645" offset="16898508">He said that it would be left to the Board to make these determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.845" offset="16911360">Now it is quite sure that there was an element of voluntarism because as it had been repeatedly pointed out, the industry was quite well organized at the time the Act was adopted, but the voluntarism was the voluntarism of all parties including the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.090" offset="16964336">In the 1937, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held void a certification where the Board did not hold the hearing to find out what the craft or class had been by agreement between the employees and the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4255.137" offset="17020447">The carrier is one of the parties to this as we see.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.187" offset="17036748">And I cite -- this is not in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.287" offset="17045107">I had no occasion to do it originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4262.893" offset="17051481">I didn't anticipate this change, 88 F.2d 757.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.564" offset="17074155">So the voluntarism included the carrier and it was reflected in agreements which had been made not something the employees did in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.092" offset="17104353">Now when the Wagner Act was adopted one year later in 1935, this was made crystal clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.551" offset="17134132">Section 9 (a) of the Wagner Act in adopting the Section, the Senate Committee, they're discussing how craft or class would be determined, at least to say about the craft of class, now this is the Wagner Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.390" offset="17197558">They said, obviously, there could be no choice of representatives and no bargaining units for such -- unless such units for such purposes are first determined and employees themselves cannot choose these units, this is the Wagner Act, because the units must be determined before it can be known whether the employees are eligible to participate in a choice of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.009" offset="17283971">This is the problem that Mr. Justice Stewart was inquiring about and then the Senate Committee goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.256" offset="17308944">The supervision is similar to Section 2 of 1934 Amendments to the Railway Labor Act and it cites that part of Section 2 Ninth which says, in the conduct of any election for the purpose herein indicated, the Board shall designate who may participate in the election and establish the rules to govern the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4343.156" offset="17372578">So one year later at least, in 1935, the Congress thought that it was doing the same thing in the Wagner Act with respect to agency determination of collective bargaining units as had been done the previous year under the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.990" offset="17431928">Now the Board thinks the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.053" offset="17440183">They have repeatedly talked about their duty to make craft or class determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4367.209" offset="17468813">Now -- and incidentally, shortly after the Wagner Act was adopted, this Court held invalid a Wisconsin statute which did give to employees the right to select bargaining units, that was in the La Crosse case which we cite in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4380.742" offset="17522939">Now the most recent significant craft or class case prior to this one was the case involving the pilots and the flight engineers at United Air Lines by which I'm sure that many of you are quite familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="4394.443" offset="17577691">There, a group of United employees, the flight engineers, who had been separately barred to organize on their own since at least 1949, had their own unions since 1949 where the subject to a petition by the United Air Line pilots by the Airline Pilots Association to enlarge the craft or class to take in the engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.668" offset="17666612">The Mediation Board held a hearing and it allowed United to participate on this limited basis to which the Solicitor has referred, and incidentally, the evidence of United was crucial in that case because obviously, the -- since the significant factors are the nature of the job, the community of interest of employees, transferability, the interchangeability and their training is the carrier who peculiarly has this knowledge and so they had to rely on what United had to offer in that case in order to determine the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4443.934" offset="17775700">Well, after a long hearing, a committee that the Board appointed determined that there should be a single craft or class, putting together the pilots and the engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.409" offset="17805584">You may recall that as soon as that decision was announced, the flight engineers of six airlines struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.678" offset="17830661">The engineers of United did not strike, they litigated and they made a little bit the same kind of argument that the Solicitor makes here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.069" offset="17860232">They said, we voluntarily on our own set up this craft or class a long time ago and you haven't got the right to change it, that's what they said and this was the argument that came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4476.505" offset="17905998">The District Court dismissed their petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.036" offset="17912059">The Court of Appeals dismissed and they applied for certiorari in this Court and in the opposition to cert, the petition and opposition of certiorari here, the Mediation Board discussed that argument and said this to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4494.134" offset="17976529">The petitioner relies in the fact that a representative of the flight engineer had passed bargaining with the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4498.839" offset="17995337">However, Congress has charged the Board or its committee with a duty to find the craft or class to be whatever it is and not what it used to be and they went on to say, where the job has changed because of technological development, then the Board must recognize a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="4516.713" offset="18066808">Well, I submit that the Board must do the same thing here and how is it to know unless it has a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.062" offset="18084153">It cannot sit back and rely in the fact that two unions, after a squabble between themselves, agreed on where to draw the battle lines, that tells nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.554" offset="18118113">If the Board has this kind of a duty which has been charged to it by Congress, how can it possibly abrogate this to the accidental agreement of two unions in this kind of a point?</text>
            <text syncTime="4550.662" offset="18202645">Now, I have referred to the Northeast case where I've shown that the Board practice has been inconsistent with the Board position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.362" offset="18229394">There is currently going on at this very time, a craft or class hearing involving United Air Lines, Eastern Airlines and Seaboard World Airlines, an attempt of a union to carve out of the mechanics craft or class, a part of the skilled employees of this group.</text>
            <text syncTime="4575.551" offset="18302119">The N.M.B. is conducting a hearing on that and not only are the airlines participating as interested witnesses, they have entered their appearances as parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="4584.332" offset="18337228">They have put evidence on and in fact, they had been the first parties to present their -- the evidence of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.571" offset="18358230">Now the reason is quite clear as I pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.371" offset="18365440">There is no possible way that you can know how these things should be determined unless you rely on the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4597.012" offset="18388010">And this is what the Board said in this Eastern Airline case that was decided in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="4608.320" offset="18433254">And in this quotation, they give lip service to the point that the carrier can't really be a party and then going on to say that he really is a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.545" offset="18462093">Eastern Airlines and I'm quoting for the Board determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.968" offset="18471811">"Eastern Airlines, the carrier here involved, contends for a grouping of employees contrary to either of the contesting unions."</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.530" offset="18498038">Now if the Solicitor was right, you'll think that the limits of the dispute would be what the two unions want, but here, Eastern Airlines had a third position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.445" offset="18525727">"It should be observed", continues the Board, "That under the Railway Labor Act, the carrier is not a party in representation disputes".</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.628" offset="18550491">This is a disclaimer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.156" offset="18556552">However, in the Board's investigation of such matters under Section 2 Ninth of the Act, it must rely on the carrier for information needed in considering dispute -- the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.867" offset="18603468">Accordingly, the views of the carrier on matters of this nature had been received and taken into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="4656.312" offset="18625202">Now, I submit that there's no other possible way for fulfilling the mandate of the statute for the Board to exercise its discretion to make a craft or class determination then to do just this.</text>

            <text syncTime="5317.612" offset="21270361">The fact of the matter was that when the Railway Labor Act and the -- and both the National Labor Relations Act were first adopted, the -- the position of the Board both was that a union would be certified only if -- if it received an absolute majority of all the eligible voters and at such a time, having no on the ballot was a meaningless point because you have to have an absolute number of votes cast.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.466" offset="21353848">And so, whether an employee didn't vote or voted no was a matter of indifference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5343.413" offset="21373597">But then in the Virginian case, a -- an attack was made against the National Mediation Board that it had certified a union on the basis of less than a majority of the votes cast and hence was in conflict with Section 2 Fourth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5357.282" offset="21429081">But there, a majority had participated although majority had not voted for the union that it was served by, it was a majority of a majority and the Court said, the Supreme Court at that point said that this is perfectly permissible because the non-voter will be presumed to have ascended to the will of the majority of those who did vote otherwise, you could frustrate the elective process indefinitely by the indifferent voter simply staying away.</text>
            <text syncTime="5381.955" offset="21527719">Now, this was the justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="5383.946" offset="21535765">In 1947, in the opinion of Attorney General Clark, this was repeated when the Board asked his advice on its voting procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5392.312" offset="21569202">Now, we submit that if you justify certifying on the basis of less than an absolute majority on a presumption that the non-voter is presumed to ascent to the will of the majority of those voting, you cannot at the same time say the non-voting is equivalent to voting no.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.876" offset="21631478">It's simply a logical impossibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="5410.167" offset="21640568">Now, we set out an example to show to demonstrate this in our brief, the Solicitor replies while we're arguing conclusions from facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5417.199" offset="21668780">What we are saying is that you must set up the machinery so that a rational conclusion can be made from the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5423.684" offset="21694694">If you do not allow a place to vote no, you can make no conclusion and no presumption whatsoever about the intent of the non-voter.</text>

            <text syncTime="5717.249" offset="22868950">If the Court please, I represent the Association here referred to as ABNE.</text>
            <text syncTime="5723.771" offset="22895073">We feel that the basic question presented by this case is whether or not the National Labor Relations or the National Railway Labor Act provides the employees with a fair and unequivocal right to determine their representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="5743.929" offset="22975634">We argue that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="5747.038" offset="22988069">To protect that right, we, the association, brought an action in the District Court for injunction which we were granted and we attacked the ballot form successfully as it developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5761.202" offset="23044807">We don't apologize for the amount of time that we caused to go by here on this election because it took us two years to get the National Mediation Board to state that the ballot that they had been using up to that time was unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="5776.845" offset="23107291">They have made a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="5777.881" offset="23111471">They made the change shortly before they came into this Court, it is true but they added something.</text>
            <text syncTime="5785.127" offset="23140415">The government has stated that the employees here have a right to represent to indicate their preference for no representation, in other words, to state that they would prefer to bargain individually with their employee -- employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.425" offset="23225678">Now, the way they say that we have that right is by refraining to pre-framing -- reframing -- I'm sorry, Your Honor, refraining from voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.472" offset="23281789">In protecting that right, they have consistently over a period of time stated in accordance with the Act that if less than a majority of the members of the class or craft fail to vote for representation that no representative would be certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="5843.934" offset="23375726">This is the conduct of the Board for many years last past.</text>
            <text syncTime="5849.799" offset="23399131">It's a fact which is likewise supported here I believe in contrast to the statements of the Solicitor General by the legislative history of the Act, specifically with respect to the statements of Commissioner Eastman, which were referred to by the Solicitor, which we have set forth on page 29 of our brief in response to the direct question of Mr. Huddleston as to the purpose of this bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="5884.285" offset="23537058">Commissioner Eastman -- and whether it was to coerce organization or not necessarily imply organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5893.255" offset="23573002">Commissioner Eastman said, "No", it does not require collective bargaining on the part of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5900.355" offset="23601319">If the employees do not wish to organize, prefer to deal individually with the management with regard to these matters, why, that of course is left open to them or should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="5912.232" offset="23648862">Senator Wagner testified to the same effect that's set forth in our brief in the House report at the time of the 1934 Amendments made statements which are likewise set forth on equal strength with respect to the right of the employees to function as individual bargaining agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="5935.200" offset="23740709">Now, the government consistently states that that right exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="5942.301" offset="23769130">We think it arises from Section 2 Fourth of the Act wherein it is stated that a majority of the employees in the class or craft have the right to determine representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5958.497" offset="23833913">We feel that it's the duty of the Board to determine the majority and then to fairly determine the will of the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5972.801" offset="23891174">We feel that the problem that arises, the actual dilemma that's presented by this case is the action of the board in stating and guaranteeing to us a right under the Act, a specific privilege under the Act guaranteeing us the right to refrain from collective bargaining, and then stating by virtue in this instance of the ballot or by virtue in -- in the Solicitor's argument of some feeling that the Act is less than neutral that they may in some way affect or obstruct or dilute this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6014.432" offset="24057626">Now here, in this instance, it's being done, we contend by this ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="6020.689" offset="24082704">Now it's interesting to note with respect to the discussions that took place in regard to the craft or class delineations, as they concern the rights of the unions to determine who and what a class or craft should be that in this instance, the instance before the Court, the association which constitutes a large portion of the employees' concerns, some 6000 plus were never consulted, were not given an opportunity to be heard, and the only instance wherein they would have an opportunity to express themselves with respect to the crafts -- craft or class would be at the very moment of voting.</text>

            <text syncTime="6868.662" offset="27474547">The Board would have to remain free to determine some appropriate course as to what should be done.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="6920.696" offset="27682691">Mr. Chief Justice, I will be very brief; just a few points with respect to craft or class that I think I should address myself to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6929.306" offset="27717172">First, there is apparently a difference between Mr. Highsaw and myself on reading the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6938.304" offset="27753117">And I recognize his connection with the world of railway labor which is to some extent is strange to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="6947.261" offset="27788957">On the other hand, the position we put forward and despite some unfortunate words on page 60, I think we put it forward quite consistently in our briefs, is that where the two unions are agreed and there is a something that can be called a craft or class then there is no question before the Board and that is my understanding of the Board's present view which has been over our brief and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="6976.590" offset="27906299">And we think that occurred particularly with the spirit indicated in Section 1 Fifth of the Act on page 3 which I'd particularly emphasize Mr. Justice Stewart, the proviso which after referring to employees in certain occupational classifications in the Interstate Commerce Commission, goes on and says that no occupational classification made by order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7006.925" offset="28027611">No shall -- none shall be construed to define the crafts according to which railway employees maybe organized by their voluntary action or shall the jurisdictional powers of such employee organizations be in any way regarded as limited or modified by the provisions of this chapter or the orders of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7031.383" offset="28125518">I think that reflects the philosophy that I was trying to explain and I would call in particular your attention to page 56 of our brief where we quote from Mr. Harrison's testimony, speaking for the railway labor organizations where he described the proviso as something which gave organizations of employees absolute freedom under this bill to determine and define the crafts and that's where they agree, we say is conclusive everywhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="7068.971" offset="28275879">Mr. Solicitor General, what can be obtained that the -- that the problem we're talking about didn't happen with others --</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="7076.064" offset="28304196">I think if you look and I'm sure you will in the brief, if you find the one union cases, there are four of them, are not at all this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7086.567" offset="28346201">Three of them including the Northeast Airlines case, very clearly were cases involving the matter of where these employees subject to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7097.916" offset="28391654">In fact, in the Northeast Airlines case, the carrier's contention as the Board summarized it was, all these employees are in fact supervisors of supervisors, therefore, they are neither subordinate officials nor employees subject to the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7114.640" offset="28458527">Now there is one case as we read them Justice White, involving American Airlines if my notes are correct, in which a dispute broke out which was essentially over the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement between one union and the carrier and the dispute was over its scope and the Board did, the thing dragged along and it couldn't get resolved and the Board finally agreed that it would hear it under Section 2 Ninth.</text>
            <text syncTime="7147.023" offset="28587990">It wasn't determining who are representatives in the sense of resolving a contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="7153.534" offset="28614113">It was interpreting the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="7155.692" offset="28622681">I don't think it was properly, strictly speaking a 2 Ninth case at all, but if it was, the employer had a different kind of right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="7163.524" offset="28654028">He had acontract and he was standing up for his interpretation of the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="7171.240" offset="28684957">The impending case as I understand it, there are two unions and they are taking conflicting positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7179.186" offset="28716722">In all the cases that we read from here including this case where our brief in opposition was quoted for the language that the Board has a duty, there were cases where there were two unions taking different positions as to the craft or class.</text>
            <text syncTime="7195.578" offset="28782237">And there's no question that the Board has the duty in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="7199.399" offset="28797492">I can illustrate this best by taking page 37 of the brief where, United's brief, where they quote from an opinion of the Court of Appeals saying, under the Railway Labor Act, only the National Mediation Board has the power to make craft or class determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="7217.016" offset="28868023">That was a dispute between two unions.</text>
