            <label>Mr. Frank I. Goodman</label>
            <text syncTime="10.271" offset="41064">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.456" offset="53812">I'd like to correct an answer I gave yesterday to a question asked by Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.952" offset="75755">Mr. Justice White's question was whether or not a supplier who wished to bid for this AEC business was required to submit two bids in alternative form.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.924" offset="123611">One based upon delivery at the seller's Bulk Plant and the other based upon delivery at the installation site in Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.576" offset="158302">Mr. Justice White suggested, I believe, that if that were true, then sooner or later the supplier would be required to get an Idaho dealer’s license.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.444" offset="193724">If not in order to submit his bid then at least an order to perform the contract if it were awarded to him on the basis of delivery in Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.193" offset="228728">The answer to the question, I believe, Mr. Justice White is “no”.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.789" offset="243148">There's no requirement in this contract by either expressed or implied which requires the bids be submitted in that alternative form.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.217" offset="280764">And in the absence of such requirement, I think its clear that they need not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.572" offset="298214">Item 63 and 64 which are the two AEC items involved here, each comprise two sub-items, A and B.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.543" offset="338129">Sub-item A in each case invites a bid f.o.b. the Bulk Plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.708" offset="358818">Sub-item B, invites a bid f.o.b. the installation site in Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.117" offset="380447">Just as a supplier is free to bid on anyone or more of the items in the invitation without having to bid on all 600 of them, by the same token he’s free to bid on either of these two sub-items without necessarily having to bid on both of them unless he chooses to do so.Obviously, it would be to the advantage of the seller to bid on both them if they were in a position to because that would give him two strings to his bow.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.690" offset="486713">But there's no indication in the contract that the Government would turn down the low bid if were say on item -- Sub-item A merely because it were not accompanied by another bid on Sub-item B.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.177" offset="544705">The upshot of this is that even if Utah Oil Company had never done a dollars worth of business in Idaho and did not hold an Idaho dealer’s permit, it could still a bid for this contract and it would still have been awarded this contract f.o.b. its Bulk Plant in Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.572" offset="622237">So insofar as this transaction is concerned, the State of Idaho has given the seller no benefit for which it can reasonably demand compensation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank I. Goodman</label>
            <text syncTime="177.166" offset="708650">-- (Voice Overlap) it submitted its bid, f.o.b. -- one bid, f.o.b. Utah and another bid f.o.b. installation site in Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.666" offset="738638">My point is that it was not required to do so and it could if simply submitted a bid f.o.b. Utah and that bid presumably would have been accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.712" offset="778762">And the argument is made that Idaho is entitled to tax this transaction because the seller does other business within the State of Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.566" offset="810214">As I was saying yesterday when time ran out, the decisions of this Court, particularly, the Norton case and the General Motors case made it clear that when a state taxes a corporation for the privilege of doing business within its borders, it may not include within the measure of that tax any interstate or out of state transactions, which do not grow out of activities of the seller within the state and which are wholly dissociated from any such activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.371" offset="925466">The burden of proof rests upon the taxpayer to demonstrate this dissociation or lack of relationship and in the General Motors case, the Court concluded that the taxpayer failed to meet that burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.657" offset="990563">So the majority of the Court held in the General Motors case that the State of Washington was entitled to tax General Motors on the unapportioned gross receipts from all of its sales to dealers in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.221" offset="1040823">Including those sales in which the dealers simply said its order to GM's zone headquarters in Portland, Oregon and received shipment directly from Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.556" offset="1082201">But the basis for that holding, if I understand it, was that General Motors had within the State of Washington resident sales representatives who worked with the dealers and who helped them to strengthen their sales organizations and expand their markets and those in state activities indirectly contributed to the very sales which the State of Idaho was trying to -- which the State of Washington was trying to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.844" offset="1179376">Now, in the present case, there's no such relationship between the sale of the Atomic Energy Commission and any activities which Utah Oil may have been conducting within the State of Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.669" offset="1222635">It's quite clear that this sale owed nothing to those activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.011" offset="1248026">It is true that Utah Oil made deliveries within Idaho to some of the other government agencies under other items contained in the same invitation for bids.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.850" offset="1299331">But as I indicated yesterday, the AEC transaction was totally unrelated to all of those other items.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.679" offset="1330678">The Government could have accepted the bid for AEC business and rejected all of the others or could have accepted the others and rejected this bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.836" offset="1363278">And undoubtedly, it would have done so had each been -- bid not been the most advantageous one from the Government’s standpoint on its own individual merits.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="350.895" offset="1403507">May ask if the alternative bid reflected the tax that’s here in question?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_i_goodman" startTime="358.096" stopTime="458.239">
            <label>Mr. Frank I. Goodman</label>
            <text syncTime="358.096" offset="1432346">Yes, Your Honor, it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.527" offset="1442064">The -- the bid f.o.b. installation site in Idaho included the tax, the bid f.o.b. Bulk Plant in Utah excluded the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.517" offset="1486054">I would point out too that the contract for the AEC business was not awarded even at the same time as the awards for the other items.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.987" offset="1523879">The other items were all awarded on September 15, 1959 whereas the AEC contract was awarded 43 days later on October 28th.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.863" offset="1571422">In our replied brief on page 4, I believe, we inaccurately stated that the time difference between the two awards was two days.That should have been 43 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.201" offset="1620741">Finally, I would note that all of the other items contained in this invitation for bids involved relatively trivial amounts of gasoline compared to the amounts involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.301" offset="1665149">The nine other items which were awarded to Utah Oil Company under this invitation involved a grand total of 18,000 gallons of gasoline whereas our -- our single AEC transaction involves 60 times that much -- 1,200,000 galloons.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.455" offset="1733799">And we submit that the mere fact that Utah Oil had earlier been awarded contracts to make relatively small sales to other government agencies at other locations within the State of Idaho, in no way gives the State the right to tax this transaction which was unrelated to those others in which involved no activities within the State of Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.511" offset="1821989">If the Court please, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.470" offset="1997845">I would suggest to the Court that what is complicated about this case, extremely complicated, if the Court please, is the factual pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.418" offset="2033580">And I would further suggest that this factual pattern is complicated because the appellants and the Government sought to and did make it complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.962" offset="2091781">I think certain guide post should be enunciated at the outset because frankly, there was a great deal of confusion in the briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="689.961" offset="2759784">And I would take that it is a established law now as announced by this Court that the fact that a tax is imposed upon a person who deals with the Government and at the ultimate result of that tax may be that the Government pays more for a product or for a contract because of the imposition of the tax upon some other person since the overruling of Panhandle is no longer material.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.767" offset="2879007">I would suggest also, that the one of the guide points in this case is that no tax is imposed until the gasoline is received in Idaho.</text>

            <text syncTime="1027.021" offset="4108016">This is some approximately 150 miles north of the Idaho-Utah border.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.194" offset="4132676">Phillips as a part of this operating contract for operating reactors and doing really complicated nuclear energy work of -- as a corollary event, or necessary corollary perhaps operated a fleet of buses, as a subject for transporting for hire personnel employed by it and other private contractors of G.E., Argonne Laboratories, Westinghouse, of other contractors who have other contracts with the AEC to do the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.055" offset="4264124">Varying in distances, they transported these employees from 16 or 18 tunnels in Idaho from distances varying up to 75 miles to and from work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.958" offset="4307801">I should point out that this reactor test site is located in a desert, a substantial distance from any community at all and there's no governmental housing at the site.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.473" offset="4349806">It's all from neighboring tunnels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.209" offset="4360777">This was done over highways located outside this test site which were constructed and maintained by the State of Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.324" offset="4413231">Now, appellant makes a point in its brief, in its reply brief, I think it's merely a carping argument, the Government had in its federal aid relationships with the State of Idaho furnish some of the money for the construction of these highways, and certainly this is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.661" offset="4486583">But I don't think the argument is really worthy of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.004" offset="4508003">The companies at that time in 1950, sought to avoid the imposition of the Idaho gasoline tanks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.343" offset="4549277">That effort failed after the rulings by the Idaho Attorney General's office and the rulings of the Comptroller General's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.839" offset="4583340">These rulings are contained in the record in the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.535" offset="4602044">And it was not until 1959 that another attempt was made to subvert the imposition of Idaho gasoline tax which is resulted in this case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.803" offset="4639138">In 1959, the General Services Administration as it had done in the past call for bids for gasoline to be furnished as counsel stated to some 607 government sites in the four northwest states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.344" offset="4697339">Now, I would point out particularly that out of these 607 governmental installations, it was required that gasoline be delivered to every single one of those sites with the exception of two those here, which has been stated, the bidding parties were permitted to bid in the alternative as to delivering f.o.b.

            <text syncTime="1463.873" offset="5855399">It had one purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.883" offset="5867520">It had one contract number.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.469" offset="5881835">It dealt with one item, gasoline, of one quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.785" offset="5919138">It was each item in that contract was subject to the whole plethora of governmental conditions imposed in contracts, the Walsh-Healey Act, the anti-kickback provisions of every kind and type of the many that the Government imposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.222" offset="5992803">And every single item in that contract was subject to the conditions set forth and yet appellant would have us believe that these can be severed, these can tossed up after one side, that they have no necessary relation to each other merely because the same product to be sold to the same person in the same quality, subject to the same contractual conditions was to be delivered part in one place and part in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.290" offset="6121117">And I submit to the Court that this is a strictly artificial device of attempting to sever this merely to avoid the payment of the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.587" offset="6158315">And I think the Court should view the contract to furnish gasoline to the Government by Utah Oil both within and without the State of Idaho as a whole because I can see no valid or logical reason for severance other than the artificial one of hoping to avoid the tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1589.384" offset="6357473">Appellant, however, is also a licensed dealer which status it sought voluntarily and while it is not an issue here, I would state that the Idaho statutes merely provide that one may obtain such status by paying a flat fee of $5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.615" offset="6430407">It is does not vary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.349" offset="6441378">And upon this basis Mr. Justice Goldberg, as you point out of the Idaho Court appeared to hang it decision that there was sufficient connection or sufficient nexus of this -- I would say, appears on the surface and perhaps it was unfortunate language by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.487" offset="6521940">But I think the Court meant more in its decisions actually when it's -- then just that it was a licensed dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.197" offset="6560705">Because I think the contract in the record here disclosed the more far-flung operations of Utah Oil successor to appellant here in Idaho, it was furnishing gasoline within Idaho at points varied over landscape by substantial distances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.304" offset="6645133">Unfortunately, the record is silent as to the precise number, if any, or miles of pipeline that the appellant owns in Idaho, the tank farms that it owns and operates, if any, the number of service stations it owns and operates, the amount of rolling stock it owns and operates in the state -- all of these things I suggest related directly to the sale of its petroleum products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.222" offset="6772820">But I would also suggest to the Court that there is absolutely nothing in this record to suggest appellant's contention in its brief, that the majority of appellant's petroleum business were done outside the State of Idaho.</text>

            <text syncTime="1879.340" offset="7517309">If sufficient connection or nexus exists between the person taxed and the taxing state, and as this Court stated in Scripto, some definite link, some minimum connection between the state and the person, property or transaction, it seeks to tax must exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.432" offset="7609678">And such a connection, it is our contention certainly exists in this instant factual situation, put in other way the cases asked, what benefits -- what opportunities has the State afforded this person or company it seeks to tax, an appellant raises the same question, and I would answer that in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.961" offset="7711765">First, appellant sought and gained a license dealer status which the Idaho courts states authorized the appellant to engage in the very activity which it now claims to be exempt in the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.672" offset="7762651">And secondly, appellant imports gas in Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.543" offset="7778116">It sells gas in Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.926" offset="7787624">This tax it seeks to avoid is a constitutionally dedicated tax which must be used for the construction and maintenance of highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.908" offset="7819598">And without such highways, I suggest to this Court, the appellant's product would have no value, no usage within the State of Idaho nor could it benefit him to import it into Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.386" offset="7881456">Thirdly, it imported a portion of the gasoline which it sold to the Government within the State of Idaho over these very same highways for which this tax is imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.409" offset="7937567">And fourthly, the gasoline was destined for and used to propel vehicles in commercial use over these very, again, Idaho highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.267" offset="7997022">Appellant stated that a large part of its case rests on Norton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.032" offset="8024085">I would suggest that there are substantial differences between Norton and this case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.466" offset="8045819">In Norton, the company shipping into the State as the Court observed manufactured some 225,000 different items which were ordered by mail and it also maintained a wholesale house so to speak in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.489" offset="8133904">And it sold these items through the mail to a myriad of customs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.971" offset="8163788">Here, one seller, one product, one purchaser and I suggest that if the Court that it had before in Norton, a factual situation where it had been one company dealing in product and selling to one customer that the result in Norton might have been different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.266" offset="8281025">I would suggest that very probably the language of Mr. Justice Clark concurred in by Mr. Justice Black and Douglas in that Norton case is extremely applicable here in view of the Government's attempt to assist this corporation in avoiding its tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.074" offset="8380291">I would suggest Utah Oil Company and American Oil Company forward in this language wherein the -- those dissenting Justices said in their point, “In maintaining a local establishment of such magnitude, petitioner has adopted the label of home-town merchant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.704" offset="8466808">After it has received the manifold advantages of that label, we could not give our sanction to its claim made at taxpaying time that with respect to direct sales it is only an itinerant drummer”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.089" offset="8528353">I think that language is applicable here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2614.421" offset="10457652">And the Department of Agriculture originally took the position that the Idaho tax was a tax upon the Government and therefore could not be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.622" offset="10498403">The Attorney General of Idaho then issued a ruling that the tax was on the dealer not upon purchaser.</text>

            <text syncTime="2637.904" offset="10551589">It wants to say that it can even impose the tax from the dealer as an out-of-state dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.135" offset="10584503">One further point, the State of Idaho relies rather heavily in its briefs and in this oral argument too, upon a series of cases ending with Scripto versus Carson, a series of use tax cases in which it is true, the Court has intimated that a state may require an out-of-state seller to collect for it a use tax imposed upon the in-state user so long as there is some sort of nexus with the taxpayer, not necessarily with the particular transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.887" offset="10719504">But this Court has never held that it could impose a tax upon the out-of-state dealer himself by virtue of transactions other than the one which is sought to be taxed.</text>
