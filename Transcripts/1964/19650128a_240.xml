          <heading>Argument of Bernard Dunau</heading>
          <turn speaker="bernard_dunau" startTime="0.000" stopTime="355.807">
            <label>Mr. Bernard Dunau</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.835" offset="23301">I said yesterday that extension of market operating hours means extension of working hours and that when you negotiate the one, you negotiate the other and I want to continue and say a few words about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.831" offset="95295">Except for a single proposal at the break up of negotiations in 1961, every proposal that was ever made for self-service operation was a proposal to have men at work at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.657" offset="154540">This was explicit in the proposals made either by Jewel Tea or by the other employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.305" offset="189127">The negotiations went to trying to persuade the union to have the men work at night and there were two parts, two essential elements of that negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.352" offset="237401">One, a flexible workday, that meant if you were going to have men working after 6 o'clock, how do you schedule them in for work.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.766" offset="278988">Do you schedule them in at nine to work through nine?</text>
            <text syncTime="73.508" offset="293930">Do you schedule them in at noon to work through nine?</text>
            <text syncTime="76.890" offset="307513">Do you schedule them in at ten to work through eight?</text>
            <text syncTime="80.746" offset="322978">The flexible workday was one of the major issues discussed between the parties and that issue went to whether -- not to whether the men worked, to when the men would be scheduled into work after 6 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.854" offset="383373">The employer's object was to get as they called it a completely flexible workday so that for the men who would work after 6 o'clock, you would schedule them in for work at noon, they would work there eight straight time hour shifts through nine and you would have no premium paid unless for the work after six, unless you negotiate a premium pay as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.489" offset="481907">And so the second element of the negotiation of the extension of marketing hours was how much if anything you would pay for the work after 6 o'clock and the proposals by the employers range from straight time which meant no premium for work after six to $0.25 an hour which meant $0.75 premium for working three hours after 6 o'clock to a halftime premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.578" offset="598309">These people therefore when they were negotiating with each other, were talking about men at work, how much you would pay for having the men at work and how you would schedule them in for work and the District Court's ultimate finding with respect to the import of the negotiations was this, at page 672.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.511" offset="689946">“Lifting the restriction on marketing hours would mean a return to longer hours and night work.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.185" offset="724637">This is evident from the face of the employer proposals which included the flexible day, night hours and wage premiums to sell night work and from the practices of the trade, particularly in plaintiff stores where night sales of fresh meat were authorized.”</text>
            <text syncTime="201.595" offset="806348">The district judge was referring to the fact that outside the Chicago area with virtually no exceptions when a meat department operated after 6 pm, men were at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.967" offset="851801">The Court of Appeals did not blink the fact that extension of marketing hours meant extension of working hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.684" offset="886700">They met that problem in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.059" offset="900180">They said the self-protective interest of the unions was limited to the number of hours a day a man could be required to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.635" offset="938527">Could you have them work more than eight hours, nine hours, ten hours, but the Court of Appeals said, the unions have no self-protective interest in what hours of the day or what days of the week they would work.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.544" offset="998087">You could work them after 6 o'clock so long as you work them only eight hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.870" offset="1015432">So if you started them at noon and work through nine, that was eight hours, you weren't being required to work more than eight, that was the end of your interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.310" offset="1053153">You could work them on Sundays because the objection there would go to what day of the week and that the Court of Appeals said was the employer's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.381" offset="1093486">In short, what the Court of Appeals said was, because the hours of the day and the days of the week that men would work, also controlled the hours that the business can be open, what hours the business shall be open, the Court of Appeals said, is the merchant's exclusive managerial prerogative, he determines that and when he determines it, he also determines when the men shall come in to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.392" offset="1209469">The practical import is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.736" offset="1222844">We know what happens outside the Chicago area where there is no limitation on market operating hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.519" offset="1253982">Jewel operates 33 stores outside the Chicago area.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.737" offset="1270909">In all but one, the market is open after 6 pm.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.938" offset="1291703">In two stores, the market is open to 11 o'clock at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.200" offset="1312705">In eight stores, the market is open six nights in a week, including Saturday night until 9 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.073" offset="1340291">In seven stores, the markets are open on Sunday and what the Court of Appeals is telling us is that we have no self-protective interest in bargaining about not working until 11 o'clock at night and not working on Saturdays until 9 o'clock and not working on Sundays.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.332" offset="1917283">In our view, the Court of Appeals faced this squarely and said the men had to work at night because the merchant wanted to stay open at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.919" offset="1951660">Unfortunately for that position, under the National Labor Relations Act, the unions have an explicit right to bargain about hours of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.005" offset="1987918">Their position on hours of employment can very well conflict with the merchant's position as to when he wants the store open.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.891" offset="2019474">When the merchant's choice is to when he wants to stay open conflicts with the man's choice as to whether you want to work and you settle it at the bargaining table and if you don't settle it there, to put it bluntly, you settle it on the picket line but you don't settle it in a courtroom as a violation of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.029" offset="2092095">Now it's quite clear, Jewel does not want to face to defend its judgment that it got in the Court of Appeals on the basis that the men have to work after 6 o'clock just because the merchant wants to stay open after six and so Jewel says this.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.301" offset="2153117">“We are perfectly willing to operate a self-service meat department without anybody on duty after 6 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.518" offset="2186031">That satisfies our wish to be open for business and your wish not to work.”</text>
            <text syncTime="553.274" offset="2213094">I said yesterday that the big problem they have with that contention is that the finding of fact is just the other way that you cannot operate a self-service meat department after 6 pm without employees on duty.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1215.544" offset="4862119">Mr. Justice Black and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.456" offset="4877793">The government's interest in this case stems chiefly from two sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.712" offset="4902766">The first it involves the interplay between two major federal regulatory statutes, which government agencies are charged with administering and second, the decision at least might the issues certainly do have a major impact upon the course of collective bargaining in the United States and it's for those two reasons that we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.190" offset="5008718">We are primarily concerned with the legal questions and not with the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.470" offset="5029825">I may say also by way of introduction that as we see this case, it's rarely a very simple case provided that it is decided in terms of the issues necessarily presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.868" offset="5095445">It's sort of a safe island if I may put it this way in the midst of swamp which is very foggy and very treacherous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.345" offset="5133375">Because I think the broader the proposition that it is advanced, the more difficult its implications and the greater the complexity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.967" offset="5179768">We submit first that the National Labor Relations Board does not have primary jurisdiction over cases alleging a violation of Sherman Act by a contract or combination between employers and a labor union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.075" offset="5256255">And that there was therefore no impediment to the courts below going ahead in deciding the case on the merits and no impediment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.848" offset="5287288">Our reasons are essentially very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.219" offset="5300872">First, we think that Congress has made it plain that there is no general rule that every question of interpretation of the National Labor Relations Act must go to the National Labor Relation Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.480" offset="5361894">Two illustrations come immediately to mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.881" offset="5375478">One is Section 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act, which as this Court held in the Juneau Spruce case gives one injured by certain union unfair labor practices, a right to sue for damages and questions of interpretation as well as questions of fact come up in those cases and the Courts are charged with the deciding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.954" offset="5471713">Second, suits for breach of contract under Section 301 often involve issues that might go before the National Labor Relations Board and sometimes involved and I think will involve with increasing frequency, questions of interpretation of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.900" offset="5547572">I think one case, I might take the time to use by way of illustration in which an employer sued contending that the failure to give certain notices in accordance with Section 8(d) of the National Labor Relations Act, automatically extended the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.637" offset="5622491">So he still had a right to enforce it and the union contended that, that was not the effect of the Section 8(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.829" offset="5651226">The Court to decide the case necessarily or almost necessarily had to become involved in the interpretation of Section 8(d) and one can think of and find in the reports a number of other cases of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.085" offset="5704307">So certainly the fact that a question of interpreting some provision of the National Labor Relations Act maybe involved is not alone enough to show that there must be primary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.031" offset="5756029">Neither does that necessarily show the reverse.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1445.594" offset="5782361">That involved -- yes, it involved the trucking industry in some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.110" offset="5804408">I'd forgotten that, but I expect it's very close to the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.116" offset="5820395">Our second reason for thinking that there cannot be primary jurisdiction here is that the National Labor Relations Act simply does provide machinery for resolving this kind of case in most instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.886" offset="5887478">It certainly doesn't provide satisfactory machinery and that is true for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.622" offset="5914436">First, it would seem to me that the overwhelming number of combinations of employers or contracts between employers and unions that might be alleged to violate the Sherman Act, would not involve any unfair labor practice and there is therefore no way that anybody including the United States could possibly take them before the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.102" offset="6012343">If I may refer to the Pennington case argued yesterday as an example, except for the little tail bit having to do with the protective wage clause, I don't see anyway unless Mr. Roundtree could have taken that case before the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.705" offset="6078798">There was no claim of any unfair labor practice by anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.343" offset="6093322">In this instance, the union's insistence upon this clause might perhaps have been challenged as a refusal to bargain, but suppose --</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1545.864" offset="6183393">Yes, but there might have -- but it -- let me put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.401" offset="6197603">There are many instances in which that couldn't come up and this might be one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.797" offset="6223099">If Jewel Tea had been willing to go along with what is said to be a conspiracy and I can't believe that the Congress intended or that the primary jurisdiction doctrine holds that when there happens to be some little incident of the case that could be challenged as a refusal to bargain collectively, then the whole matter in that situation and that situation alone goes before the Labor Board and the case which is 95% the same doesn't involve that little incident, may always go straight to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.654" offset="6358518">Now there are two other confirmatory things which seem to us part of this also they're not quite as important as what I said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.027" offset="6388088">One is it that there's a six-month statute limitation in the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.646" offset="6406583">That's an awfully short time for anyone to bring suit for an alleged conspiracy to violate the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.872" offset="6439393">Indeed, I'm afraid it's an impossible short time, unless you expect the Department of Justice to get around to bring a suit for alleged violation of the Sherman Act or I hate to say it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.883" offset="6487458">Again, another strong wind, after all, the person injured by such an alleged conspiracy has no right to have his case determined by the Board, all he has a right to do is to submit it to the general counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.604" offset="6550361">I don't think that alone would be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.769" offset="6563004">There are instances where that's a complete barred of relief, but I think it tends to support in conjunction with the other things what we are saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.060" offset="6600202">I turn then to the other major part of my argument, the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.300" offset="6625176">We urge that upon the findings of the District Court which we think is supported by the evidence, the so-called marketing-hours clause does not violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.239" offset="6676898">Our argument has two steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.033" offset="6688078">First, although we say that the restriction upon marketing hours does suppress commercial competition among employers which we acknowledge is a fact, it also yields direct benefits to employees represented by the union in hours of work and what I will call job protection in not having their work done by someone else and that this is what I call a direct benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.288" offset="6813048">You get the more convenient hour or you get the work as distinguished from what I would I call the consequential benefit that flow in directly often to union members from a suppression of competition among the employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.374" offset="6877414">A price fixing agreement among employers may yield real -- very real benefits to the union because the employers to put it colloquially if they get fat, the unions could get higher wages from them and if they are lien then the unions find it pretty hard to squeeze anymore wages from them, but that I describe as an indirect benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.746" offset="6966962">It comes from the suppression of competition not as the direct consequence of the thing that you are bargaining about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.993" offset="7007922">We say first that this is such a contract where the suppression of competition yields the direct benefit and second, that such a contract does not violate the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.132" offset="7060480">Now the first issue as to what are the facts here is one that I really shouldn't concern myself about because those who tried the case and have studied the record obviously are more familiar with it, but I would point out that the District Court did find that this restriction on marketing hours was imposed at arms length bargaining and was fashioned exclusively by unions to serve their own interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.951" offset="7187749">How long and what hours members shall work?</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.009" offset="7199974">What work they shall do and what pay obviously meaning what premiums for overtime they shall receive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1834.870" offset="7339468">Well I would -- as I say, I think anything, any observations I make on this point are, I should acknowledge are not based on a complete study of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.266" offset="7376980">It would -- it did seem to us that this finding was supported by at least four bits of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.026" offset="7416059">First, there was the testimony of Kelly, the Union Business Act at R-603 and 604, which is unequivocally to the effect that you couldn't operate at night without having meat cutters on duty or without somebody else doing their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.592" offset="7498292">There was an operator of supermarkets who testified to that effect that R-415, 460.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.997" offset="7531938">There was also the evidence of the witness Sam Teller at R-493 and 495 who described his experience in the store, where in Indiana and said that he did get served at night during a time when no employees were supposed to be serving.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.025" offset="7616052">He apparently had better luck than Justice Clark was pushing about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.202" offset="7636741">Finally, there was the course of the negotiations themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.188" offset="7656699">The district judge found and I think he was quite right in finding, that the proposal for night work without employees, without meat cutters on duty was not interjected until the final moments of the negotiation when they were breaking up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.203" offset="7744784">Now on that, it said at page 15 of the respondent's brief, the Solicitor General's brief misreading the overturned discussion of the District Court, proceeds upon the erroneous assumption that Jewel proposed night operations without butchers being on duty only on November 16, 1961 as negotiations were breaking up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.610" offset="7850423">However, the undisputed record as to 1961 is that on September 29, the union asked what price the employers would pay for night operations, R-596.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.357" offset="7897339">I turn to R-596 and it said there that the union made certain -- that the employer made certain proposals, we want to know what kind of night operation we wanted -- that they wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.058" offset="7956167">We wanted to know about female help, it sounds to me as if somebody was going to be on duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.001" offset="7975915">We wanted to know about the ratios for female help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.428" offset="7989708">We want to know what price they would pay for night operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.027" offset="8004023">All of that sounds to me, price is frequently used of course when you mean wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.822" offset="8027220">I wasn't there but this at best as ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.693" offset="8046759">It certainly isn't evidence that a proposal was made for night work without employees on that occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.994" offset="8079882">Then we're told on November 2, the industry as a whole asked what the union position would be on night sales for three nights a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.376" offset="8113424">If it was assumed that all provisions of a contract had been settled except marketing -- at market operating hours, R-535.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.401" offset="8161593">There, we do read of a rather specific proposal made by the employers, asking about certain assumptions, what the union's position was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.146" offset="8204539">One of them was, the industry reached agreement to limit the sale of fresh meat to three nights a week, Monday, Thursday and Friday and no Saturdays, that's two in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.217" offset="8244767">Well now this again, it seems to me in view of the fact that always in the past, this had involved employees working at night, almost surely meant the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.141" offset="8288549">It didn't mean night operations with no employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.580" offset="8306312">But if I'm wrong about that's not just assumption in this instance, because if we look at R-454 -- 4 -- 554, R-554, that's explained in more detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.103" offset="8364408">Can you tell in some detail, this was the same employer with -- what Kelly said in response to your proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.879" offset="8391471">What proposal do you refer to?</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.437" offset="8397740">Well, when you asked him to make that assumption that all the conditions of the contract were agreed to and the industry has came in with an offer of three nights -- three nights of night operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.259" offset="8437029">There wasn't a great deal of discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.991" offset="8443925">The purpose of asking those questions was to find out, do you want one journeyman on duty or did he require journeyman on duty at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.386" offset="8481541">Do you want one, two or more?</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.289" offset="8493140">This wasn't night operation with a guarantee that no one would be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.934" offset="8515709">Then turning over on the brief, we read further negotiations were held on November 3 and 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.059" offset="8552176">On November 13, Jewel made the November 2, 1961 proposal on behalf of itself alone, R-538 and Exhibit 10.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.733" offset="8602854">If you look at Exhibit 10, you will see that it was an entirely different proposal and if you look at R-538, you will find that the witness was asked referring to November 13, did you make this offer to the union group on that date?</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.058" offset="8676206">Answer, no sir, we did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.495" offset="8689894">Now I maybe -- maybe they did and maybe they didn't, but surely the district judge was not on this in taking Jewel Tea's witness at his own word, that they did not make the offer on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.610" offset="8746423">And indeed, the same witness testified over on R-542 and R-543 that the time he gave it was on November 16, in answer to Mr. Juneau's question just above the middle of the page and over on R-543, he said this was at the conclusion of a very long harassing day and we were breaking up at the time it was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.811" offset="8859167">I submit that that is certainly evidence enough to support the district judge's finding on this point and that our assumption was not unfounded as it said.</text>

            <text syncTime="2344.857" offset="9379422">And the question I think is whether they were acting honestly with a substantial basis and whether they were entitled to bargain about the problem and the terms in which they seriously and substantially saw it without being charged with conspiracy rather than what the absolute truth is because surely the freedom to bargain about wages and other direct benefits to employees allows the parties some freedom to appraise the facts and to act on the basis of their appraisal of the fact, provided that it's done seriously, in good faith with some kind of a substantial basis, now I come --</text>

            <text syncTime="2428.020" offset="9712013">What we're talking about here is not what a union can do alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="2451.226" offset="9804904">As we see it, we start from this premise which is not directly applicable to the case but it's a necessary foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.935" offset="9843670">And that is that a group of employers and a union do not violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act when they enter into an agreement or call it a combination or conspiracy, when they enter into an agreement upon wages or hours of employment and other direct benefits to the union which have no effect upon competition and the producer's market, the selling market, except as a consequence of eliminating differences in wage cost as a source of competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2524.870" offset="10099461">No sir and you'll note that my proposition is for the moment quite narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.379" offset="10121509">I'm speaking for the moment only of the case in which the sole impact on commercial competition as Justice Stone called it, or competition in the selling market as I call it, is indirect because of the standardization of labor cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.238" offset="10196950">That's the case of every wage agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.868" offset="10207399">There are very marked consequences, but they're indirect consequences of the standardization of labor cost and we say that those effects on competition are not enough to invalidate bargaining about wages or about hours or other things that enter into labor cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.990" offset="10283886">We think this follows -- is supported by two considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.350" offset="10305306">First, we think as Justice Stone reasoned in the Apex case that this is simply not the kind of contract in restraint of trade that the Sherman Act referred to in using a word of art, that it was talking about restrictions on market practices and that wages, the labor market does not come under that count.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.803" offset="10399138">Second, we think that the national policy from the Clayton Act, down through a whole host of enactments including the Walsh-Healey Act and the Davis-Bacon Act, makes it plain that it is not national policy to encourage competition based on differences in labor standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.614" offset="10474371">Indeed, I'll go a step further and say that the kind of collective bargaining, we have had for half a century, but increasingly since 1935, simply could not take place if effects on the marketing of goods stemming from the standardization of labor cost were enough to constitute a violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.626" offset="10570501">Every national union and surely our collective bargaining has been founded on national union, looks to the standardization of labor cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.653" offset="10614596">Now I want to note in passing one qualification and one corollary to that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.824" offset="10647197">The qualification is that if it is shown that the agreement on wages, the combination for wages was entered into because the union was seeking to aid an independent conspiracy of employers to suppress competition and that is shown by other evidence, admissions if you will or something like that, that then we would make that an exception to our proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.163" offset="10788571">The Philadelphia Photo Engravers case cited in my brief seems a satisfactory example and we would also say as a corollary to the proposition that simply the fact that the union and the employers knew that a sharp increase in wages, coupled with an effort to extend it through the industry would result in the elimination of marginal firms is not enough to deprive them of the immunity privilege, not enough to put it under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.491" offset="10945933">After all, to say otherwise would simply mean that people who bargain without considering the economic effect are not under the Sherman Act, that people who consider all the economic consequences would violate the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.579" offset="11006224">And we think to bring a case within the exception that I stated, that there must be some other evidence than that of the negotiations and the agreement on the subject of wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.657" offset="11058573">Now that is not quite this case and I simply stated that proposition as the foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.974" offset="11087830">This case differs, because this agreement I think indisputably does restrain commercial competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.309" offset="11129208">It does eliminate competition based on differences in hours and if this were an agreement between the employers alone, the government's view would be that it violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, if nothing more than it appears here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.397" offset="11197544">Nevertheless, we think that what you have on the finding is a situation in which again Justice Stewart direct benefits to the employees and I wouldn't agree as you know that the phrase of the National Labor Relations Act was limited to direct benefits, that you must bargain with that, that where direct benefits to the employee are one side of the coin and the restriction on commercial competition is the other side of the coin and the two are as inseparably linked as we take them to be on the findings and as the two sides of the coin are then the principle that I stated a moment ago extends to the case and my reasons are much the same as in the first instant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.207" offset="11384790">The first reason that it's not the kind of contract isn't applicable, but the second reason I think, the policy of the labor laws is applicable, because there are a considerable number, we've cited them in our brief, of things that are traditionally are parts of collective bargaining and the essence of the collective bargaining, which both yield direct benefits to the employees and also involve a restriction on commercial competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2906.774" offset="11626998">Well if you mean that an employer agrees not to deal with any non-union establishments, even so the non-union establishment is paying higher wages than the union establishment and there is a no benefit to the employees in terms of wages, I would say quite clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.599" offset="11706305">In first place it isn't a direct benefit as stated by proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.988" offset="11723860">In the second place it's arguable that there's no benefit at all except by suppressing competition among the employers and we have the major difference between us and the AFL-CIO and the petitioners here is our insistence that for present purposes, anything laid down in favor of the petitioners here should be limited, we think to an instance where there are direct benefits to the employees on whose behalf the union is bargaining.</text>

            <text syncTime="3073.270" offset="12293016">If the union, instead of doing that, asks only for a clause that would protect its wages, asked the employer to promise that he will not subcontract parts that might be made in his shop to any other contractor who might make lower wage cost, I would say that, that too was a direct benefit to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.389" offset="12405551">If you want to take a case like Carpenter's case or the Allen Bradley case where the union was trying to do much more than that, where it was trying to protect its wages by keeping all goods out of the area so that the employers would get fat or if it is bargaining on two levels, the installation people and the production people, then it would seem to me that the benefit maybe only indirect and it would fall in the category of cases that we think the Court should avoid.</text>

            <text syncTime="3231.806" offset="12927164">So the union goes to them and says, we're going to strike unless you fellows enter into a scheme whereby who will bid is allocated for each job or they might propose a geographical allocation as is sometimes said to have happened among the roofing unit, that case while this does stem from the union's self-interest, and while it maybe arguable whether the Hutcheson doctrine doesn't immunize it, it seems to me that if the employers capitulate and agree with the union in that case, where the benefit to the union comes from the fact of having suppressed competition among employers and thereby enables them later to get something more, is a distinguishable case from this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.757" offset="13147011">Indeed, I would say that, that kind of case differs from the kind of cases that we see here in three important respects.</text>

            <text syncTime="4144.031" offset="16576052">Of course, the chief business agent from the union got up and said, “Well, we find that someone is always moving delicatessen items around.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.519" offset="16613982">The fact of the matter is that we have been operating in Indiana in an intensely congested area for several years, most of the stores, six nights a week until 9 o'clock and some of them until 11, with butchers on duty only for two nights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.380" offset="16701440">So that there is ample opportunity for cheating if cheating goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.723" offset="16734877">In their entire history, they couldn't come up with a single bit of evidence surely and so finally in the middle of the trial, they sent out a disgruntled former employee that we found engaging in unsatisfactory work practices.</text>

            <text syncTime="4231.123" offset="16924421">He went to three stores in that Indiana area, on a night when no butchers were on duty, he went there for the expressed purpose of finding what was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.081" offset="17024313">At the first store, 1755 and again at 6900 Indianapolis, the second store “Did you spy around and see if you could get someone to give you some service?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.054" offset="17072170">“Yes, I did,” “and you were unable?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.523" offset="17086067">“That is correct.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.365" offset="17093381">He got to the third store and he found not two grocery clerks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.879" offset="17111458">I read from record 499.</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.246" offset="17124937">He got to the third store and you find out on record 495 and he didn't get two grocery clerks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4289.601" offset="17158374">He got a meat apprentice who was is in the back room working on meat and he got this fellow to bring out the rump roast and he induced the kid to show it to him and then he put it down somewhere else and walked off.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.772" offset="17199020">The fact of the matter is that there is not a single bit of evidence, objective evidence in this record of any bona fide customer in Illinois, Indiana or elsewhere ever having been given this special service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4316.827" offset="17267252">And this is all under contracts that have elaborate grievance procedure in them and I am sure the members of this Court know that if there had been any substantial breach, these aggressive unions would have had us in arbitration after arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.438" offset="17325662">The last time I was before this Court was in a case that involved grievances over $2.19, the Sinclair-Atkinson thing was spawned out of such a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4342.875" offset="17371429">Now it is just idiotic to contend that these contracts aren't enforceable or that there is any amount of cheating.</text>
            <text syncTime="4351.592" offset="17406328">The real temptation for cheating is in the situation today when people can't get meat and when store manager would like to break his arm if he could to satisfy a customer who can get no meat at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4365.234" offset="17460872">Now it very well maybe the district that they offered evidence that it's not a satisfactory way to operate a store.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.155" offset="17492532">It very well maybe that we would prefer if we could to have the services of butchers at night, but the day has not yet come when if we want to run what they think is an unsatisfactory store, we can't run it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4388.245" offset="17552927">Our customers don't object.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.312" offset="17561182">The evidence proves that out in Indiana that the evening sale of meat with respect to the sale of groceries is at the same ratio as the day time sale when butchers are on duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.299" offset="17605172">But whether that be right or wrong, so long as we don't make people work when they don't want and they can bargain and say we won't work past 6 o'clock at night they can't restraint trade to the extent of saying, “You, Mr. Merchant cannot allow the public to come in the store and pick up that meat on which we have fully completed our task.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.326" offset="17705273">Now the issue is a very simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.512" offset="17718021">There is no question here of anyone taking anyone else's work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4433.582" offset="17734322">There is no question here of compelling men to work when they don't want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.686" offset="17758668">You can, of course, given an exaggerated reading to the Court of Appeals' opinion, but you will observe the Court of Appeals rendered two opinions in this case and in the second opinion, it went back and it re-adapted the first one and in the first opinion, it described these contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4462.003" offset="17848007">It described the restraining provision and it then went on and I think the line is significant, after describing the restraining provision, which prevents the public from buying from self-service cases at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="4482.603" offset="17930344">It says that the remaining provisions of the collective bargaining contract concern hours, wages and conditions of employment and it is precisely that thought that runs through both opinions and it is precisely that line that we think governs the decision that should be made upon this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.714" offset="18038805">The Court did overturn the District Court's findings of fact or example, and it was required to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.616" offset="18074436">When you have a record of successful operations without butchers on duty in Indiana and without cheating except this instance of entrapment or a Court to say that it isn't practical to operate a store that way is obviously contrary to the record, even though the Court was entitled, should be entitled to tell a merchant how to run the stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.307" offset="18169208">It's none of the Court's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.359" offset="18173388">If we want to run an unsatisfactory store, we do so at the risk of customer disapproval.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.433" offset="18197629">The Court of Appeals pointed out in its first opinion whether one form of merchandising or the other is the best will be determined by the customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4558.439" offset="18233678">That is the precise object as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4563.285" offset="18253113">The Sherman Act is aimed at is to let competition find the level it should be at, let the public determine from the various acts of the competitors what should be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4575.530" offset="18302119">Now, the Court said that we can set operating hours, but it soften that language and you will find in the second opinion on the same page as Mr. Justice Black read from.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.833" offset="18351229">It said furnishing of suitable hours is the prerogative of the management.</text>
            <text syncTime="4594.189" offset="18376725">We can furnish suitable hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="4597.158" offset="18388532">We have that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.060" offset="18392189">No one can tell us or should be able to tell us what hours we furnish.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.051" offset="18416118">We can't make the men work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4605.878" offset="18423432">We can't make them work in the daytime if they don't want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.283" offset="18437120">We must secure their agreement to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.358" offset="18449345">But they say, “You can't let anyone pick up that meat on which we have fully performed our task.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.978" offset="18479856">When they step over there they are not engaging in fixing a term or a condition of employment at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.590" offset="18522279">The labor exemption isn't a matter to be determined by theories or by what we may think in this courtroom is a desirable state of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.074" offset="18572225">The Sherman Act forbids all contracts, all restraints of trade and the exemption from it can come only in two places.</text>
            <text syncTime="4651.619" offset="18606393">It must come either from the Clayton Act or it must come from Norris-LaGuardia and either way, you read, any way you read those statutes it's limited to terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.392" offset="18661564">One says terms and conditions and the other says, terms or conditions and unless you can come within that language is a matter of statutory construction, then is this admitted restraint of trade necessarily falls under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.710" offset="18730736">I think this case is an atypical case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.809" offset="18751216">This type of retailing operation is different from a great many retailing operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4694.932" offset="18779638">Of course it's far different from the operation of a railroad where the railroad can't run at all if there isn't someone up there running the machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.322" offset="18817254">And to attempt to expand from these peculiar and rather narrow facts into the entire field of antitrust law, gets us into these perplexing problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="6088.675" offset="24354691">And we can take the position too and it is the position we do take, we can negotiate it, but there's a long difference between having the power to negotiate and succeeding in your negotiation, we think we might fail and that what I'll wind up with is an increase in workload by the same complement of people and we do not wish to risk that, that's one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6113.321" offset="24453224">Two and this is very important, we talk as if the only type of market that the union has to be concerned with is a self-service meat department operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6125.252" offset="24500976">There are two types of markets in the Chicago area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6128.918" offset="24515605">They are self-service markets and service markets and everybody agrees you cannot operate a service market without employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="6138.304" offset="24553117">This is not a conflict between independence and chains because chains operate service markets and independents operates self-service markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="6148.417" offset="24593659">But it puts us in this hopeless dilemma, either if you operate self-service markets after 6 pm, you either also operate service markets after 6 pm, which means the men must work or you keep your service market closed after 6 pm, which means that the service market loses trade to the self-service market and with the loss of trade comes the loss of employment and work.</text>
            <text syncTime="6178.617" offset="24714449">We do not think the antitrust laws impale us on the horns of the dilemma that we must either give up our right not to work at night, or give up all the butchers who work in the service departments, the work and the jobs they get if the market stays closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6196.722" offset="24786860">This turns right into Mr. Justice Goldberg's hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="6201.784" offset="24807131">Suppose we insisted because we didn't want to work at night that the service market stayed closed, aren't we then confronted with the identical antitrust action but on the other foot, now their complaint is we are suppressing competition between service and self-service markets by not providing the men to work after 6 pm.</text>
            <text syncTime="6222.736" offset="24890932">So whichever way we turn on this hypothesis, we are in trouble.</text>

            <text syncTime="6254.466" offset="25017783">The horns of the dilemma are this, in terms of a practical bargaining situation on what you do at the bargaining table, you are faced with two alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="6261.277" offset="25045055">If you say you can operate your self-service departments without employees, the service departments then say, “How do we operate after 6 pm?”</text>
            <text syncTime="6272.033" offset="25088104">You say, “Well you can operate.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6273.244" offset="25092911">That's one solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="6274.577" offset="25098240">If you operate, the men work at night and that's the end of the labor objective of no night work or, you can say, “Sorry, you can't operate without butchers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6282.786" offset="25131050">So you stay closed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6284.616" offset="25138364">That means we lose work of service butchers whose work and jobs to the self-service markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="6291.398" offset="25165531">Those are the horns of the dilemma that we do not think where the antitrust laws require us to be impaled on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6298.091" offset="25192281">Lastly, what this is all about, I think can be summarized in one sentence out of the minutes of the contract negotiating meeting in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="6310.296" offset="25241182">These minutes are in the record as an offer of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="6313.724" offset="25254870">We offer them in the record as one part of our showing that all we have here is conventional trade activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6320.372" offset="25281411">It was excluded from the record as a self-serving statement, but there is no question as to authenticity.</text>
            <text syncTime="6328.148" offset="25312549">Jewel wanted us to put to the men the proposition of working self-service meat departments without any employees on duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="6337.035" offset="25348075">We put it to the men, but with a recommendation that they turn it down and this is what the union's chief negotiator told the men before the vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="6347.806" offset="25391125">Secretary Kelly explained to the membership that in Jewel number one proposal, they would add to your workload, it would permit a seven-day operation around the clock, you would have to work ahead to stock the cases so you could sell out -- so they could sell their products after 6 pm.</text>
            <text syncTime="6367.993" offset="25471896">You would receive no extra pay of any kind for the extra work you have done and it would result in clerks doing your work.</text>
