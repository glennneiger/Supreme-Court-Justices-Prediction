            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="25.877" offset="103445">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.159" offset="116611">The question in these consolidated cases is whether a lessee of coal lands must share its depletion allowance with the persons it hired to mine the coal but who themselves never own the coal while it is was unmined in the ground or own the coal after it had been extracted.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.933" offset="207726">Tax Court decided this question in favor of the petitioner Paragon Jewel and against the respondent contractors, the respondents in 237.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.358" offset="253388">The Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.382" offset="265509">We brought supp certiorari on the grounds of conflict with Parsons against Smith in the 359th United States and the Commissioner who fiscally is a stakeholder agreed with us and still agrees with us and as Your Honors will doubtless discern in the course of the argument, they agree with us completely in result and only somewhat -- disagree only somewhat in emphasis.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.681" offset="386717">I shall take up first the facts found by the Tax Court concerning the agreement, the arrangements between petitioner Paragon Jewel, the lessee, and its contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.813" offset="439171">I will then discuss the statute because after all we are dealing here with a deduction that is accorded as a matter of legislative grace and yet the court below dealt with that deduction without discussing the statute without holding the statute and without even citing the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.686" offset="522658">And then I will take up the common law of depletion the decisions here to show that the entire emphasis in Your Honors' decisions has been that depletion is an allowance to the owner for the exhaustion of his capital investment of his capital assets and that therefore it isn't available to one who never had any capital investment in the minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.407" offset="625580">Let me first deal with the facts found by the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.698" offset="646792">Petitioner Paragon Jewel was the assignee or the sub-lessee of numerous coal leases in the hills of the Commonwealth of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.415" offset="689633">It is assumed all the obligations of the original lessee under those leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.701" offset="710740">It paid all the royalties, it paid all the property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.709" offset="726831">It never assigned or sublet any of its leases and it never surrendered any capital interest in the coal in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.199" offset="764761">I pause to say that the expression mineral in place, coal in place, oil in place seems somehow confusing to some of the lawyers with whom I have discussed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.936" offset="811677">I may refer to it as the coal in the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.301" offset="825156">I don't see that that's a word of art at all, that's perfectly quite.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.241" offset="840934">Now, Paragon made contracts with various individual miners to mine this coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.482" offset="869878">These contractors assume no obligations under the leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.139" offset="888477">They paid no property taxes on the mineral on any mineral interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.873" offset="907389">They paid no royalties under the leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.196" offset="916689">They paid nothing for the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.595" offset="926302">They got no title to the coal either in the ground or after it was mined and the great many of them on the stand expressly disclaimed any capital investment in the unmined coals.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.991" offset="975935">They got nothing by purchase or lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.737" offset="990877">They were not entitled to sell to anyone -- to any outsider the coal that they mine for Paragon.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.244" offset="1016895">They had to deliver every bit of coal they mine to Paragon at its tipple and in return they got the personal covenant of Paragon to be paid for their mining operations at a fixed price per ton.</text>

          <turn speaker="tom_c_clark" startTime="270.639" stopTime="273.965">
            <label>Justice Tom C. Clark</label>
            <text syncTime="270.639" offset="1082514">Any negotiation on this depletion item?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frederick_bernays_wiener" startTime="273.965" stopTime="471.156">
            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="273.965" offset="1095784">There was none.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.862" offset="1099442">No, it's plain that depletion is a conflict which I'll come to in a minute on whether it was terminable.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.315" offset="1121176">There was no negotiation about depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.971" offset="1139879">Actually, the depletion issue didn't arrive even in the bureau and even in the Tax Court after these contracts remained.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.045" offset="1188153">The price fixed by Paragon varied prospectively so that the contractors would know when how much they would get for the next ton of coal they mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.797" offset="1235174">It was not changed in the course of mining and not changed retrospectively and the Tax Court found that Paragon could and did change this price at will.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.561" offset="1282194">It found also that the contractors were not obligated to mine any specific amount of coal and that they were not specifically given the right to mine any particular area to exhaustion.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.974" offset="1339873">They couldn't be, because it was impossible to determine in advance what areas would be mined.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.109" offset="1368398">For one thing, any contractor could quit and the good many of them did.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.130" offset="1388460">For another the mining operations would uncover rolls and faults in the seams so that it was never possible to say at the beginning of the operation, you shall have this track describing it either by means and bounds or by natural monuments, it just wasn't and Paragon had an engineer to coordinate the mining of the several contractors so that they would work together, so that they extract all the mineable coal which Paragon under its leases was bound to do and so they wouldn't blow up each other's tunnels.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.884" offset="1531507">Now as determination, the Tax Court said that they couldn't say that the contract was terminable but by the same token they couldn't say it was non-terminable and they found that nothing was said about terminability at the time the contracts were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.024" offset="1604023">We think that last finding is plainly wrong because a year-and-a-half before any of these petitions for review were in the Tax Court, one of the respondents in 237 in two separate sworn documents filed with the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of all the partners in two partnerships constituting all of these respondents set under oath, the contracts specified the right of termination by either party at any time but the question never arose between the partnership in Paragon.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.016" offset="1763997">We say that in view of these ante motam litem admissions binding all the respondents that particular finding of the Tax Court is clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.350" offset="1801300">We don't have to rest on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.572" offset="1810286">Even without that correction, even taking the findings of the Tax Court as they now stand we say that on the facts that they found it is perfectly clear that there never was any transfer of capital interest in the unmined coal by Paragon Jewel to any of these contractors.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.406" offset="2041522">Oh, there's no question that was terminable at will in the first place a lot of these miners quit.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.140" offset="2060539">The record is perfectly clear on that and as a matter of state law, if a contractor is terminable at the will of one party, it's terminable at the will of both and if it weren't -- if the miners could quit but Paragon couldn't terminate them it would lack mutuality.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.167" offset="2152594">They didn't make it -- they made an investment, yes, but not in coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.325" offset="2173283">And if -- again, if I can soft talk, Your Honor, into buying the Brooklyn Bridge, that wouldn't convey title and that's what this was.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.372" offset="2209437">I don't know what they represented that they had to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.722" offset="2218841">They might sold them machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.770" offset="2226991">They might have said, “Look I put in all this wood and all this timber and that costs me a lot of time and money and blood and sweat and if you want to take my place you got to pay me something for it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="569.007" offset="2275997">Well, that doesn't mean they had any interest, capital interest in the unmined coal which by taking money from a successor miner.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.720" offset="2318838">They could then say to Paragon, “See I own the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.971" offset="2331794">I was able to sell it to the next fellow.”</text>
            <text syncTime="586.293" offset="2345169">These miners didn't own the coal in the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.457" offset="2357812">They admitted that.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.717" offset="2362828">They never made that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.353" offset="2369411">They didn't know that afterwards, after it was mined because they weren't free to dispose of it and the entire facts, the facts are completely consistent with the capital investment in this coal being in the lessee only and none of it being in the contractors and none of it ever having been transferred and therefore they are not entitled to depletion and the Tax Court so held following Parsons against Smith where these same arguments were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.869" offset="2503471">Now, the court below found a sharing of “economic interest”.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.207" offset="2532728">Now for that, we go back to the opinion in Palmer against Bender in 287 United States but those words weren't used alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.676" offset="2574629">What Mr. Justice Stone, as he then was, said an economic interest representing a capital investment in the mineral in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.838" offset="2623321">In other words, we don't care about legal title.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.046" offset="2632098">We don't care about the niceties of conveyances if there is an ownership interest and economic interest representing a capital investment in the mineral in place but here, the economic interest is in the enterprise, the economic interest of the contractors is in their machinery, it may be in their labor but they've never made an investment in the coal in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.042" offset="2744111">Now, let me go to the statute as I have said -- and as any revenuer can always make any tax lawyer squirm every deduction is an act of legislative grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.879" offset="2827494">Well then, we look to the legislation and yet in this case, the court below was able to deal with this legislated deduction without even citing the statute much less quoting it or discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.258" offset="2888934">Alright, let's go to the basic provision which is 613 (a) and I will read only short passages.</text>

            <text syncTime="739.109" offset="2956434">Section 613 (a) beginning of the third line.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.138" offset="2972526">The allowance for depletion under Section 611, 611 is the basic grant of that deduction, shall be the percentage specified in subsection B of the gross income from the property, so that it's a percentage of gross income from the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.491" offset="3045878">Now we go over to page at the top of page 4a which is Section 614 (a), property means each separate interests owned by the taxpayer in each mineral deposit in each separate track or parcel of land and I ask what mineral depo -- what interest was owned by these contractors in each mineral deposit in each separate track of this aggregation of leases the Paragon Jewel had assembled, the answer is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.886" offset="3191536">Now, there are additional reasons, statutory reasons that lead to the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.597" offset="3226331">For many years, there has been a provision in the tax statute going back to at least 1918 page 1a, in the case of a lease the deduction under this section shall be equitably apportioned between the lessor and lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.337" offset="3293309">Substantially similar language has been on the books for 45 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.217" offset="3320790">But by reason of legislation passed after the tax years considered in Parsons against Smith, there is no longer any apportionment in the case of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.021" offset="3371990">The coal lessor gets capital gains treatments on his royalties and therefore no longer shares in the depletion deduction which therefore belongs indivisibly to the lessee and I ask where is the statutory warrant for making the lessee share that depletion now with the people he simply hires to mine the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.234" offset="3468852">And finally, there are further sections also dating since -- from 1951 but sharpened only last year, which show that Congress understood very well the difference between an economic interest in the mineral and a right to cut or mine the mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.595" offset="3566341">Page 4a, 631 (b), the last three lines this is the timber subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.532" offset="3598106">The term ‘owner' means, any person who owns an interest in such timber including a sublessor and a holder of a contract to cut timber and a holder of a contract to cut timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.061" offset="3660173">But in the next section over on the next page 631 (c), the word ‘owner' means any person who owns an economic interest in coal in place including a sublessor and Congress doesn't go on to say and the holder of a contract to mine coal and that section was amended only last year in 1964 to include with the lessor of coal, the lessor of domestic iron ore and Congress didn't change that language, so that is perfect it is just as clear as it can possibly be from statutory language that the holder of a contract to mine coal is not one of those to whom Congress has extended the depletion deduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1025.267" offset="4101016">But when you're cutting like -- when you're mining coal, you are not -- the contractor is depleting the asset of the person who owns the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.372" offset="4141453">Now, in Parsons v. Smith where this thing was going into a great length, the key in paragraphs, the key passage is at page 220 of 359 U.S. and in the key sentences there and I'll read them briefly omitting the citation the word ‘owner' is used no less than three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.624" offset="4230478">The purpose of the deduction for depletion is plain and has been many times declared by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.463" offset="4257750">It is permitted in recognition of the fact that the mineral deposits are wasting assets and is intended as compensation to the owner for the part used up in production.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.556" offset="4310204">The depletion exclusion is designed to permit a recoupment of the owner's capital investment, the owner's capital investment in the mineral so that when the minerals are exhausted, the owner's capital is unimpaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.759" offset="4366942">In short -- and this is the conclusion of the paragraph, the purpose of the depletion deduction is to permit the owner of a capital interest in mineral in place to make a tax brief recovery of that depleting mineral asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.788" offset="4435069">And as far back as Thomas against Perkins in the 301 United States, the Court said ownership is essential, in the Bankline case in the 303rd United States, Chief Justice Hughes said the phrase ‘economic interest' is not to be taken as embracing a mere economic advantage derived from production through a contractual relation to the owner by one who has no capital investment in the mineral deposit, skipping, respondent had no capital investment in the mineral deposit which suffered depletion and is not entitled to the statutory allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.828" offset="4611239">Now, that language was taken over into the regulations and it's there pretty much in haec verba and it's there without substantial change today on the next to last page -- two next to last pages of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.188" offset="4668709">An economic interest is possessed in every case in which the taxpayer has it acquired by investment any interest in mineral in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.765" offset="4711027">A person who has no capital investment in the mineral deposit does not possess an economic interest merely because through a contractual relation he possess a mere economic or pecuniary advantage derived from production and agreement between the owner of an economic interest and another entitling the latter to compensation for extraction or cutting does not convey a depletable economic interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.710" offset="4822831">Needless to say this regulation was not mentioned by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.907" offset="4839549">Instead of which, the court below and the contractors here seek to find an economic interest by dropping the vital qualification representing a capital investment in the mineral in place and say because they have an economic interest in the enterprise and because they invested in things other than the coal and because they own things other than the coal which they can deduct under other provisions, they have somehow presto change-o made a capital investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.399" offset="4961593">We say that is a fiction, this Court said it was a fiction, this Court dealt with the -- this precise question in Parsons against Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.269" offset="5000986">This Court rejected the fiction, this Court said you must find a surrender, a transfer of the capital interest and since that transfer, since that surrender is absolutely lacking here except on a wholly fictitious basis we say with the Commissioner that the court below disregarded Parsons against Smith and that its judgment must therefore be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1334.368" offset="5337443">Justice Douglas, that depends on how you define owner and I will get to that very shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.507" offset="5358028">Okay, the simplest way of explaining what depletion is, is to look to its immediate predecessor discovery depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.121" offset="5396480">Ideally what we would do is we would value the value of a mine, the mineral deposit in the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.920" offset="5423647">Let's say that $60,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.576" offset="5434201">We would determine how many units would come out of that mine but say 100,000 units, and then we would divide one into the other and we would conclude that you got 60 cents tax-free recovery every unit you sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.932" offset="5499716">If you have a mine worth $60,000 coal mine, if we can -- if we could figure out you're going to go 100,000 tons of coal out of the mine, we would allow -- we would figure that the coal was worth 60 cents a ton in the mine and when you sold it for $6 a ton, we would allow you a tax-free recovery of 60 cents a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.178" offset="5580696">This very system discovery depletion was used for many years it was -- it has now been completely replaced by percentage depletion simply as a matter of administrative convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.966" offset="5623850">Congress now says in the case of coal that it arbitrarily assumes that 10% of the sale -- sales price of a ton of coal after it has been washed and cleaned and graded represents the value in the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.049" offset="5676095">The ton of coal sells for $6, Congress figures 60 cents as the value in the ground and they're going to give that back to the taxpayer tax-free.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.079" offset="5712248">You're going to allow them to recover that out of your sales tax-free.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.310" offset="5729176">The very nature of depletion and here Justice Douglas, I'm getting to your question dictates that the deduction goes to the owner of valuable rights in mineral in the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.503" offset="5781943">Now, I don't want to be too free in saying where I agree and where I disagree with Colonel Wiener because I'm not 100% sure that I'm certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.674" offset="5814648">What I do know is that the government doesn't care whether its property rights in the ground or contract rights for one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.298" offset="5845159">Many of the early cases involved are contract right to receive retain by the owner of lands who leased the coal and under state law the lease was equivalent to a sale of all the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.090" offset="5892284">They retained a right to a royalty of certain number, actually they're oil case a certain number of dollars a barrel that was held to be a depletable interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.600" offset="5934393">The government has moreover for many years allowed a purchase of such an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.677" offset="5954664">The taxpayer comes along and pays $200,000 for a royalty interest of $4 a ton in coal or $4 a barrel in oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.880" offset="5991445">He will obtain and running to exhaustion, he will obtain a depletable interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.870" offset="6015478">We say he has bought in to the value of the mineral deposit in the ground and we don't care whether he gets legal title under property law or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1547.524" offset="6190080">If you take a royalty, if you take $4 a ton, at least the government isn't firm on this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1751.123" offset="7004473">One is that the contract miners' rights must not be terminable at the will of the mineral lessee.</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.343" offset="7109277">The second condition which we think is equally clear is that a man has no legally enforceable rights to share in the value of a mineral deposit in the grounds if he has -- if he's obligated to sell it to another man at a price set by that other man.</text>

            <text syncTime="2314.925" offset="9259677">Now, personally I read that as saying they had a right to produce the coal and to be paid at a price which was in fact closely related to the market price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.681" offset="9294681">It is possible to read it as saying they had a right to have their price stay in touch with the market price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.613" offset="9330416">We think that when a mineral lessee retains the right -- make specific his right to change the price and no standard is set by which the changes will be measured, you'd have to find that he has the right to change the price as he wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.403" offset="9405544">At least at the very most he's obligated to pay the fair market value of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.149" offset="9428532">I was going to say that that was confirmed by three facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.714" offset="9442847">One that the miners didn't seem to generally know the prices Paragon was paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.247" offset="9460924">I wanted to quote from the testimony that I read to Justice Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.970" offset="9475866">And the three of the Jewel brief, there is an amicus brief in this case by Jewel Ridge Coal Company which shows a very good job of tracing its reply brief in particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.933" offset="9511706">It does a very good job of tracing what happens to prices of coal and prices paid to miners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.102" offset="9532395">They point out that on two of the nine occasions with no drop in price of coal that's perceptible at all, the miners take a 25-cent cut in price paid them per ton of coal and that's very sizeable break.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.344" offset="9589342">They just don't and -- above all, the record is devoid of any indication that the miners ever asserted a right to be paid a certain amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.522" offset="9634064">The most that happens when there's a change in price is they move into a bargaining posture and they don't even do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.467" offset="9657783">They don't have the power to do that, but no one asserts a legal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.151" offset="9672516">No one suggest they were right to evade anything except what Paragon tells them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.571" offset="9694250">Finally, and this I regard as nearly conclusive, if you were going to find a right in this case, the most you could find, we believe, would be an obligation to pay the miners the fair market value of their services including the value of the equipment they bring into the job and the value of the capital they contribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.989" offset="9779931">You couldn't find an obligation to pay them anything in respect to the coal in the ground which Paragon, the mineral lessee brought to the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.629" offset="9818488">I think Paragon would have screamed in righteous indignation if any court told them that they not only had to pay for the services and the equipment but also for the coal which they brought to the job, which Paragon brought to the job.</text>

            <text syncTime="2568.729" offset="10274900">The reason is depletion is recovery for the value of the coal in the ground not for the cost of taking it out, not for the cost of moving it and not for the cost of grading it and making it ready for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.955" offset="10323801">The only difference in this case is that the miners are paid on a piece work basis and we don't think that can be controlling.</text>

            <text syncTime="3169.582" offset="12678269">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.493" offset="12693943">I want to get one thing straight at the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.468" offset="12705855">This Court has very wisely held that ownership of the mineral in the ground is not essential to the depletion allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.766" offset="12735007">It has been written into the government regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.797" offset="12747128">What the government regulations say is that the ownership of an economic interest when this controversy started that government was neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.753" offset="12786939">Somewhere along the line they were persuaded to abandon their neutrality and I'm distressed to learn that the best reason that the Commissioner can give is that it was a bargain between unequals and they chose to take the big man.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.202" offset="12840751">I'll dare say that when the law of this case is analyzed, you'll find that the position of the coal mine operators who were the respondents in number 237 is more closely and more consistent with published rulings and regulations of the Commissioner and with opinions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.022" offset="12928000">The government went through its argument here without once discussing the most recent case of this Court which was Parsons versus Smith and the only case in which this court has dealt with the depletion allowance of a coalminer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.856" offset="12991321">I want to say this on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.044" offset="13004173">I feel that if I can adequately inform this Court as to the facts of this case that I need not concern myself the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.437" offset="13033744">It says that these general principles of law are to be applied according to the peculiar circumstances in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.382" offset="13065509">This Court has never gone into the question of drift binding from a taxation standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.255" offset="13089019">It's a practice that developed some 20 years ago in the areas of Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky when they learned that there were low thin seams of coal that the big mine operations have not been able to mine out and could not be mined with expensive equipment but they left themselves to mining by hand loading and that a small operator if he had enough courage and a little bit of resources that he could go in there and make a living at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.690" offset="13210749">It was high quality coal but it lent itself to handle loading rather than to machine loading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.027" offset="13236036">Now, this case is typical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.585" offset="13246276">One individual acquired a certain acreage of coal leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.877" offset="13263412">He then forms a corporation to which he transfers his leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.923" offset="13291624">Then the corporation develops what we call a processing plant to receive the coal, process it, load it, size it, enters into an agreement with a sales agent and a sales agent agrees to sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.342" offset="13345332">Now, that's what Paragon did in this case they were all ready to go in 1952 but lacked one thing that was production of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.908" offset="13379605">None of this was a value to anybody unless somebody was willing to mine the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.115" offset="13404369">Now, Paragon was obligated under its leases to mine this coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.465" offset="13421819">It also as a matter of fact -- practical economics had to mine the coal in order to survive but the difficulty was and this is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.658" offset="13462570">Paragon did not have the funds to invest in the production and mining the coal and its priced and dominant stockholder Mr. Claiborne said he would not expose his personal funds to the hazards of the coal mining business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.037" offset="13528085">Now why it's hazardous because as I have said this is a thin seam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.172" offset="13544594">The big coal operators don't bother them with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.856" offset="13555357">It never gets more than 30 inches high.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.864" offset="13567373">That means that all work has to be done in an area that's never more than 30 inches high.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.791" offset="13591092">You can't use this big expensive equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.304" offset="13601123">It's an irregular seam which means that it will be going on 30 inches high and the first thing you know it's pitched down until it's two inches high or pinches out completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.180" offset="13644696">Then you've got no coal to mine but if you're going to mine the coal beyond where you mine, you got to drive through the sandstone and the limestone which is a more onerous burden than extracting the coal itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.361" offset="13697358">It's necessary to develop these areas by hand loading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.850" offset="13715331">The men go in there and work on their knees and as I said, it's means by which a man of modern means in that area and assemble a workforce maybe of 20 to 40 individuals and make a fairly good living at it if he's got enough courage and if he's got a little bit of luck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.875" offset="13803416">Now, drift mining is as different from strip mining as night is from day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.600" offset="13822328">Now, that's a pretty good way to put it because when you strip mine you have all the freedom of good surface you don't have it when you drift mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.641" offset="13854511">We don't disturb the surface, we're not the people who make all this restoration of surface mining necessary and if all the coal, new mine comes out of one ton, one entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.564" offset="13910204">It's all done underground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.942" offset="13915742">Now, the Fourth Circuit says -- the court below says, our decision -- their decision's within the rationale of Parsons versus Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.872" offset="13951478">Paragon says it's not, the Tax Court says it's not, the Commissioners says it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.880" offset="13967464">Well let's discuss what this Court did in Parsons versus Smith and see how it compares with the facts in his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.222" offset="14000797">This Court reviewed the law, cited the regulations then came to the facts and it said first that in Parsons versus Smith, the investment was an equipment all of which was movable not in the coal in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.958" offset="14071745">The -- that was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.755" offset="14082926">The strip mining is no different than any large excavation job such as road building, bridge building or airport building and you have a certain problem moving your equipment on to the site, once you get it there and made a few minor preparations you're ready to go and you can be in production immediately, you just move the earth and scoop up the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.227" offset="14164846">Now, in both of those cases, in the Parson's case if the agreement was terminated by the coal owner, the coal -- the landowner, the strip miner had the right to mine and be paid for all uncovered coal in the Huss case the agreement was that the strip miner was obliged only to remove coal which lied a prescribed distance, more than a prescribed distance from the surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.633" offset="14290442">The point I'm making here is that their operation was predictable, it was premised on expensive equipment and it was perfectly proper for this Court to say that their investment was in their equipment rather than in the coal in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.060" offset="14352196">Let's contrast it with the facts in this case and I don't believe these facts are subject to dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.692" offset="14382707">Paragon was obligated to open, develop, preserve and produce the coal under its leases if more than anybody else knew the obligation it was placing on the mine operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.740" offset="14438922">It says, “We'll place this all on you and we'll encourage you to do it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.410" offset="14457626">Now I've outlined in my brief pages 5 and 6 and 11 to 7 deem what these investments were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.972" offset="14487824">I'll just outline them briefly here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.610" offset="14498377">There was a certain amount of preparatory work but had to be done at the mine entry, what we call the mouth of the mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.539" offset="14530142">This would take maybe from a month to six weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.307" offset="14541218">After that was completed they start driving them to mountain and remove coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.025" offset="14560026">The only problem they got is that the coal lying near the outside is what they call outcrop coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.736" offset="14586880">It's not marketable nobody wants it so it may go for 20 feet, it may go for 200 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.895" offset="14615510">They never know so they have to drive in till they get to quality coal that can be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.364" offset="14637453">The second problem is, it's low coal and no more than two or three people can work in an area and you can't have a productive drift mine with only two or three employees so you've got to expose enough working areas, working faces as they call it so you can engage an adequate compliment and make your mine profitable that you need to expose these.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.660" offset="14726583">Sometimes this takes six months, eight months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.922" offset="14743615">I'll show in a minute that in two of the mines here it took eight months before they got into what we call a production end of the business rather the than the developed end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.874" offset="14787396">While they're doing this, they have to comply with all state and federal regulations and these are very onerous, they are known to Paragon, they are known to the drift mine operators.</text>

            <text syncTime="3709.104" offset="14836402">You're going to have to drive an air course that will go from a separate entry so that air can be pumped through all of your working places.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.182" offset="14872660">You set a large fan at the mouth of your air course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.909" offset="14887602">It pulls the air through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.863" offset="14891363">That has to be in your mind constantly and if -- before you can send and compliment them in there, you'll have to conduct what they call a fire bust, running a gaseous mine, that is send a man through with an instrument to measure the methane content of the mine and then if it's inspectors says, it's alright you can send your workers in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.422" offset="14981642">Secondly, you got to provide for the roof of your mine and this is a real burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.167" offset="15012571">You got to support the mine because, and this is all in the record, once that mountain falls after you've mined an area of coal, if it falls in the coal beyond there is, if not lost, extremely difficult to obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.358" offset="15077355">You would have to go around by some circuitous course and obtain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.545" offset="15090103">Well, you support the roof by setting timbers on what they call 18-inch centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.143" offset="15116539">A timber is nothing more than a piece of lumber or a timber that four to six inches wide and as you mine you prop it up to hold the roof up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.786" offset="15171082">In addition, you leave what they call pillars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.889" offset="15179546">These are large bodies of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.136" offset="15188532">They would, sometimes as large as 60 foot square.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.498" offset="15201907">You have to leave them to support the mouth as you're driving back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.422" offset="15225626">In addition you run into certain adverse mining conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.115" offset="15240359">You'll go into your mind some morning and find it's full of water and no choice but to set pumps and draw it to the outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.389" offset="15265541">This may take a day; it may take two or three days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.949" offset="15279752">The worse problem one that always brings the miners down is what they call rolls and that's this situation where the coal squeezes out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.131" offset="15316428">They get in these rolls the record shows that one of these miners were in the roll for 87 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.901" offset="15343595">Now while he was in that roll he was not mining coal, he was mining rock and it has to be mined and moved to the outside of the mine and he gets paid absolutely nothing for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.638" offset="15394482">In addition, you have such things as bad top and other problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.216" offset="15416842">Now, these things I've mentioned are capital investments to my mind for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.009" offset="15447980">They serve the -- to enhance the value of coal in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.006" offset="15479954">Depletion is of value to no one unless somebody willing to enter into the production end of it and the development of the mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.093" offset="15512346">It needs no belaboring that point that a developed mine is worth more than a mine at the time you're initiating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3886.781" offset="15547037">These such costs all of which have been regarded not only by miners but by the Internal Revenue Service as development costs until a mine gets into what we call a production stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.844" offset="15599282">I asked the clerk to pass to you, to pass a little schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.867" offset="15623419">Now, this will give you an idea better than any words I could employ this is the Caiva mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.302" offset="15645153">It started in August 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="3914.628" offset="15658423">It shows the tons mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.325" offset="15669290">They didn't do any good in August and September.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.739" offset="15678903">They were getting ready to mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.959" offset="15687784">Then it shows their gross from Paragon, their deduction, their net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.859" offset="15707429">Nine months later at April 1955, they were $5400 behind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.836" offset="15739298">Now, this isn't their total investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.118" offset="15748389">This is the amount they put into the mine less what they received and I might say that this isn't my answer though.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.993" offset="15779944">This is an exhibit that Paragon put into the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.410" offset="15789558">They asked permission the conclusion of the Tax Court hearing to go down and check our records and make this exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3954.503" offset="15817979">The exhibit I put in which showed a much more unfortunate picture but I'll rely on theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.319" offset="15837205">It shows that after nine months of hard work, they're $5400 behind and there's another investment on top of this and I think were too inclined to talk about investment in terms of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.410" offset="15897600">It's easy to say we spent $200,000 for a processing plant or for a drag line but in addition to any monetary investment these men are full time miners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3986.740" offset="15946919">They're not gentlemen miners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.974" offset="15951830">They don't do their mining at the barbershop or other local gathering places, they're everyday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.664" offset="15982655">So in addition to what I have indicated there you have the services of three full time grown adult miners for 10 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.116" offset="16020376">If you'll check Exhibit 102, I believe it is, that shows the same history 102 is an exhibit which Paragon put in with reference to the steel well mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.323" offset="16077218">It shows the same type of history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.945" offset="16087771">You work there for eight or nine months before you're doing any good at all and at that time your probably anywhere from $2000 to $10,000 behind, plus the time you're out, plus the investment that you put no the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.932" offset="16159660">Now, make the statement that we'd explained any capital investment in the coal, that's not accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.077" offset="16188291">What they ask in the court several times was did you own the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.208" offset="16204800">You don't contend that you own the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.924" offset="16211696">We've never contended that we own the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.847" offset="16219324">I frankly, don't know who owns the coal while it's there in the mine but we didn't disclaim the fact that we had certain rights in the coal in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.423" offset="16257672">Now, let's go to Parsons versus Smith again.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.239" offset="16268852">They said there's and tying in with this question I just made, this point I just made they said the strip miners' investment was in their equipment all of which was recoverable through depletion and depreciation not depletion and Paragon picks that up and it makes this statement in its brief two or three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.867" offset="16343458">To allow the drift miners' depletion what enabled them to recover for the exhaustion of a capital investment which they never made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.357" offset="16373342">Well, I'll turn it around on them to allow Paragon the full depletion allows would enable it to recover for a capital investment which it never made because it specifically refused to make the capital investment essential to production of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.270" offset="16441051">Now, I -- we're not here saying Paragon does not have an economic interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.647" offset="16462576">They do have they made certain investments, they paid the minimum loyalties which were minor, they paid the real estate taxes, they established the processing plant and they had the right to receive the mineral but they did not make and they cannot find -- you cannot find in the record any place where they made an investment for the production of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.091" offset="16548362">They put that obligation on the contract miners and I don't like this double standard they talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.484" offset="16577933">Everything that Paragon has put into this operation they deducted for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.488" offset="16601861">You'll find that on record 84.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.541" offset="16610116">We ask their accountant, “Is there anything you put into this operation that you haven't heretofore deducted in some means other than depletion?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.118" offset="16644389">He said, “Nothing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.211" offset="16648777">I think there was some life insurance payments on their president's life or something but I don't think it's fair for them to say you've deducted these things so therefore you shouldn't get depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.301" offset="16693185">The fact is they've deducted every penny they put into this operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4252.505" offset="17009998">I said -- what I said and what I meant to say was that Paragon did not invest in the development and production of the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.389" offset="17057541">Now, under statute, coal mining is defined as including the production of coal plus certain processing factors that take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.753" offset="17102994">Now, Paragon did invest for the processing of coal and they had the right to receive and sell it but the point I'm making is they invested nothing for the production of coal aside from the minimum royalty and the real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.296" offset="17169136">The third thing that this Court mentioned in Parsons versus Smith was that the rights there were completely terminable at will on short notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4303.333" offset="17213231">In the Parsons case, the Parsons was a road builder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.806" offset="17235174">He went there and they offered him a long term contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4311.595" offset="17246354">He said I don't want it, I'm a road builder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.696" offset="17254713">I insist on a 10-day, right of termination in 10 days because if I get a good opportunity to go back to road building, I want to do it and they entered into an oil contract 10-day terminable on either side.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.402" offset="17313541">In the Huss -- and as I mentioned, if it was terminated by the landowner, he could extract all uncovered coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.722" offset="17342798">In Huss, the agreement terminable without cost and without liability on 30 days notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4343.023" offset="17372056">Now, let's go to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4347.241" offset="17388878">I think it's clear from the record that nothing was said at the time these agreements were made about termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.959" offset="17431824">Witnesses for both sides so testified and the Tax Court so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.297" offset="17453140">The miners were going there with the idea in mind of developing the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.523" offset="17486054">They knew and Paragon knew that they could not make any income out of this operation until they've been on the premises for at least four weeks and that would be in the event of the lucky situation and probably more likely than not that it would be a matter of eight months or two years so they both bargained with idea in mind that they would stay on the property, that was certainly the intent of the contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4399.477" offset="17597858">Now, they refer to this Exhibit 86 and 87 where it has a statement in there that well it says, “In two places that the question of termination never arose and then in the argument part of the protest there is some statement to the effect that the agreement specified the right of termination by either party but the question never arouse between the party for the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.801" offset="17699109">The Tax Court put no weight on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4427.283" offset="17709035">The court below put no weight on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.993" offset="17719902">It's an inconsistent document.</text>
            <text syncTime="4432.205" offset="17728784">The record explains clearly how it was developed, how it was created and the reasons behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.582" offset="17758250">Mr. Merritt testified with respect thereto and I won't burden the Court further with that at this time but I want to deal with this a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4450.389" offset="17801509">They say that some of the miners quit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4453.793" offset="17815092">That's -- we admit that a number of them quit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4456.718" offset="17826795">You have them quitting all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.011" offset="17832020">It's not an easy occupation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4460.508" offset="17841946">It's not for the fainthearted and it's not for those who do not have sufficient resources to see it through and if a man goes in and takes one of these operations and goes broke, he's got no choice but to quit but the point is when he quits, everything that he's putting to that operation accrues to the benefit of Paragon because when he went there, they had nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.545" offset="17942152">When he left there was the benefit of whatever work he had done and if he brought it up to a point where it was a developed and productive mine, then Paragon had a developed and productive mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.871" offset="17999412">And I want to put this point out, none of these people before this Court went.</text>
            <text syncTime="4503.578" offset="18014250">These people were going in there with the idea of putting their own money and their own efforts into it and they didn't quit and the record's also clear that paragon never terminated anybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="4548.021" offset="18191987">Then if they weren't able to make it, the next person taking over would at least 50% of this development worked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.360" offset="18225424">No, it's not likely that they would quit as long as the -- if they had it operating productive mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4564.905" offset="18259592">I think if you go back to Parsons v. Smith there's some language in there to the effect that the landowners did not agree to surrender and did not surrender any interest in the coal in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4576.229" offset="18304836">I'll agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.083" offset="18308284">They agreed to -- they gave a right to mine for 10 days to one, the right to mine for 30 days to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4583.189" offset="18332735">Here Paragon surrendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.160" offset="18348617">It didn't own the coal to start with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4588.824" offset="18355200">That did belong to landowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.474" offset="18361887">It was lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.972" offset="18367843">It didn't own the coal in the ground but it did have the right to remove it, reduce it to possession and to sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.196" offset="18392712">It surrendered that right to the coal mine operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.198" offset="18412774">Thereafter, they have the right to reduce, extract the coal, reduce it to possession and to be paid by Paragon for the coal and I submit to you that Paragon by entering into that agreement and putting the obligations on the contractor also surrendered a real substantive right in the coal in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.398" offset="18517577">The right to mine coal is a very definite interest in coal because unless somebody has the right to extract in these depletion cases, nobody is going to get the depletion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4640.828" offset="18563239">The argument has generally not been with the producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.673" offset="18574629">The man who is actually producing the coal is generally with some taxpayer who acquires a lease and then assigns the operating interest to another party for an additional interest of some kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.967" offset="18631784">It's generally a middle man that was the case in Palmer versus Bender and these other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.381" offset="18653518">There hasn't been any real question whether a producer have the right as long as his rights were absolute, as long as they could not terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.026" offset="18708062">I have already touched briefly on the point of ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.580" offset="18730318">They talk so much about ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="4684.159" offset="18736588">I'm not sure as just what they mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.374" offset="18745469">I regard ownership as a bundle of rice in an asset and certainly among the bundle of rights here, the coal mine operator certainly had the rights of real substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.381" offset="18797505">Let's get to the question of price and I'm sticking with Parsons versus Smith and that's the case the court below relied on, that's the one the government says doesn't control here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4714.053" offset="18856124">There on the question of compensation, the Parsons was to receive a fixed price per ton, Huss was to receive a fixed price per ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="4727.782" offset="18911086">In the Huss case, it was specifically understood between the parties that this would be as compensation for work performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4735.614" offset="18942433">The market or the sale of the coal by the landowners in that case didn't enter into the agreement between Parsons and the landowner in any way you can search the case from the District Court up and you cannot find where the market played any part with respect thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.846" offset="19023308">Now, this -- Commissioner's counsel conceded that at the beginning of these negotiations the operators were told that they would be paid a certain price per ton, $4 per ton but a price will be governed to some extent by the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.874" offset="19095406">If the market drops we reserve the right to decrease the price, if the market goes up we will give you an interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="4852.005" offset="19407935">Paragon is obliged to pay a royalty which it pays to the assignor, Mr. Claiborne and he takes that royalty in and reports it as capital gain and to pay in any sub-royalties, offset in royalties that he has to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.291" offset="19473136">The division and the regulation is that if Paragon sells it for 6 1/2 a ton and the royalty comes out, that's its rule 625 and it pays us $4 a ton, then the parties themselves have made the apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.283" offset="19545130">We get it on $4 a ton and they get it on $2.25 cents a ton, that's the way these statute works.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.204" offset="19572715">If you once grant the proposition that the mine operators are entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.697" offset="19622766">I think I had some other points here but Mr. Heymann has conceded that the operators were interested in what Paragon was realizing for their coal, rightfully so because if Paragon did well then under their agreement, if their market price went up they could get it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.314" offset="19705208">He quoted certain testimony from one of the witnesses which would happen to be witness of Paragon who had some obligation to Paragon where he said that he didn't care about the price or the price didn't mean anything to him but I think the record is clear upon analysis and as I pointed out in my brief that they were definitely interested in the market price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.044" offset="19800085">Well, that's the only industry in the Buchanan County of any cost or these if a dock changes its price at 8 o'clock in the morning everybody up the lunch stop knows about it by 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.670" offset="19862674">Now the Tax Court didn't make a finding that the price was apparently changeable at the will of Paragon.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.687" offset="19894648">It said that the price did fluctuate based on overextended periods based on market conditions and then at the conclusion and to some extent on labor cost then in its opinion towards the conclusion it says that this amount that Paragon paid was apparently changeable at the will of the Paragon suggesting that the Tax Court itself was very certain about it but I think what it refers to is this that Paragon being the party that receive the coal and marketed, it always initiated the price changes and since all of the price changes which it initiated were in accordance with the market, there was no occasion for the operators to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="5026.407" offset="20105613">I just want to move on to one other point and then I think I'm nearing the conclusion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5032.605" offset="20130377">There's been some testimony here that the fact that these individuals were not given a specific area to mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.264" offset="20164963">The Tax Court was a little wishy washy on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5044.497" offset="20177920">It didn't bother the court below any but upon the record, you can examine the testimony of the operators and you'll find that they testified that they were assigned a specific area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.800" offset="20231105">Now, the testimony of the -- I mean the only testimony on the contrary is the engineer who was in charge of the operation and who the operators have to pay for all inside engineering work.</text>
            <text syncTime="5074.778" offset="20299024">Now, he at the beginning of his testimony jumped all over the place as to whether there was or wasn't an error, but on three occasions towards the end of his testimony, he was pinned down on his question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5088.413" offset="20353567">Once by counsel for the mine operators, twice by the Tax Court and these appear at records 78 through 83 and he conceded that no change that he had ever made caused any operator to lose coal that was always a question of adding coal, that all of it -- that at no time did he make a change on the operator's projections of maps which cost any operator operating at that time to lose any coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.482" offset="20493897">It was always to add coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5125.266" offset="20501002">What would happen is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.967" offset="20515840">They drive in the mine and Operator A let's take the Merritt's, they would operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="5134.801" offset="20539141">Operator B would go broke or quit or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="5139.041" offset="20556069">After he had stopped operating then Merritt's would make a deal to mind some coal otherwise it would have been mined by Operator B and a new allocation would be made or Paragon would acquire additional leases then they would come to the operator and ascertain whether he wanted to take on the burden of mining an additional amount of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5159.616" offset="20638407">So there is no case when any coal was ever taken away from an operator who was operating at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.957" offset="20703817">If the Commissioner desires a workable rule in this case in this whole situation, I submit he's got one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5183.601" offset="20734328">He submit -- he issued a GCM in 1950.2629 is the number of it, which spells out the rules with reference of the strip mine and I submit our case comes within.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.307" offset="20793156">I won't go into it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5199.724" offset="20798798">I submit that he would -- if he would update that a little, he hasn't revoked it since Parsons v.Smith bring in the principles of Parsons v. Smith either have not only a workable rule but an equitable rule and if it's going to be workable, it has got to be placed on the economic realities of the situation rather than some fine legal distinction as to whether they own the coal, whether they have legal title to it because taxation is a practical matter and it is the burdens that you place on people that should give rise to the deductions in the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.807" offset="20947174">We go in here our people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5238.974" offset="20955847">We make this investment and when we don't make it -- when we don't make it, then there's no income to pay but when we do make it we think we're entitled to, we're obligated to pay our tax and also entitled to any benefits that true to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.798" offset="21023138">I particularly dislike the Commissioner's argument in this case because it's based primarily on speculation as to what might have happened or what could have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.072" offset="21068278">He says that they have no rights, that Paragon could just pay them for services and if they came down to a question of bargaining power -- this is the little man and this is the big man.</text>
            <text syncTime="5278.968" offset="21115820">Well, I'll close by saying this that our position of this argument has been known to Paragon since 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.428" offset="21157616">At that time the Stillwell case was being litigated and it was decided favorably to the coal mine operators by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="5297.489" offset="21189904">He has known since then our position with respect to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5302.775" offset="21211011">He has never attempted to clarify our contract, never attempted to renegotiate it and never even threatened the prices out of our contract by reducing the level to a price at which we couldn't operate or any of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.437" offset="21277675">On the contrary, he has taken the benefits of the agreement and knowing that we had a certain understanding with respect thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="5330.860" offset="21323337">This has been onerous litigation for my people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5334.520" offset="21338070">They're not wealthy people and the amounts aren't big and if this whole question if they have the right determination they could have been decided for a fraction of the expanse that has been spent in this tax litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5346.033" offset="21384046">All Paragon has to do is bring action of ejectment in Buchanan County, Virginia then we would find out directly and quickly whether they could terminate or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="5798.684" offset="23194645">Sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="5800.799" offset="23203109">These are development expenses which I have incurred in connection with bringing a mine to a development stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5808.557" offset="23234142">I might also add how much coal is there farmed in a mine at this particular time and how these were a value to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5817.652" offset="23270504">So in conclusion, I'd like to state that if you go back to the basic statute, it's says that the language of this statute, this is Palmer versus Bender.</text>
            <text syncTime="5827.844" offset="23311360">It's broad enough to provide at least for every case in which the taxpayers acquired by investment, any interest in the coal in place and secures by any form of legal relationship income derived from the extraction of the mineral to which it must look for the return of its capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="5852.496" offset="23409894">If the statute is broad enough to provide for middlemen, who can buy the rights and transfer them to others as in the various oil cases which this case is beside it, it certainly broad enough to provide for the mine operators on the basis of the obligations which they assumed and performed in this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="5884.441" offset="23537685">Mr. Wiener.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frederick_bernays_wiener" startTime="5884.568" stopTime="6136.376">
            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="5884.568" offset="23538207">The Commissioner has very kindly yielded his remaining time to me but since the totality is only six minutes, I won't be detaining Your Honors very long unlike them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5899.931" offset="23599647">I don't think the Court is going to be assisted in determining this case by consideration of whether the competing taxpayers are rich or poor or by dealing with equality of bargaining power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5914.377" offset="23657430">We're dealing here with a statute and the only way we can construe that statute properly is to look at its language to avoid fictions, to avoid semantics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5925.947" offset="23703719">Now, we have a statute and its interpretations here notably Parsons against Smith say that the deduction for depletion follows ownership or capital interest or capital investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5939.870" offset="23759412">It doesn't make any difference what.</text>
            <text syncTime="5941.807" offset="23767144">It is if you please a capitalist statute that makes no difference but it might be a better statute in some points of view if it were different.</text>
            <text syncTime="5953.286" offset="23813120">Now, the size of the investment made is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5958.626" offset="23834436">In the Parsons' case there was Parsons.His investment in machinery was $200,000, costs had $500,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="5969.309" offset="23877172">Now, every investment that the contractors here have made is deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5975.011" offset="23899951">The current expenses are deductible under Section 162.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.060" offset="23916147">The capital expenses are deductible under 167 and their development expenses are deductible under 616.</text>
            <text syncTime="5986.630" offset="23946449">The only thing they can't deduct for is coal but as Mr. Merrell revealed in answering the questions by Mr. Justice White, they didn't capitalize their development expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="6000.229" offset="24000888">They expensed in the jargon of the tax technician, they expensed every penny they spent except the investment in machinery, that's the only thing they capitalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="6011.292" offset="24045087">And it doesn't do any -- it doesn't very helpful I think to talk about selling coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6018.152" offset="24072568">You sell only what you own.</text>
            <text syncTime="6020.933" offset="24083644">These contractors didn't sell Paragon its own coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6026.417" offset="24105587">They couldn't take it elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="6027.778" offset="24111020">They couldn't give it to anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="6029.328" offset="24117290">They couldn't take it on the market to see whether possibly they could make a better bargain with someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="6035.191" offset="24140696">It was Paragons' coal they were paid for mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.178" offset="24152712">Now, everyone of the seven factors here with a possible exception of terminability on which Your Honors rested in Parsons v. Smith is here, and the one factor which the Court in Parsons pointed to as determinative.</text>
            <text syncTime="6055.183" offset="24220630">The one factor that dispelled the fiction of Parsons and Huss tried to persuade Your Honors to it adopt was that there had never been any surrender, any transfer, any conveyance of the capital interest in the coal in the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="6072.556" offset="24290220">Now, the court below disregarded the statute, disregarded the regulations rough shot over the findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6081.435" offset="24325642">Used -- relied on authorities that were patently not in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6085.504" offset="24341943">Relied on the same kind of semantiticized fiction that Parsons v. Smith rejected and reverted to the pre-Parsons decisions which it had on the basis of which Parsons was brought here under a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="6102.473" offset="24409861">The court below simply ignored Parsons against Smith, maybe that to paraphrase Alexander Pope only very slightly, a court convinced against its will is also of the same opinion still but if you read Paragon -- Parsons v. Smith objectively and look at the findings actually found here, then I think Your Honors will agree with the Commissioner and with the petitioner Paragon where there must be a reversal.</text>
