            <label>Mr. J. R. Goldthwaite, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="14.251" offset="56947">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors, in response to Mr. Justice Harlan's question with respect to the finality of the judgment in this case, I pointed out in my argument yesterday Mr. Justice Harlan that this case was tried at final trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.720" offset="122880">The only thing which remained to be done after it was sent back to the trial court was the assessment of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.075" offset="152242">All other issues had been disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.600" offset="170318">We urged a federal preemption in putting all of the evidence which was available on federal preemption so far as that federal question which is the only federal question in the case, the question of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.070" offset="244193">The judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama was final and under the rule of this Court and Common Laborers against Curry in which Your Honor concurred especially this Court determined that where the question of federal jurisdiction was the only federal question in the case that that could be brought up prior to the final disposition of the case in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.049" offset="356101">Now, the case is on appeal and is presently pending on the assessment of damages on some $3000 in the Supreme Court of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.650" offset="394553">It cannot be tried before or be argued there and submitted for decision before sometime next month.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.822" offset="431229">Under the decisions of this Court both in injunction cases and in damage suits -- so where federal or jurisdiction attaches to the case, state courts are controlled by the federal law, they -- the -- in the Borden case in Texas the Court held that the state court could not award damages because the subject matter was preempted and was within the competence of the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.414" offset="557558">All of those factors are present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.264" offset="569051">A determination of the jurisdictional question will conclude all federal questions in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.144" offset="612519">Additionally, there are some old decisions of this Court to the effect that where the only judicial act which remains is the assessment of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.920" offset="667585">The Court will go on and review the legal issues prior to the determination of that semi administrative judicial act.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.848" offset="711367">But in any event, the Curry case I think is determinative of the issue of concern which you asked and I don't think in this case is any occasion to -- for any cause for concern that the Curry case will cause problems or to review that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.678" offset="794645">As I mentioned yesterday, the Congress in 1959 amended this statute to provide the state courts could take jurisdiction when the Labor Board had by rule of decision or by published rule declined to assert jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.578" offset="878237">Now, we pointed out to the Alabama Court and proved that there are cases of the Labor Board which under the facts of this case would dictate that the Labor Board affirmatively has jurisdiction over this cause and controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.041" offset="956082">There are some older cases of the Labor Board which were relied upon by the respondent before the Alabama Court which were decided prior to 1958 which hold that there must be interchange of employees between corporations and common working conditions that is the same terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.667" offset="1078648">However, the Labor Board abandoned those cases and that approach to the integrated operational theory in 1958 before Congress amended the statute and in any event the statute specifies that the Labor Board may enlarge the area which in its discretion it asserts jurisdiction, may -- it may not narrow it at the time of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.139" offset="1220545">The rule was that the Labor Board would assert jurisdiction and it still has a rule to more recent decisions do not require interchange of employees or common working conditions so long as there is an actual exercise of control by the common ownership and management and there is no question about that on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.651" offset="1326602">The two owners control every material decision and act in matter of policy of the chain of radio stations which they call the whole Broadcast Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.901" offset="1391595">Now, where it is shown that the Labor Board has issued decisions to the effect that it will assert jurisdiction of the controversy, we believe that the decisions of this Court did take that the state court should yield to the competence of the Labor Board and allow the Labor Board to decide whether or not it will assert jurisdiction of the particular controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.453" offset="1549793">I point out that the statute says that the Board may establish its rules, jurisdictional rules, the discretionary jurisdictional rules as it respects the volume of commerce by rule of decision or by published rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.779" offset="1623040">The Congressional history while we did not feel that it was necessary because the statute is palpably clear as to what its intendment is.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.947" offset="1667762">The congressional history indicates that some of the Congressmen, at least Mr. Thompson I believe of New Jersey, who spoke at length on several occasions and others spoke of a case by case approach on the part of the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.929" offset="1751667">Which would indicate that the term rule of decision contemplates that unless it was palpably certain on the basis of previous jurisdictional expressions of the Board that the Board would approach the question of this jurisdiction on a case by case basis wherever necessary and that if there was any doubt as to the question of the Board's jurisdiction the state court should yield and let the Board decide the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.784" offset="1887086">In furtherance of the statute, the Board in 1959 adopted rules by which it will render advisory opinions and the rule specifically provide that either party to a case or a court may apply to the Board Foreign Advisory opinion as it respects its jurisdiction in any case of controversy pending in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.925" offset="1975693">So that they'll -- are means whereby the state court without dismissing the case could direct that a determination of the Labor Board be procured as to the extent of his jurisdiction with respect to the particular facts and issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.556" offset="2050194">And I would like to point out --</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="514.078" offset="2056255">Is there any affirmation by the Board?</text>

            <text syncTime="517.914" offset="2071615">Not in this case Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.966" offset="2083840">It seemed to us that it was quite clear that the Board's rules applied and covered the factual situation and we did not feel that it was necessary and that they -- neither the Court nor the respondent made any effort or undertook to get the Board to make the ruling in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.866" offset="2179448">Here it is arguable, it's more than arguable, it's clear it seems to us that the Board does have jurisdiction and would assert jurisdiction and that therefore the state court should yield as respects to jurisdictional issue I would like to point out that this case is representative of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.961" offset="2271817">The Court mentions that in labor cases the injunction is likely to terminated the dispute and be determinative of the rights of the parties without any effective right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.202" offset="2320718">In this case and in companion cases where injunctions have issued we argued this case, it was not argued but it was submitted to the Supreme Court of Alabama in the fall of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.853" offset="2379337">We argued a companion case before this case was submitted in which an injunction is outstanding in the Supreme Court of Alabama still has not issued a decision in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.126" offset="2424477">Meanwhile, the federal rights of those people have been completely subjugated to the Alabama dictate of the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.539" offset="2458122">Thank you sirs.</text>

            <label>Mr. Willis C. Darby, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="623.519" offset="2494067">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.214" offset="2508800">The question that the Alabama Supreme Court actually decided which to me was a question of pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.715" offset="2542759">The Alabama Supreme Court in substance held that the petitioner here had not properly pleaded the necessary facts or even conclusions for that matter for the Alabama Supreme Court to open Pandora's box if we might call it that and look into the decisions of the Labor Board in order to determine whether or not the Labor Board decisions properly applied by the Alabama Courts to determine their own jurisdiction would have held that this particular employer was a single employer or whether or not it -- and other employers that were so related would be considered for one, for jurisdictional purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.280" offset="2725094">In connection with that in the pleadings and we think that's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.830" offset="2747246">On page 6 of the record, paragraph 2 of the plead to the jurisdiction of the Court actually foreclosed in the Alabama Courts the issue of whether or not the plaintiff was an employer alone within the jurisdiction or whether or not the plaintiff in other companies that had a similar stock ownership was the employer because in the plead to the jurisdiction the petitioner here admits the complainant's Broadcast Service of Mobile is an employer within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.988" offset="2895935">Now, had they wanted to prove to the Court or properly raise the issue in the Alabama Court, they should have plead that the respondent there and the petitioner here was not an employer within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act that the real employer was by corporation, what they have urged all the way through.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.199" offset="3004709">But there at the very outset of the pleading we find that they admit that Broadcast Service of Mobile was an employer within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.883" offset="3051520">Then it follows very clearly from the evidence presented the Broadcast Service of Mobile did not do $100,000 worth of business a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.447" offset="3089763">That's not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.255" offset="3096973">They were doing about 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.401" offset="3105541">There'd only been in existence for a very few months -- oh, actually for a very few weeks when the injunction was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.226" offset="3128842">But there you have a question of pleading.</text>

            <text syncTime="817.552" offset="3270113">They amended it.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.878" offset="3270008">They didn't eliminate the paragraph two that we have referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.523" offset="3269904">They added more to it and perhaps the Alabama Courts are a little improper in the way that they don't look as they do in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.228" offset="3269799">We have strict pleading in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.876" offset="3269695">I don't personally like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.123" offset="3269590">A lot of the lawyers there don't like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.548" offset="3269486">You can get yourself into a lot of trouble by the strict pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.517" offset="3278054">They perhaps tried and perhaps this Court would consider that they made a effort that was strong enough, but we would submit this, that if this Court made the determination that they made a strong enough effort and that the laws of the United States in applying would also cover the laws of pleading then the Alabama Supreme Court should certainly have an opportunity to perform its function in the federal system and that is for it to pass upon the evidence that was presented below.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.666" offset="3398635">They get to apply in the first instance the rules of the National Labor Relations Board and then if it makes a mistake in such application then it would be proper perhaps for this Court to review it.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.442" offset="3441685">But the question being reviewed at that time would be whether or not the Alabama Supreme Court properly waived the evidence in the court below and whether or not the Alabama Supreme Court properly applied to the Labor Board and we submit the decisions of the Courts of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.085" offset="3512320">Now we have two sets of decisions that --</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.313" offset="5749238">Oh, that would not have changed our argument Mr. Justice Black because we would say that the state court in the first instance had a right and the duty to determine whether or not the federal statute or the federal law was applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.434" offset="5813708">What we have here is a effort by the Congress to eliminate the no man's land that was created and Congress had said that where the Labor Board declines to assert jurisdiction nothing in the Act in substance will prevent the state court from asserting jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.905" offset="5875566">Well, the way the Act itself is written it is obvious that Congress didn't intend to send the case first to the Labor Board but it intended as the way it's written for the state court to consider the applicable federal law and to make the initial determination of whether or not the Labor Board had declined to assert jurisdiction of the particular type of case that was there before the Board, there before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.447" offset="5973786">And we think that the state court would always be required under any such law to determine its own jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.950" offset="5999700">Of course in doing that it would have to apply federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1518.604" offset="6074410">We do not think that because we do not think that the arguable task of this Court applies to a case under 14 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.905" offset="6111608">And the reason for that is that if you leave the arguable test in, you had -- still have a no man's land because whenever you get a closed case the state court deny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.994" offset="6159882">Whether the Labor Board will or will not act would take a long period of time as the parties are not going to know what the law is during that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.582" offset="6190289">We think that if the case is arguable the argument must be made to the state court and the state court applying the federal decisions of the Federal Courts of Appeals or this Court and of the National Labor Relations Board would make the determination of whether it had jurisdiction to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.794" offset="6263118">And then after it had made a final determination of course if it made a mistake it could have been appealed to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.006" offset="6284016">You have the -- you may even have the situation where the courts would differ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.289" offset="6301153">You have been (Inaudible) of a case below where the National Labor Relations Board considered the labor dispute that they held there was no violation of Section 8 (b) (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.217" offset="6340859">Along came a jury trial (Inaudible) -- both cases were appealed to the same Circuit Court and the jury disagreed with the Labor Board and they awarded substantial damages to the employer but you had two different fact finding agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.457" offset="6397806">In here the Act specifically says that nothing in the Act shall prevent the state court from asserting jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.197" offset="6424764">We think that is another confusion that we have here is that -- or the words that are used in the statute had said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.797" offset="6455171">The statute says (Inaudible) -- refers to a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.164" offset="6472620">The Solicitor General Cox had said in an article that he wrote while he was a professor at Harvard Law School, the question is probably made more difficult by the fact of a bad choice of words on the part of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.654" offset="6530612">The Congress used labor dispute or perhaps what they should have used was unfair labor practice proceeding or a representation proceeding and that explains the case that much puzzled us involved here, the Jemcon Broadcasting Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.069" offset="6588186">There a petition was filed with the National Labor Relations Board concerning a radio station in Mobile, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.181" offset="6620682">The National Labor Relations Board said they didn't do a $100,000 worth of business so they dismissed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.134" offset="6644506">So the union put up a picket line and the company went in and obtained the state court injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.531" offset="6662060">It didn't look like you could be much clearer because we had the decision of the National Labor Relations Board saying they would not exert jurisdiction over the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.514" offset="6698005">Then they asked for one of these advisory opinions and of course had the petition, they didn't want to do the advisory opinion they could have asked for it from the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.847" offset="6731337">They asked one advisory opinion and the Labor Board comes along and says, "We will assert jurisdiction because they wrote to some advertiser, the Delchamps which was an advertising company and they would have asserted jurisdiction over Delchamps".</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.639" offset="6786508">So what happens next?</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.738" offset="6794867">A union who had come here and organized the employees spent in this labor dispute filed a petition with the Board and they say, "We'll hold an election for us".</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.355" offset="6833319">Then the Board had said it will assert jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.404" offset="6845544">What did they say when they filed that petition, it the Board itself that said, they said, "We will never assert jurisdiction because there's not a $100,000 worth of business involved", and they cited their own advisory opinion which showed that the Board evidently applies the same criteria that the question of a labor dispute -- they don't look at it as a labor dispute they look at it as a question of whether or not it's a representation question or whether or not it's an unfair labor practice question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.268" offset="6964976">Frankly it looks hard to understand what the Board had done in that particular case because it did appeal very inconsistent but once you -- if you use Professor Cox's definition of what labor dispute means in the Act you'd come out with something that at least you can understand what the volatility that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.386" offset="7041463">With the respect to the question of jurisdiction here, this case is quite different from the construction in General Labor Union case for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.303" offset="7077198">We don't think that anyone before this Court including the United States doubts that the Supreme Court of Alabama had a right to determine its own jurisdiction under Section 14 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.449" offset="7125786">In the construction in General Labor Union case the Court was particularly careful to point out that the issue for review there did not pass upon the question of whether the Court had erroneously performed its function and under the federal law the only question there was whether the Court had any power whatsoever to make the determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.153" offset="7216588">Under 14 (c) here the state court had the power and the duty to make the determination, the question of whether it correctly made it and therefore we would submit the General Labor Union would not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.096" offset="7264340">And that what would apply would be the general rule that this Court will not take a piecemeal appeal or -- and the case is not properly here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2280.367" offset="9121437">We further submit that if this Court determines to consider the merits of the action and that is to analyze the evidence in the record to make an initial determination on what that evidence meant and in that event on the cases that we have cited and we've referred to quite a number of them in many recent cases involving dissent from members of the National Labor Relations Board and the dissents at least say that so far as the Board is concerned the Board still looks to determine whether or not there has been interchange of employees at the same working conditions in the various places something that everyone admits is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.203" offset="9260722">The trial court found that the day to day operations were controlled completely by the manager of the radio station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.824" offset="9295203">Anyone that owns a small business is going looking on it every now and then no matter who he has for the manager to see that its running right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.788" offset="9323102">And if he is not the type of man that will speak to the employees then it would be most unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.747" offset="9342955">But the day to day operations, the operations relied on by the Courts of Appeal and by the Labor Board in most of their cases is admittedly run by the manager of the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.342" offset="9389349">And the stations do not have any interrelationship in any form whatsoever that the Board has relied upon and we submit that if the Court considered the facts of the case that on the basis of the facts properly applied that the Labor Board would not have asserted jurisdiction and this employer belongs to one of that class wherein the states were free to act and apply state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.322" offset="9481195">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2375.753" offset="9502929">With respect to this matter of pleading as I construe the Alabama decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.072" offset="9532186">What they were saying was that the only rule they would rely upon was the $100,000 single employer rule and that any other rule whether it was pled or not wouldn't satisfy them and says we didn't plead that rule that was the only thing they were willing to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.595" offset="9602299">And therefore they said that will -- not only the pleading but the evidence fails to exclude Alabama jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.459" offset="9633750">But of course when you get into the integrated operation, evidence and the pleadings we fully raise the federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.993" offset="9671889">In that connection I'd like to call the attention of the Court to a case which is not mentioned in our brief which is the case of Rose Staub against the City of Baxley in which the Georgia Court ruled that the constitutional question was not properly raised and would not consider the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.204" offset="9764780">This Court granted certiorari and said well maybe if one raised properly in Georgia but it's a federal constitution in spite of this Court, the question is sufficiently raised and this Court did consider the constitutional question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2472.169" offset="9888601">Mr. Justice Harlan, in further response to your question about us supplying for an advisory opinion I'd like to call the attention of the Court to the fact that in the petition for certiorari we cite these other companion cases which are still pending in Alabama Courts in which injunctions are outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.765" offset="9978984">In the case which is now in the Alabama Supreme Court we applied for an advisory opinion and gotten the advisory opinion from the Labor Board stating that the Labor Board affirmatively would assert jurisdiction in a set of facts substantially identical to the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.218" offset="10056829">We pled in that case the Labor Board's decision attached it to our plea to the jurisdiction.And the Alabama Court totally ignored the Labor Board's advisory opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.812" offset="10115239">They said, "Well, the Labor Board is not going to advise us in effect".</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.419" offset="10137600">And just -- in spite of the advisory opinion they issued the injunction and that injunction is still in effect and has been in effect over two years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2560.523" offset="10242090">Yes sir, I think it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.944" offset="10247732">But I think the proper rule is on the Section 14 (c) that if it is palpably clear that this Labor Board under existing rules of decision or publish rules, the rules of decision are all we have would not assert jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.804" offset="10327144">The state courts have the authority to so determine and to assert jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.665" offset="10350655">On the other hand, if it's palpably clear that the Labor Board would assert jurisdiction the state court would be obligated as a matter of law to so find but in any situation where it is arguable that the Labor Board would assert jurisdiction on the basis of reasonable judicial argument then I think it's incumbent on the state court as this Court said in the Garmon case to yield to the primary competence of the Board and let the Board have an opportunity to rule on a case to case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.262" offset="10492970">I don't think the Court ought to abdicate its judicial responsibility as the Wisconsin Court in the Harron (ph) case almost did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.291" offset="10533094">That's now pending on a petition for certiorari here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.485" offset="10545842">But I think where it's arguable that the Labor Board does have jurisdiction then the Court should yield to the primary competence of the Board.</text>
