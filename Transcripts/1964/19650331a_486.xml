            <label>Mr. Frank I. Goodman</label>
            <text syncTime="8.736" offset="34900">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.884" offset="47438">When we broke off yesterday, I had just offered an analogy which in our view aptly illustrates the basic principle of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.699" offset="82756">I suggested that if A lends B $100 today, in return for B's promise to repay the $100 plus $6 extra one year from today, B's obligation could be expressed in the note in a number of different ways, all of which mean exactly the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.112" offset="164362">The note could say $100 plus 6% interest or $100 plus 6% or $100 plus $6 or as in the present case, the note could simply say $106.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.072" offset="220264">In each of these cases, the $6 increment simply represents the compensation which the borrower agrees to pay the lender in return for the lender's money, in short, interest as this Court has defined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.382" offset="277525">Everyone agrees that in the case of the note with 6% stated interest an accrual basis taxpayer would be required to accrue the $6 increment over the life of the note and we say exactly the same result should obtain in the case of $106 note issued at a $6 discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.019" offset="355997">A cash basis taxpayer of course would not be required to account for the gain until he sold or redeemed the note.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.572" offset="386194">At that time, he would be deemed to be selling two things; first, the note itself carrying with it the right to interest accruing in the future, and secondly, the right to the interest that had already been earned up to the date of the sale or redemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.401" offset="449515">Part of the purchase price would have to be allocated to the note and the rest of it would have to be allocated to the interest component and that part allocated to the interest component would be taxable as ordinary income.</text>

            <text syncTime="140.515" offset="562051">Well, if -- let's suppose first that nothing happens and he sells the note at the end of six months for $103.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank I. Goodman</label>
            <text syncTime="147.970" offset="591830">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.302" offset="593189">In that case, there would be no capital gain or loss and there would be interest income of $3.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.963" offset="611788">If the market rate of interest increased we'll say, so that he was able to sell the note only for $102, the result in that case roughly speaking, not quite exactly, but roughly speaking, would be a $1 capital loss and $3 of interest income.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.528" offset="686080">It wouldn't be exactly that because the $102 would have to be -- well 100, one hundred and thirds of that would have to be allocated to the note and three one hundred and thirds to the interest element and would come out that he had perhaps received about $2.97 of interest and slightly less than $100 would be attributable to the note in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.045" offset="896104">Well I think for the most part Mr. Justice Goldberg, the 1954 statute was intended primarily as a legislative overruling of the Caulkins case.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.046" offset="1004147">I don't think they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.373" offset="1021492">The taxpayer concedes all of this in the case of the note with stated interest and we say that exactly the same principle should apply in the case of the discounted note.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.063" offset="1060153">This conclusion is compelled not only by reason, it is supported also by the overwhelming weight of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.853" offset="1087321">Since 1959, the basic issue involved in this case has come before six Courts of Appeals, the Court of Claims and the Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.362" offset="1121384">Only one court, the Sixth Circuit in the Midland-Ross case has resolved the matter in favor of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.500" offset="1149910">All of the others, the First, Second, Third, Fifth and Ninth Circuits have recognized that original issue discount is exactly the same thing as interest and should be taxed as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.769" offset="1199020">The conclusion is further supported by the long-standing rule as to the treatment of original issue discount from the standpoint of the borrower, that is to say, the corporation which issues the security.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.508" offset="1241966">The decisions of this and other courts have uniformly held that this -- that the excess of the amount which the borrower agrees to pay upon maturity over the amount at which the security is issued, represents a cost of obtaining the lender's money and as such must be amortized over the life of the note and deductible from ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.507" offset="1334021">It is true that at least one Court of Appeals, the Second Circuit has thought it more appropriate to regard this deductible item as a cost sustained by the issuing corporation rather than its interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.102" offset="1384385">The Ninth Circuit has regarded it alternatively, either as interest or as a cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.070" offset="1408209">But three other Courts of Appeals, the Third, the Fourth and the D.C. Circuit have concluded unequivocally that original issue discount is deductible as an interest expense by the issuing corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.817" offset="1459200">At page 15 of our brief in the Midland-Ross case, we cite the well-reasoned opinions of Judge Goodrich for the Third Circuit and Judge Parker for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.798" offset="1503190">We neglected to cite the third case which is Helvering versus California-Oregon Power Company, 75 F.2d 64, the decision of the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="427.036" offset="1708095">In regard to the question that you just asked, in view of the contention by Midland-Ross that the government has taken a different view with regard to the status of original issue of discount to the borrower, Midland-Ross says that the government regards this as a loss rather than as interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.142" offset="1788552">It's true that the government has been inconsistent about this over the course of the years and at times has regarded it as a loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.081" offset="1812271">But so far as I know, the most recent expression is contained in the ruling which we quote on page 36 of the Midland-Ross brief which says -- states as follows, the final paragraph from the footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.208" offset="1872771">The courts have considered the nature of discount in cases involving private corporations and have held it to be in the nature of differed interest which maybe amortized for income tax purposes over the life of the bonds by deducting the annual proportion thereof from the issuing corporations' gross income each year as accrued interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.674" offset="1962632">The leading decision of -- oh, I was going to present one further citation which we didn't give in our brief, and that is to the Longview Hilton Hotel Company case, 9 T.C. 180, 182 and the case is cited therein, which I think expresses the view of most of the cases of the Tax Court to the effect that it is an interest deduction to the borrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.804" offset="2059180">The leading decision of this Court, Helvering versus Union Pacific Company is a little bit ambivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.773" offset="2083004">At some point, the Court appears to refer to the original issue of discount item as a loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.382" offset="2117486">But it also states that discount is a factor “in arriving at the actual amount of interest paid for the use of capital procured by a bond issue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="538.977" offset="2155833">The difference between the capital realized by the issuer and par value which is to be paid at maturity, must be added to the aggregate coupon payments in order to arrive at the total interest paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.739" offset="2202854">Now if as these authorities seem to indicate, original issue discount represents interest paid or accrued by the borrower, then necessarily it represents income, it represents interest received or accrued by the lender.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.870" offset="2263458">Petitioners don't really dispute the fact that original issue discount and stated interest are in substance one and the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.147" offset="2292506">They argue however, that the government is estopped to deny them capital gains treatment because of its earlier acquiescence in the Sixth Circuit's decision in the Caulkins case.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.019" offset="2363977">Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, I agree with the petitioners that premium logically should be treated the same way as discount and vice versa and also that prior to 1942, I think it was the general understanding that premium was not to be regarded as an item which ended into the computation of interest but rather as a capital item to use that terminology.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.704" offset="2462720">However, the two questions have historically been treated as separate compartments, altogether apart from one another at least much of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.842" offset="2491350">In 1942, Congress enacted a statute dealing expressly with the problem of bond premium and said not a word about bond discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.777" offset="2527086">In 1954, it enacted a statute dealing with original issue discount and said not a word about premium and in some respects, the two statutory solutions are not parallel.</text>

            <text syncTime="789.113" offset="3156428">And my answer was that the earliest case on this so far as I know is the Fischer case decided in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.893" offset="3187566">Since then, there had been a number of cases which have confirmed the result that you must allocate the purchase price between the interest and principal component.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.744" offset="3226958">Prior to that time, there was no specific case and I think that the matter was inconsiderable, valid and confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.323" offset="3253290">That was not the result of any statutory change in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.260" offset="3289025">I was answering Mr. Justice Stewart's question about premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.978" offset="3311909">Not only has Congress treated premium and discount differently, but this Court has also tended to regard them as separate questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.180" offset="3344718">In 1932, a much criticized decision, the Old Colony case, this Court held in effect that premium was not to be taken into account in computing the interest deductions for the issuer.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.427" offset="3409607">The Court said that interest meant what everybody -- interest meant what is called interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.828" offset="3431236">It meant the nominal interest rate and it didn't have anything to do with what the Court called the esoteric notion of effective interest dreamed up by accountants.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.810" offset="3467180">Two years later though in 1936 in the Union Pacific case to which I've already referred, the Court said that original issue discount as distinct from premium was to be taken into account in determining the issuer's interest deductions so that it treated premium and interest differently -- premium and discount differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.957" offset="3547742">And as I've already indicated, the lower federal courts have fairly consistently though not entirely consistently treated discount as an interest item to the borrower without so much as nod to the Old Colony case and its ruling as to premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.985" offset="3619840">This disparity of treatment was noted by no less than observer than Roswell Magill who stated at page 184, I think it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.797" offset="3655158">I have that somewhere, stated at page 184 of his well known book on tax -- 204 rather, of his well known book on taxable income that the Union Pacific decision with regard to discount is “hardly reconcilable on theories of accrual accounting with the prior holding as to bond premium.”</text>
            <text syncTime="937.893" offset="3751497">So while I don't pretend to defend a differentiation in treatment between premium and discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.541" offset="3782113">I don't think that the Court need deter from reaching the sound and sensible result in the case of discount merely because of early and long since discredited decisions about premium which in any event were superseded by statute as early as 1942, long before the transactions in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.420" offset="4057652">Now turning to the Caulkins' decision and the contention that the government is estopped by virtue of its acquiescence in that case, we think that, that contention fails for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.558" offset="4098194">The first place, because the government is not bound by its acquiescence and in the second place, because in any event, the Caulkins' decision does not rule this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.568" offset="4134243">It's well settled I think that acquiescence in an erroneous decision does not preclude the government from correcting its mistake and collecting a tax otherwise due.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.960" offset="4175830">The taxpayer cannot claim surprise in this regard because the cumulative bulletin, every cumulative bulletin says on its very front page that the rulings contain therein and that includes acquiescence are not binding but are simply intended as guides to official administrative prudent, administrative thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.480" offset="4253884">The statute expressly gives the Commissioner discretion to determine the extent to which any ruling maybe applied without retroactive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.890" offset="4291500">The taxpayer says that in this case, that abuse -- that discretion was abused because the Commissioner made the withdrawal of his acquiescence retroactive with respect to all taxpayers other than those who had purchase the particular type of security involved in the Caulkins case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.962" offset="4355762">Now we don't say that the differentiation between that type of security and other types of securities was altogether a reasonable one, but on the other hand, it certainly wasn't arbitrary and invidious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.272" offset="4401006">The government simply made a limited vow in the direction of stare decisis much as this Court did when it held that football and boxing were subject to the antitrust laws but refrained from extending that principle to baseball which was the particular sport which had been covered by the prior decision in Tulsan exempting it from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.726" offset="4498808">In any event, the Caulkins case really isn't in point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.592" offset="4514273">The Caulkins arose under a particular statute, Section 117F of the 1939 code which dealt only with the retirement of bonds and the decision was very much based upon the particular language of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.773" offset="4571011">In Caulkins, the taxpayer purchased for about $15,000 payable in ten annual installments, an installment certificate in the face amount of $20,000 which he surrendered for that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.833" offset="4619285">That represented the equivalent of a 5.5% return on his investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.176" offset="4636630">And indeed, the 5.5% was even written on the cover of the certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.262" offset="4657006">The Court held that this was capital gain under the language of Section 117F which provided that amounts received upon the retirement of corporate bonds would be considered to be received in exchange therefore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.333" offset="4709251">The Court didn't base its decision upon any broad, general principle that original issue discount was different from interest or had traditionally been treated differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.432" offset="4745718">In fact, specifically agreed with the government, that the discount was essentially the same as interest and that there was no practical reason for taxing it other than as ordinary income, but it felt compelled by the particular language of Section 117F to hold it capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.883" offset="4811442">I think it's quite probable that the Court would have reached the same result in the case of a note with stated interest and it might well have reached a different result had the discounts been realized upon a transaction not covered by Section 117F, in other words, by a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.816" offset="4887197">Now this interpretation of the Caulkins' decision is by no means a novel one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.439" offset="4905691">Even before the government withdrew its acquiescence in Caulkins, the Tax Court held that the rule of Caulkins was confined to retirements and did not apply to sale and I'd like to read the Court exactly what the Tax Court said in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.108" offset="4972356">It said in the Paine case 23 T.C. 391 and 401, we think it clear that the decision in the Caulkins case was based solely upon the precise language of Section 117F which left no doubt that the entire amount received as a result of the retirement of notes and registered form was to be deemed received in exchange for such notes despite the recognition of both courts, both the Tax Court and the Court of -- and the Sixth Circuit that the increment there under consideration was essentially interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.774" offset="5087086">It is obvious however that Section 117F is not here applicable because there was no retirement of the notes but only a sale and there is no evidence that the notes were in registered form.</text>

            <text syncTime="1668.667" offset="6674599">Mr. Goodman yesterday afternoon in his statement of the facts, inadvertently but yet very peculiarly significant reason, I am afraid misdescribed the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.959" offset="6739801">Mr. Goodman's mistake was that he stated that in the transactions here involved, I beg your pardon, it was an economic loss of consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.097" offset="6784313">The fact is however that there was an economic gain of substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.607" offset="6810331">This was examined by the Treasury Department on audit and they were satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.405" offset="6833528">And that is why the question of whether or not there was an economic gain in this transaction was not raised in either in the lower courts or raised until yesterday -- or stated until yesterday afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.783" offset="6891102">Now the reason why Mr. Goodman made that mistake is that he compared the gain on the sales of the securities made in 1952 with the interest course of carrying the entire position including those securities which were first sold in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.436" offset="6973649">The significance of the mistake is that it emphasizes the difference between an investment including a discount obligation and stated interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.663" offset="7018580">You don't know the results on an investment until the investment is fully disposed of.</text>

            <text syncTime="1925.052" offset="7700167">There the Court pointed out that only on disposition could it be known whether or not a security issued at a premium would produce profit or loss and that is why the lender was not to be permitted to amortize his premium course as against his income currently and I should like to take the liberty of reading the words of the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1982.258" offset="7928999">For some reason, Congress has not done that but by the same token, the privilege of amortizing premium is not allowed with regard to obligations issued by individuals.</text>
