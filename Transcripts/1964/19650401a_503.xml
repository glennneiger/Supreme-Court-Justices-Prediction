            <text syncTime="18.699" offset="74710">This case involves the applicability of the federal estate tax to the proceeds of airplane flight insurance paid on the death of one who has died in an airplane accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.854" offset="123402">The facts are undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.483" offset="133851">On the evening of June 19, 1956 the decedent and his wife went to Idlewild Airport from which he was taking a trip to Venezuela.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.843" offset="179304">In that airport he applied for two flight insurance policies in face amount of $62,500 each, totaling a $125,000 for a premium of $2.50 each.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.333" offset="249313">He signed a written application to each of the two companies and in that application he named his wife Ruth as the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.885" offset="287451">He specified that his trip was to be a roundtrip between New York and Puerto Ordaz in Venezuela.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.755" offset="319007">He gave application, his application to the clerk, who validated them and on instructions of the decedent handed them to the wife who kept them until they will later surrendered for payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.571" offset="370207">There is perhaps some disagreement in this record as to who paid the premium for the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.010" offset="403958">While we don't think anything in this case, in its present posture would turn on that, we note that the tax court judge, although we had testimonies from the wife that she had paid the premium, and refused to make that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.456" offset="461740">They expressed some question.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.487" offset="473861">The Third Circuit on the other hand in stating the facts of the case did go ahead and made that finding though without discussing the point.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.815" offset="659226">Each of these policies provided for payments in specified amounts for certain bodily injuries such as loss of limb or sight resulting from accident in the contemplated airplane flight and provided for the payment of the principle sum on loss of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.470" offset="725786">Each policy also reserved the right in the insured to assign the policy and to change beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.413" offset="757551">At 12:31 am approximately just less than three hours after it took off the plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean and everyone on board was killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.320" offset="813244">On due application by his widow under the policy, she received a $125,000 from the two companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.756" offset="846994">These amounts were not included in the estate tax return filed on behalf of the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.835" offset="871340">The commissioner asserted a deficiency and the case proceeded in due course to the tax court which upheld the deficiency, but on the petitioner's appeal to the Third Circuit, Third Circuit reversed the decision for the government and held that these particular policies were not insurance under policies on the life of the decedent as required by Section 2042 (2) of the Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.922" offset="991608">That code section is in relevant portion set forth at page 16 of our brief and virtually all of the discussion in this case will revolve about those words, insurance under policies on the life of the decedent as set forth in page 16 there.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.101" offset="1072379">Our position before this Court is that the Third Circuit was wrong for four reasons and that the decision of the Third Circuit should be reversed and that of the tax court reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.424" offset="1129639">First we would meet the Third Circuit in the terms in which it spoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.305" offset="1149179">It suggested that somehow this language which I've just quoted is not clear and that it's necessary to make considerable construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.309" offset="1189198">We think that the Third Circuit got into that error by equating the quoted phrase insurance under policies on the life of the decedent with life insurance and then find a fact which no one disputes that life insurance is quite different from accident insurance and it would be our view that the statute rather pointedly refrained from using the term life insurance and says rather insurance under policies on the life of the decedent, which it would seem at least as reasonable reading and in our view the better reading to say that this includes all policies under which death is the occasion for payment of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.757" offset="1343007">And we think that this spirit and the spirit that animates the choice of language in the section is picked up in the regulation, which have been with us for 30 or 40 years, which provide that the term insurance refers to life insurance of every description.</text>

            <label>Mr. John B. Jones, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="362.230" offset="1448856">The legislative history is quoted in the opinions below.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.240" offset="1472888">I think it does not focus on the fact that there might be ordinary life insurance policies and accident life insurance policies that would cover on death.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.214" offset="1512803">What it does do and this comes in a little later in the argument, it does give some support to the theory that the Congress was concerned with the possibility of -- at one time there was no tax on life insurance to a named beneficiary and at that time this was put in and they wanted to have a rule which made it clear that insurance payable to a beneficiary other than the estate was part of the estate and that is really all legislative history deals with.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.955" offset="1631817">I don't think either side has cited anything more helpful than that and that this is I believe amply discussed in both briefs.</text>

            <label>Mr. John B. Jones, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="419.247" offset="1676957">Well I think that I've covered the clarity of the language its really all I wanted to say on that and our second reason for doing this is, for taking this position is, it's all very well for us to sit here and look at this one flight policy which is after all is going to last for a very short time, it doesn't have much intrinsic value as a piece of paper, it isn't worth any more than the $5.00 that was paid on it until the fact that the accident which instantly makes it payable in its full amount and there's not going to be a trading market in these policies, it's not the kind of thing which is transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.004" offset="1839961">And if you compare that with ordinary life insurance, it's very easy to see differences in time, differences in nature and if that was all that was involved it wouldn't be too bad to have a different rule for these flight insurance policies on the one hand and the ordinary life on the other, but the difficulty is that, in our view, this is a -- the insurance policies really fill out a spectrum of which this policy would be off to this side, let's say a flight insurance policy would last a very short time and covers a single flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.282" offset="1957094">And maybe the next one over in the line would be an annual policy and some people are covering only airplane accidents and then the next one would be the term insurance which Your Honor mentioned and then their might be renewable term insurance and then there might be ordinary life insurance with double indemnity and then there might be ordinary life insurance without double indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.716" offset="2038805">And our view is that the distinction which was picked by the Third Circuit was to say that ordinary life insurance and that which is within the meaning of the section, is that which ensures against an inevitable event.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.009" offset="2095961">Well you can't make that statement about term insurance, because term insurance insures only against death during a 10 year, 20 or whatever the agreed term is.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.041" offset="2136085">Now this is a form of term insurance, it covers a limited cause of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.055" offset="2160118">It has a 12-month actual limitation in it, but it would be terminated shorter if the roundtrip terminates before that.</text>

            <text syncTime="553.296" offset="2213094">I say this, I don't think anybody has ever, if I may use the phrase, had the nerve to suggest that it was not includable in the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.479" offset="2249874">Until this decision of the Third Circuit I don't know how you would have made the argument and I'm not sure that in the brief, petitioners go away from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.129" offset="2288431">They don't think that they can soundly argue that term insurance ought to be excluded and in fact in this particular case if the record on pages 23 and 24 you will find that this man had an annual airplane accident life insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.242" offset="2364918">I didn't mean to use life insurance, I beg your pardon, but covering his loss of life in an airplane accident and he didn't make any effort to apply this rule to this policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.285" offset="2401071">He agrees that there is something more in that policy that he just -- he couldn't come into court and claim that, that wasn't includable in his estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.031" offset="2440046">And whereas under the rationale of the Third Circuit as adopted as we see it you would have to rule that it wasn't life insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.104" offset="2472333">So my answer is that the regulations here, say life insurance of every description, as far as I know there has never been a contest or even a situation close enough that it was necessary to issue a ruling suggesting that term insurance was includable.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.596" offset="2534296">I think it would be a fair assumption and I'm sure opposing counsel picking up that they feel I'm in error in this finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.279" offset="2557074">It's the first time that no one has suggested that there was any reason for exclude.</text>

            <text syncTime="643.521" offset="2574002">Wasn't there however a different theory advanced for excluding the other accident policy, and that was that the ownership wasn't transferred to the wife, whereas here the theory was that the ownership was?</text>

            <label>Mr. John B. Jones, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="655.851" offset="2623321">Well that raises problems under the alternative argument which is presented in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.442" offset="2645682">It does not under the rationale which the Third Circuit adopted.</text>

            <label>Mr. John B. Jones, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="665.030" offset="2660101">And that at the time this was advanced to Judge Brown he was talking about, well if you say there's any validity to this argument about the nature of insurance wouldn't it necessarily cover this other policy too?</text>
            <text syncTime="677.237" offset="2708898">And so Your Honor's point is well taken, absent an assignment, there might be very good reasons for taxing it but not under the Third Circuit rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.830" offset="2743275">Now, the second reason or the third reason for -- in our view reversing the Third Circuit is that this seems to us to have been a settled area of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.465" offset="2789773">It is true that the decision is one of the Board of Tax Appeals which is not high up in the judicial structure of the country, but it was promulgated in 1929 and as far as we know has not been contested until this case, or successfully contested until this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.218" offset="2860826">We've cited in our brief, page 6 that the degree to which it's been accepted by the three textbook authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.741" offset="2894890">Opposing counsel in their briefs say well, they're not going all out in their endorsement of it, when they refer to it in their treatises perhaps that's true, but I think treatise writers are exact to take issue with unsound decisions as anybody and I think in these same treatises if there are well established decisions with which they are in disagreement, you will find that they do not hesitate to express it.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.252" offset="2996976">And I will think that the fact that this is reported is entitled to some weight, not in any sense conclusive but it adds to the picture which we see here.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.126" offset="3036473">And the same thing maybe said for the Ackerman decision being known to Congress over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.545" offset="3066149">Again respondent here states, well there's no showing that this was ever called to Congress' attention, which we say granted and if this isn't the strongest case for congressional reenactment, but at the same time if there was discontent with the decision I think one could expect that over the course of 30 years, it would have been called to the attention of Congress and fitted into the picture as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.946" offset="3143784">I think it is fair to say that Congress -- the inaction of Congress supports the view which we're now espousing.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.459" offset="3177744">And the last reason which we would advance for the error in the decision of Third Circuit comes about from the interrelationship between the income tax and the estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.570" offset="3230198">There is in Section 101 of the income tax which is printed at page 17 of our brief, just facing the 2042, a provision which excludes from income amounts paid under a life insurance contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.777" offset="3303027">And the regulations under that section have always felt that, that language was strong enough to support exclusion of death benefits under accident insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.046" offset="3344091">It's the phrase under a life insurance contract, is I would think a narrower phrase in the statute to be construed than that phrase policies on the life of the decedent which we have in Section 2042 in front us now.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.915" offset="3399576">And the reason -- the point to be made here is that if the Third Circuit rationale is accepted then the regulations under 101 are wrong and payments under an accident, so called accident insurance, accident life insurance policy should not be excluded from income under 101 and the price of obtaining the exposition from the estate would be to have it included in the income, which in virtually every case would be a much more expensive proposition tax wise.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.865" offset="3523396">We don't urge that and I don't suppose if we lost this case we would even urge it, but it does seem to us to show that Congress had a very clear concept in mind of what life insurance was and that all the pieces in the puzzle fit together until this case came along and it does knock it considerably out of kilter and that the uncertainty should be removed and that the pattern of taxation of insurance on flight accidents should follow the pattern of all other life insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.172" offset="3680653">Now upon brief here the tax payer makes some point about the incidence of ownership and let me say that this is in our view a more troubling and a closer question under the -- on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.511" offset="3750034">That point however, was dealt with unanimously by -- neither the Court below disagreed on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.140" offset="3776470">It seemed to us that Judge Brown was aware of all the arguments, treated them very carefully and was so satisfying to the Third Circuit that they passed over in a sentence with a statement that decedent here clearly did have the incidence of ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.328" offset="3837283">If I just outline the objections and our answers to them I might suggest one of the most important is a suggestion that somehow with the policies in the wife's hands and the insured on the airplane, there wasn't any practical way to exercise the power to change the beneficiary and I would just point out that on that Section 2042 very clearly speaks of power alone or in conjunction with any other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.734" offset="3970926">And since the most that could be set for facts is that it puts it in the joint control of the decedent and his wife, that there would be no reason for allowing a person by their own act to just argue the impossibility of exercise when Congress has gone so far in advance to cover the possibility of being exercisable with some other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.060" offset="4068206">And another very practical possibility and one that has to be contemplated is that man who buys the flight insurance contract at the counter is not in a very effective position to change the beneficiary, he goes from the counter, he gets on the airplane and he's not going to be allowed to use the pilot's radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.400" offset="4137587">There's not, as a practical matter, a great chance of exercising at that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1100.609" offset="4402364">So as Judge Brown points out it goes too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.859" offset="4415425">And we have cases in the power of appointment area which the heard case is an example which points out it isn't the actual likelihood of exercise of the existence of the power which has to be controlling for tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.283" offset="4481045">Some comment is made that this is pure broiler plate, but we note from the record at page 28 that the company involved has considered this problem a little bit more and now makes available forms for assignment which presumably would permit an insured to assign it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.856" offset="4547396">But unfortunately for the decedent here those forms were not available at that time and we think that closer recognition, there is a right which has to be dealt with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.319" offset="4581251">And just lastly on the incidence of ownership we would say that you can't overlook the accidental portion here for loss of limb and sight and eye.</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.000" offset="4971938">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.138" offset="4988552">The coverage under these policies was the payment of benefits prescribed in the policies resulting from injury through accident in connection with an airplane flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.291" offset="5061068">Of course there was an infinitesimal possibility fortunately that any liability, whatever accrued and of course everybody hoped that the contingency, the accident would never occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.287" offset="5133061">Now it is this fact which I will develop which shows that this kind of coverage does not posses the requirements as intended by Congress under the congressional policy which Mr. Chief Justice asked about in the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.282" offset="5237029">This type of policy is not covered by the intent of Congress as expressed in 1918 and is not covered by the intent of Congress which has persisted to this very day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.269" offset="5317068">Prior to 1918, when the estate tax was imposed, there was no inclusion of life insurance policy proceeds except those which came into the estate physically by reason of the fact that the executor in his fiduciary capacity was a beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.472" offset="5421871">Congress had before it the question of tax evasion or avoidance under which wealthy persons could take from their estates large sums of money, put those sums into life insurance and in that way create for their beneficiaries distributions which would escape estate taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.604" offset="5542348">It was this situation which Congress tried to eliminate by enacting the section which said that hereafter, proceeds on life policies will be included if the insured took out the policies and if the proceeds exceed $40,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.830" offset="5655301">The Court will please observe that only way that this intent could be translated to insurance would be in connection with the translation to life insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.161" offset="5720607">And the reason for that is that life insurance is inherently a form of investment or contract which looks toward the future and looks towards the protection of beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.081" offset="5808274">And the reason why that is so is because the insurance carrier, when he enters into a contract, is just as certain to have to pay to the beneficiary or to the estate as the case may be as there is a certainty of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.315" offset="5909211">Of course this is in complete contrast with a flight accident policy where the probability of payment is infinitesimal and almost negligible and as I say, it is fortunate that, that is the situation.</text>
