            <text syncTime="15.308" offset="166724">This case involves title to approximately 620 acres of land located in El Paso County, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.096" offset="201833">At the trial court, both sides moved for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.212" offset="218237">The City of El Paso's motion was granted and the “at motion” of the appellee Simmons was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.531" offset="247599">On appeal, the Fifth Circuit reversed case.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.166" offset="266094">The facts in this particular case may be very briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.651" offset="288037">The appellee Simmons, predecessors in title, purchased these lands involved from the State of Texas in 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.916" offset="329101">The predecessors in title failed to pay interest on the original purchase and the lands were forfeited to the State of Texas in 1947 and reverted to the public domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.205" offset="390228">Simmons acquired title in June of 1952, and in the latter part of July, attempted to reinstate the original purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.433" offset="431188">His tendered reinstatement was refused because of the fact that they had not been received by the Land Commissioner within the five years prescribed by the statute within effect.</text>

            <label>Mr. William J. Mounce</label>
            <text syncTime="100.937" offset="509137">From mean grantees of the original purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.203" offset="538290">In the latter part of 1955, these lands were awarded to the City of El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.791" offset="560651">And in 1956, they were actually patented to the City of El Paso.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.320" offset="582698">And this suit was filed in the latter part of August in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.359" offset="610910">At the time that these lands were purchased from the State of Texas, there was a statute in effect which I believe is 4218 which regulated the one man that the State of Texas might terminate land purchase contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.787" offset="688546">And that statute provides that a land purchase agreement might be reinstated by paying up all back interest providing that no rights of the third parties had intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.809" offset="740686">This particular statute was amended in 1941 to provide that in case that lands were forfeited for the nonpayment of interest that the lands may be reinstated by making payment of all back interest due, and provided that that by it's no third party have intervened and added one proviso that this must be accomplished within five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.681" offset="856148">So the question therefore presented for this Court at this time is whether the application of the statute of 1941 which is Article 5336 impairs the obligation of these original contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.852" offset="948830">It is the position of the City of El Paso that the proviso requiring that the reinstatement that the land purchase agreements be reinstated within the five-year period is merely a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.429" offset="1007135">In other words, it's one of the methods by which the State of Texas enforces its contracts and it's not necessarily an obligation of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.378" offset="1050917">As a matter of fact, in order to determine whether a contract obligation has been impaired, one must first determine what the obligations are in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.172" offset="1098146">And in this respect, we're guided by some cases decided for this Court in 1900, which considering con -- land purchase contracts from the State of Texas substantially the same as the contracts not in consideration held that the obligations of the contract were one, that the purchaser would pay down a certain sum of money and make these payments each year until he'd paid it off and whenever he had paid his money, although required by the contract, then the State of Texas would issue patent that this purely and simply with obligations of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.423" offset="1259165">That the method by which the State of Texas enforced the particular obligations and terminated the contract rights referred merely to the remedy and consequently could be modified from time to time as long as the changes were reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.720" offset="1324366">And we submit that this is precisely what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.373" offset="1342966">The State has merely modified the manner in which it terminates the land purchase contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.411" offset="1371073">And it's not necessarily impaired obligation for the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.901" offset="1393016">We feel that this case is probably squarely or almost squarely in point with that of Aikins versus Kingsbury which is decided by this Court in the 1920s.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.955" offset="1449232">That involved a California Land Purchase Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.591" offset="1467831">At the time the lands were originally purchased the only method by which the State of California can terminate the purchase contract, would be to actually file a quiet title action, obtain a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.770" offset="1520494">Then the purchaser had 20 days after the judgment was entered within which to come in and redeem his purchase or by paying all back sums due plus all court costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.666" offset="1572112">Now, this particular Act was amended some 20 years after the original purchaser bought his land to provide that if the contracts were in default that the purchaser would have six months from the date of the Act within which to reinstate his purchase, otherwise, he completely loss everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.390" offset="1670959">And that particular original purchaser or his successor contended that this was an impairment of obligations of his contract and this Court held that it was not an obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.663" offset="1736056">That is merely a change of remedy or merely a change in the method by which the State terminated its contract which it could do from time to time so long as the modification was reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="606.516" offset="2531537">We both move for summary judgments consequently the case wouldn't as fully developed as we might have liked in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.295" offset="2574587">But the particular statute involved was submitted in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.103" offset="2597888">It's Chapter 191 of the Acts of 1941 of the Texas legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.152" offset="2618055">That particular statute is in two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.552" offset="2635609">The first part provided that the State or that the State provided that any purchaser of these lands could defer payments of the principal for the next four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.730" offset="2692347">The second part of the statute of -- added the five-year proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.344" offset="2718783">And as Mr. Simmons has pointed out in his brief, the State of Texas on many, many occasions have amended or modified this -- these Land Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.079" offset="2761728">The most common type of modification is that each two years, the State provides that the principal payments may be deferred that the purchasers need only pay interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.136" offset="2817944">Now, the record shows, I believe, that Mr. Simmons predecessors entitled avail themselves of the first section of this particular Act and now are complaining of the second section.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.831" offset="2872801">We think it's questionable whether they actually even have a right to complain since they avail themselves of the benefits conferred by the first section of this particular Act and now they complain about the five-year proviso in the second provision of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.807" offset="2960677">One other matter, I would like to bring up this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.759" offset="2976455">I think the provi -- and that is the Appendix K that's been submitted by the appellee wherein he made several requests for admissions while this case was pending on appeal in the United States Supreme Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Greenberry Simmons</label>
            <text syncTime="844.035" offset="3481558">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.546" offset="3523668">We've referred a great deal recently about the constitutional rights of the American Indians, and we have also heard a great deal about the constitutional rights of the American Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.499" offset="3619485">But very seldom that in this Court do we have the opportunity to direct our attention to the constitutional rights of the American settlers that helped settled up this western boundaries with reference to their homes and their home sites.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.920" offset="3713108">This is such a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.389" offset="3746962">We have gone into focus here the impairment of the obligation of contract Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution of which the members of this Court know long before well provides that no state shall pass any Act impairing the obligation of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.432" offset="3891158">Now, since that was put in, in this Constitution of ours, it has lost a great deal of its potentiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.624" offset="3935984">However, in regards to land grants by the State and contracts pertaining to land grants by the State and the Government, it still carries a quite of great deal of potentiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.634" offset="4032011">Now, before we can determine whether this contract has been impaired, we of course have to determine what the obligations of both parties were at the time the contract was made back in 1910, not and under the laws at that time, not under the laws as they might be today after being amended so many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.993" offset="4189372">Now, on page 67 of the record -- 67 of the record, we have the contract which is before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.541" offset="4255619">That contract was made by settlers Glenn and Kilpatrick in 1910, when it applied to the State of Texas for the purchase of their homes and their home sites.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.268" offset="4346525">Found down here about a third of the page from the bottom, we have the word which is hidden here O-B-L-I-G-A-T-I-O-N and of course the obligation of this contract is from there on down with reference to the statutes they refer to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.804" offset="4448611">Now, what does the obligation of this contract specifically express and stipulate as to the terms of the obligation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.023" offset="4505558">That's what we're -- we're trying to find out here, the obligation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.971" offset="4521336">I have this day prchased from the State of Texas under the provisions of and in accordance with, and let me emphasize that, under the provisions of and in accordance with Chapter 129 of the Acts of May 19, 1897, now there it is in the obligation of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.684" offset="4644216">Now, what does Chapter 129 say pertaining to the particular thing which is before this Court today namely the reinstatement of property which was already forfeited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.185" offset="4750169">At page 8 of the brief for the appellee, page 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.885" offset="4788935">There is set out two paragraphs there which take -- which is part of Chapter 129 which set out the obligations of both parties, the settlers and their vendees, and the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.382" offset="4863018">Now, what does it say?</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.430" offset="4875139">In the second paragraph here it says, this land is to be sold to settlers, actual settlers only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.845" offset="4916830">And after they have spent three years on their lands, they may have a patent at anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.218" offset="4958313">Now, that's fairly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.010" offset="4965522">I'm speaking now of the obligation of this contract, not just the contract itself, the obligation of this contract stipulated and expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.770" offset="5012543">What else does it say pertaining to this subject that we want to talk about?</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.272" offset="5034486">It says, if any of these lands are forfeited for the nonpayment of interest, they may be reinstated by the purchaser or the vendee by paying all back interest into the treasury and by giving written notice before the rights of third parties may have intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.419" offset="5179100">That means before this date sold that land to a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.226" offset="5218388">Now, what we have just discussed here are the obligations of the State to do certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.365" offset="5266871">What?</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.885" offset="5272931">If these settlers pay their back interest before they resell it to some third person, then what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.527" offset="5323504">This contract comes back into being just the same as it was when it's written.</text>
