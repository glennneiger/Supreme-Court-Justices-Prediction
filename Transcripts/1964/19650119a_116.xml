            <text syncTime="230.681" offset="922645">Then a later case, Pacific Employers versus Industrial Accident Commission was also involved, the California Industrial Commission, which also would involve the Massachusetts Compensation Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.643" offset="1146567">Then, he filed a common law action in Arkansas and this Court held that it was permissive for the Arkansas to disregard the entire Compensation Act of Missouri and give him his common law or common law remedy in Arkansas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1091.414" offset="4365584">But, the rule is well settled that where the provision for the liability is coupled with a provision for the special remedy, that remedy, that alone must be employed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1868.924" offset="7475618">Now, when the petitioner went into the Circuit Court of the DeKalb County, he first sued on an Alabama count under the Alabama Compensation Law, and then he struck it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.410" offset="7537580">But Alabama could have entertained jurisdiction and given this petitioner an award under the Alabama Compensation Law under the cases of the holdings of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1931.172" offset="7724617">I do say this to you, that this trial court in the DeKalb County, Alabama gave a lump sum award of $10,000, then he awarded an attorney's fee of 33.30% or $3,500 which he didn't have a right to do either under the Georgia statute or Alabama statute because the Alabama statute limits it to 15% and the State Board in Georgia sets the attorney's fees in the cases litigated or tried under the Georgia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.506" offset="7837989">And another thing, under Alabama law, he didn't even have the right to make a lump sum award unless both parties agreed to it, and that is the same -- that's -- the same thing is true under the Georgia statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1990.799" offset="7963167">It is difficult to understand why the petitioner rely so heavily on the Pacific Employers liability case in his brief because in recognizing the rule of law which controls this case at bar, here's what this Court said in the Pacific Employers case, “Full Faith and Credit would deny to California the right to apply its own remedy and its administrative machinery,” well, let me get that, “Full Faith and Credit would deny to California the right to apply its own remedy and its administrative machinery may well not be adopted to give him the remedy afforded by Massachusetts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.589" offset="8134322">Similarly, now similarly, the Full Faith and Credit demanded for the California Act would deny to Massachusetts the rights to apply its own remedy and its Department of Industrial Accidents may well be without statutory authority to afford the remedy provided by the California statute.</text>
