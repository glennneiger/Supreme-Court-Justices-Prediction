            <text syncTime="13.552" offset="54126">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.536" offset="70113">Certiorari was granted in this case to review a decision of the California Supreme Court which held that since mental hospitals serve a proper public function that it is a denial of the Equal Protection Clause for a state to require a patient's close family members to reimburse in any part for the cause of the patient's care at the state hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.136" offset="196441">The California statute imposed a joint and several liability upon the patient's estate, the spouse, parents, and children.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.332" offset="253283">Pursuant to this statute, the Department of Mental Hygiene filed a claim in the estate of a deceased daughter for the care of her mother at Agnews State Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.157" offset="308558">The respondent -- the Administratrix of the estate rejected this claim and this action was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.928" offset="339696">The respondent's contention throughout the proceeding was that the mother's estate must be completely exhausted before any liability would pass to the patient's estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.617" offset="398420">Both parties moot for judgment on the pleadings and judgment was granted to the Department of Mental Hygiene.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.114" offset="432379">Now -- although, it is irrelevant under a joint and several obligations, and solely to refute the implication that the Department of Mental Hygiene did act in an arbitrary fashion and proceeding against the estate of the deceased daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.959" offset="503745">I want to make it clear that the mother's estate although of some $11,000 was not available for her support.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.044" offset="548153">It was subject to a lien by the Department of Mental Hygiene as we have set forth quite clearly in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.890" offset="591517">Now, we'd like to point out that amicus curiae, the American Federation for the Blind, who has failed the brief and behalf of respondents agrees with our contention that this was an impoverished person.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.631" offset="654524">The District Court of Appeal confirmed the decision of the Superior Court, the Supreme Court of California reversed with its precedent shattering decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.614" offset="710426">So the issue framed -- the issue before this Court was sold frames -- was framed completely by the court below and not by the parties as to whether it is a denial of the Equal Protection Clause for a state to require reimbursement from financially closed -- from close relatives who are financially able to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.192" offset="7048673">I think that this California Court's decision is based upon two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.579" offset="7066227">Number one is the one we are talking about and the California Courts says, “That where a patient has an estate of her own, one adult cannot be required to support the other adult”, and simply for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.029" offset="7124114">If the patient has her estate of her own, the daughter has no more responsibility to support her mother who has in the estate of her own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.500" offset="7153998">Then I have a responsibility to support that same mother or that you would have a responsibility to support that same mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.320" offset="7185241">And any statute that requires a daughter to support a mother who has an estate of her own, improperly classifies his daughter under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.173" offset="7220663">Now as we argue from the very first appearance in this action, and at that time, we followed demurer to this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.101" offset="7260369">And the grounds of the demurer were -- was a single demurer that the complaint fails to see the cause of action and that the plaintiff failed to allege that the patient had no estate of her own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.559" offset="7314181">You see, under the laws of State of California, where a parent has no estate or a parent is a distressed person, a child is liable for the parent's support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.655" offset="7366531">That issue is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.564" offset="7382204">If they had enabled to allege that the parent was a needy person then they would have stated the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.654" offset="7418567">Then our complaints against any decision growing out of that complaint would not have been substantiated as they are here because, had the complaint alleged that the mother was a needy person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.158" offset="7472588">There would have been a justification for the classification that the daughter was a class person who is required to take care of the patient and simply because the patient was a needy person.</text>
