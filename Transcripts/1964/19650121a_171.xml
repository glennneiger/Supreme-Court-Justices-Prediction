            <text syncTime="45.153" offset="180558">On November 5th, 1961, the petitioner, a citizen of Ohio, received severe and crippling injuries in an automobile accident in South Carolina because of the alleged negligence of the respondent's (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="61.317" offset="245238">She commenced suit in the United States District Court in the District of Massachusetts against the respondent, a citizen of Massachusetts, and has been effectively barred from ever having a hearing on the merits of her claim because she complied with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.304" offset="317127">The respondent qualified as executor by filing a performance bond in the probate court are in March 1st, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.728" offset="354847">The complaint in this action was filed on February 6th, 1963 and service was made in full compliance with Rule 4 (d) (1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure when the United States Marshall left a copy of the summons and the complaint at the respondent's dwelling house in the hands of his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.704" offset="446798">Section 9 of Chapter 197 of the Massachusetts General Laws provides in substance that an action against an executor must first be commenced within a year of his giving bond, that it must be served within a year, and that service must be made personally upon the executor unless a statutory notice of the suit has been filed in the probate court or unless the executor accepts service.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.283" offset="561110">The respondent filed his answer in the United States District Court on February 26th, 1963, two days prior to the expiration of the time limited by the Massachusetts statute here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.573" offset="614191">On August 5th, the respondent filed interrogatories and on August 26th, he moved for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.777" offset="643030">The motion was allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.084" offset="648255">The District Court holding that under the doctrine of Guaranty Trust versus York and Ragan versus Merchants Transfer Company, the motion would have to be allowed because service was made pursuant to the federal rules and not under Massachusetts statute, Section 9, Chapter 197.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.270" offset="720980">Timely appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit which affirmed the decision of the District Court on April 29th.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.653" offset="750550">This Court granted our petition for writ of certiorari on October 12th, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.505" offset="777927">The issue in this case is whether in a case where federal jurisdiction is based solely on diversity of citizenship between the litigants, service upon an executor shall be made in the mode and manner prescribed by state law or in the mode and manner prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.712" offset="854831">Now, the action in this case was commenced within the year and service was made within the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.770" offset="879073">Therefore, timeliness of this action is not an issue on this appeal, and it is for this reason that the instant case is distinguishable from Ragan versus Merchants Transfer Company and Guaranty Trust Company versus York, relied on by the courts below and by the respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.396" offset="949499">Unlike those cases, the application of Rule 4 (d) (1) in this case does not link from the time in which Mrs. Hannah had to maintain her action by one instant, at least in this respect, the defendant -- the respondent has not been prejudiced by the application of the federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.749" offset="1022955">Though stated broadly, the issue in this case is whether there shall be one rule governing service of process in the United States District Courts whether there shall be 50.</text>

            <text syncTime="273.983" offset="1095889">In the affidavit, in support of his motion for summary judgment, the respondent averred only that he did not accept service.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.918" offset="1123579">That's on page 17 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.201" offset="1132774">He never averred that he did not have actual notice of the pendency of the action and in view of the fact that the answer was filed within the year, I think it's reasonable to assume that he did have actual notice of the case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert P. Zabin</label>
            <text syncTime="303.096" offset="1212291">I believe, Your Honor, that it would not, except in answer to the decision of the Court of Appeals, this reasoning that the -- this is a matter of substance because of the legislative policy of Massachusetts, simply to point out to the Court that in fact in this case, to whatever with -- if any weight at all should be given to the Massachusetts' policy, that policy has been substantially satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.655" offset="1306540">We submit that the application of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in this case was not only permissible but was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.281" offset="1349068">Section 2072 of Title 28, the so-called Enabling Act, empowers this Court to promulgate Rules of Civil Procedure with the limitations only that these rules may not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right and of course may not affect the right of trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.499" offset="1421897">Now, Rule 4 (d) (1) promulgated under that statute has the force of a congressional statute and we submit that the court below could have properly refused to apply this rule only if the application of this rule transcended the rule making authority the Act confers on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.845" offset="1507370">We think that it clearly does not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.684" offset="1518655">Now, under the standard of Sibbach versus Wilson, I think it is clear that the application of Rule 4 (d) (1) governs practice and procedure in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.305" offset="1561182">The contention however, the dispute in the case, is whether it affects the substantive rights of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.983" offset="1595873">We suggest that service of process is merely the manner in which the litigant is given noted -- notice of a suit pending against him and the formal manner in which a court asserts jurisdiction over the person who litigate -- over the person who's the litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.788" offset="1671105">We'd hardly see how the manner in which a party is notified in the suit and the manner in which the Court asserts jurisdiction over him can ever remotely affect the outcome or the course that the litigation takes.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.701" offset="1734740">Now, since this action is timely, the only substantive rights involved in this case are those rights which are created by the law of South Carolina where the accident occurred and which would be recognized by Massachusetts under the normal application of its rules of conflicts of laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.157" offset="1812584">No one, none of the courts below nor I gather the respondent argues that these rights having all been affected by the application of Rule 4 (d) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="464.203" offset="1856784">The Court of Appeals, however, reasoned that the legislative purpose of Massachusetts turned this application of Rule 4 (d) (1) from a matter of mere procedure to a matter of substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.833" offset="1907252">We suggest to this Court that this involves, first, a misinterpretation of the Enabling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.995" offset="1931912">We suggest that a state may have policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.801" offset="1943197">It may have purposes which, in appropriate cases, may be respected by a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.705" offset="1970782">But as such, in private civil litigation, a state does not have a substantive right.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.049" offset="1996173">Further, the reasoning of the court below, it creates a test which is almost impossible to apply because if this is not reversed, then whenever there is a conflict between a federal rule and a state statute, the District Court for each state and for each statute will have to determine the strength of the state policy and reliance on the federal rules is likely to become a trap for any counsel who does not fully comply with state rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="605.573" offset="2422282">Well, I should say, Your Honor, that that interpretation would require a reading of the Enabling Act, the term "substantive right" I think in a strange manner, whereas I argue before and I think that as you, Your Honor points out, a state may have an interest but it doesn't have a substantive right.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.949" offset="2511726">And the limitation on this Court is only, aside from the question of jury trial is only that it may not abridge, modify, or enlarge a substantive right.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.315" offset="2545162">And I think that limitation must be read only as it applies to the rights of the litigants.</text>

            <text syncTime="641.843" offset="2567314">In other words you -- (Inaudible) maybe the rule ought to be admitted and the petitioner is going to do this and if you don't concede (Inaudible) substantive right.</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert P. Zabin</label>
            <text syncTime="652.881" offset="2611513">That's right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.124" offset="2632411">The most important result of a failure to reverse the Court of Appeals would be the beginning of the destruction of uniformity of federal procedure because if the Massachusetts legislature policy is to be given controlling weight here, then the policy of every state which has a rule of procedure different from the federal rules must also be given weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.434" offset="2733662">And I think that this would be the beginning of the destruction of uniformity of federal procedure which is after all a policy of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.406" offset="2777548">Now, the respondent has argued in his brief that were this action in a state court on March 1st, 1963, the date when the period of limitations expired, the plaintiff would have had no enforceable rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.854" offset="2839406">And secondly, he argues that the statute involved here deals with the administration of estates.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.634" offset="2862498">We suggest that his first argument really begs the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.894" offset="2879530">The test so far, of whether or not state law rather than federal law applies in a diversity case is whether a litigant could predict before the forum is selected, that an outcome in each form will be substantially different because of the differing rules to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.353" offset="2949329">Now, what the respondent has done is he has looked at the penalty which -- within -- which in Massachusetts Court would impose for failure to apply with its own -- comply with its own statute without first determining whether or not the application of the state statute is required in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.801" offset="3031144">If this is the -- going to be the test, then it means that whenever there is a difference between state statute and a federal rule and the state court would apply a penalty for the failure to comply with its statute then in every case, the state statute would have to take precedence over the federal rule in a federal court, viewed prospectively, as we suggest this Court has done in the past, the method of service cannot affect the outcome of the litigation and the method of service is not going to be a factor in counsel's thinking in determining whether to bring an action in the federal court in -- or in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.423" offset="3197597">As to the respondent's second contention, we suggest that the part of the Massachusetts statute here involved does not deal with the settlement of estates.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.390" offset="3241482">It does not even deal with the method of notifying an executor of a claim against the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.449" offset="3265724">It deals only with the method of notifying the executor of the pendency of an action in court against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.896" offset="3295504">The cases relied on by the respondent are distinguishable from the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.784" offset="3319118">His leading case seems to be Security Trust Company cited on page 7 of his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.006" offset="3340016">That case, like Ragan and Guaranty Trust, involved the timeliness of the suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="852.639" offset="3410547">And, in Young, they also cited on page 7 of the respondent's brief, the Court dealt with the question of whether a federal judgment creditor of an estate had a better position, vis-à-vis the other creditors, than a state judgment creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.540" offset="3466136">Now, in the instant case, the application of Rule 4 (d) (1) does not give Mrs. Hannah a better position than any other creditor there may be.</text>

            <text syncTime="934.097" offset="3736346">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.729" offset="3794860">Relative to the facts in this case, as my Brother has portrayed them, essentially, there is no conflict and the facts are very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.961" offset="3839791">I think, however, there are one or two items that perhaps we could clarify in which in -- later in my argument, will have a bearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.498" offset="3869989">One, there never was any in hand service and relative to the return of service, page 2 of the transcript of records, the return of service is indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.424" offset="3925682">The service was by last and usual service, leaving it with the wife, and namely Mrs. Edward M. Plumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.193" offset="3964761">On page 17 of that same transcript is the affidavit of Mr. Edward M. Plumer, Jr. that he did not receive the service as far as this particular action or anything relating to this action is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.991" offset="4043964">Particularly, the issue as my Brother portrays it, is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.015" offset="4076042">The statute is clearly set forth in the words that I am concerned with, in which the Circuit Court of Appeals was concerned with, are the words that the Executor or admini -- or the administrator shall not be forced to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.377" offset="4153469">Now, this mandatory language which sets forth a definite and definitive time in which to act and to follow certain alternatives was never complied with at any time, and this is admitted by the petitioner in his argument -- in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.460" offset="4245838">The statute particularly does more than merely provide for notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.665" offset="4274573">It creates a defense, and I think that the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals indicates the legislative intent or concern with the Massachusetts statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.303" offset="4337162">I think it can be said that the Massachusetts Court in part, particularly the case of Parker versus Rich, indicates that an end to litigation be had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.116" offset="4380421">It indicates a definite in -- a definite interest that actual notice without question be had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.802" offset="4427128">I will shortly cover the effects that this decision would have should this Court reverse the Circuit Court of Appeals' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.206" offset="4468820">But the statute does give more than notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.176" offset="4480627">It creates a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.028" offset="4488046">It creates a duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.649" offset="4494524">And the Massachusetts cases have been clear, I think, to indicate a strengthening of this policy rather than a weakening of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.686" offset="4530678">Now, the Guaranty Trust case indicates to us the essential test of whether the outcome will be substantially the same in both the federal and state courts sitting in the same state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.958" offset="4595775">My Brother has cited the Sibbach versus Wilson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.618" offset="4618449">Now, this case, Sibbach versus Wilson, also gives us the definition of procedure or at least what that court at that time felt was a definition for procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.686" offset="4666723">And particularly, it indicated that it was the enforcement of rights rather than any words which would indicate a creation of rights which General Laws Chapter 197, Section 9, we submit, does do that it does create rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1345.867" offset="5383419">There was never -- the initial complaint, as indicated in the transcript, indicates that the petitioner had fully complied with the Massachusetts General Laws relating to a commencement of actions under General Law, Chapter 197.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.875" offset="5435455">That's the statute we're concerned with.</text>

            <text syncTime="1441.068" offset="5764180">Now, the facts of this case were that the suit was commenced well before, but never any notice was ever filed as a result of that, for that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.544" offset="5794168">Thus, there was never a compliance as a proper matter of this -- with the statute at all, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.137" offset="5824470">The Sibbach case, once again, does give us an indication of what the Court considers to be procedural.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.795" offset="5867102">In the brief of the petitioners, the case of Iovino and Waterson wherein there is an attempt to indicate that this case is the foundation upon which this Court could reverse a decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.198" offset="5956754">I submit this case does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.357" offset="5965427">It has no bearing in this case for one reason, as far as the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.751" offset="5986952">In the Iovino versus Waterson case, we had a motor vehicle accident in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.193" offset="6012761">And as a result of this, an action was commenced with service in hand upon a New Jersey resident in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.896" offset="6039510">Actual service was had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.389" offset="6057482">The Court in that case goes into rather lengthy discussion of the purpose of the Mas -- of the New York statute as to the substitution of parties, but the action had been commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.869" offset="6127386">The only question as regarding the federal rules here were the fact that they weren't going to continue it, end it, get rid of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.184" offset="6156643">That is not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.724" offset="6162808">Our case was never started while the decedent was living under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.917" offset="6195618">The Iovino case also specifically states and brings forth the fact that the statute concerned was not a mandatory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.067" offset="6248176">It was not an expressed mandate of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.490" offset="6261864">It expressly states in that decision that they are aware of this and they give us the basis for action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.643" offset="6302511">I think that the ultimate effect of a reversal of the Circuit Court of Appeals decision is that a person from outside the State of Massachusetts can come in to a federal court without any compliance whatsoever and secure rights that no resident of that state may have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.564" offset="6410240">Now, I think it's academic that the state or the commonwealth has a right to determine the method and disposition and administration of the (Inaudible) of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.007" offset="6463948">I think that the statute, for a good many years, has been sustained in its policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.147" offset="6492578">I think that, with regard to the question of whether there was any conflict, that we could look to the case of Cohen versus Beneficial Loan which, by inadvertence was left out of the respondent's brief which case -- where the case where a New Jersey statute provided that in a derivative shareholders' suit, that the federal court ins -- could insist that a bond be filed before any action could be had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.632" offset="6638446">The plaintiff in that action did not comply and as a result thereof, a motion for summary judgment was granted and the matter then came on for appellate action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.796" offset="6695184">The Court in the decision indicates this that they looked to the policy of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.228" offset="6732904">I submit that looking for the policy in this statute will cause the -- and we hope the court to protect the rights of all its citizens and the intention of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.539" offset="6798106">The Court also looked to the fiduciary relationship of a stockholder to his other stockholders into the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.560" offset="6830184">I think the Court here is also concerned with the policy that wasteless litigation or that litigation, if it be had, must come to an end at some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.630" offset="6882429">The Court in that case, also, said that there was no conflict between the law of New York and the federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.585" offset="6922240">We submit in this case that there is no conflict between the federal rules and the law of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.948" offset="6951706">The law of Massachusetts is substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.001" offset="6975948">It creates rights, duties, obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.258" offset="6992980">It protects property.</text>

            <text syncTime="1814.946" offset="7259742">The effect of reversing the decision will -- of the court below will not in anyway harm the policy of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.259" offset="7304986">It will not give any outsider a right which a local resident does not have except to be governed by the more modern Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for an outsider, of course, can take depositions if he brings his action to the federal court, which he cannot do if he brings his action in a local court in Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.651" offset="7394534">And yet no one would suggest that the taking of depositions was a substantive right within the meaning of the Enabling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.706" offset="7426821">Finally, as to the question as to whether or not a state policy is a legitimate standard for determining whether or not the application of a federal rule has transcended the rulemaking power of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.692" offset="7486694">In the two cases in which the terms that I know of, in which the term "state policy" was used, Cohen versus Beneficial Loan Company and the Bernhardt case, the term "state policy" was used in the context of the substantial benefits to the litigants which was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.808" offset="7555135">Now, in Cohen, what was involved there was the right of the defendant to be secure in all his costs in maintaining the litigation, counsel fees as well as the normal court cost and this Court has held was that as a matter of -- was a substantive right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.335" offset="7629322">Now, there is no equivalent benefit to the respondent under the Massachusetts statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.354" offset="7653355">The only right he has, if it's a right at all, is the right to have the service given to him directly by the serving officer rather than have it being given to him by his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.812" offset="7707167">Thank you.</text>
