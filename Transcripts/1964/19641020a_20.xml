            <label>Mr. Edward S. Irons</label>
            <text syncTime="34.438" offset="137718">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.453" offset="145763">This is an action for an accounting for royalties due under a patent license agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.610" offset="182439">The license agreement was not for a single patent but rather for a package or group of patents many of which expired during the license term.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.991" offset="235938">The action was brought to collect the royalties for the continuing right to use machines covered by the expired patents, none of the other patents in the package being incorporated into the machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.627" offset="298423">The Supreme Court of the State of Washington held as a matter of law that parties might contract to pay post-expiration royalties and that there was no legal or equitable reason why they should not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.469" offset="365819">The issue basically for consideration therefore is whether that holding by the Supreme Court of the State of Washington was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.381" offset="413466">The position of the petitioners is that it is incorrect for two basic reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.238" offset="440947">The first reason is that the primary premise upon which the patents laws are based is the constitutional one that the patent shall be for a limited term.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.377" offset="501447">Underlying this concept is the further consideration that the patent is granted on condition that when it expires the invention shall be available to the free use of the public and that the patentee is foreclosed from compromising in any way the dedication which was the condition on which he got the grant in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.610" offset="610429">It therefore follows that any attempt to compromise that dedication by the collection of royalties by private contract after expiration is of course contrary and in violation of the primary bargain with the people which the patents represents.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.877" offset="683468">And it is that primary bargain with the people requiring the dedication as a matter of law and as a matter of constitutional principle which must control over any private contract which seeks a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.714" offset="742818">The second and I believe equally important reason why the decision of the Supreme Court of Washington was wrong is because as has been repeatedly recognized, the subject matter, the invention of a patent which has expired is indeed dedicated, it is unpatented.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.399" offset="837590">And so therefore, a private contract which extends the right to collect royalties to that unpatented subject matter is on its face an extension of the monopoly to unpatented materials and derogation not only of the principles of the patent laws but of the principles in antitrust laws as they had been applied in analogous situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="471.673" offset="1886668">I will certainly do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.521" offset="1898057">I want to finish my comments that I was making on these package licenses and essentially it is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.398" offset="1929509">A patent owner has a basic patent or patents which are needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.145" offset="1948526">These are the appeal to sell the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.879" offset="1963468">He does not license them alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.663" offset="1970573">He licensed them -- licenses them in a package with other patents pending with know-how with trademarks which may exist in perpetuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.448" offset="2005786">Now, it is self-evident that the appeal, the reason for the agreement to pay the royalty in the first place was the need for the basic patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.703" offset="2042776">But the terms of these agreements extend long after the basic patents expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.201" offset="2064718">And the royalties continue undiminished on the pretext that there are still some considerations in the form of some patent maybe not even thought off when the agreement was signed but it went to patents which might be pending or trademarks or know-how or some other form of right which may exist in perpetuity.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.499" offset="2137966">I think it is a simple matter of logic that however much of that consideration was allocable to the basic patents at the beginning, continuous to be paid, there's no provision in these agreements for a reallocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.744" offset="2190942">And certainly, any such arrangement necessarily results in a perpetuation of the tribute paid for the right to use the expired inventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.184" offset="2232633">These are contractual arrangements by which the consequences of the dedication which is the condition on which the patent is granted in the first place are obviated and avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.359" offset="2281430">These are standard business practices in the sense that there are great many licenses of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.651" offset="2314553">My position is that -- as this Court has emphasized in a somewhat different context, each patent must stand on its own feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.523" offset="2350080">The person who wishes to acquire a license under the patent must be free to deal with it on its own merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.796" offset="2375158">It must not borrow quality from some other patent by any means, because if it does, this enlarges the monopoly of the patent from which it borrows quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.758" offset="2418939">Manifestly, that's what happened in our case at the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.053" offset="2432209">There were presumably seven patents that were needed and that's why, the licenses were taken in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.202" offset="2456764">The licenses however extended for years after those expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.374" offset="2473482">The Court below found that the others were mere surplus and the parties gave no consideration to those as a part of the package and insofar as the basis for consideration was concerned.And so it recognized that the license did require post-expiration royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.651" offset="2550596">It expressly held that it did and the obligation to pay them was enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.784" offset="2575047">Now to specifically answer your question, there was a provision in these agreements in Paragraph 7 which the licensor put in there in anticipation of this very circumstance and it said that the royalty shall continue with an undiminished rate throughout the term regardless of the expiration of any patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.213" offset="2652787">On these particular agreements before the Court, it's not a matter of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.231" offset="2668878">It's a matter of the actual provisions in the agreement itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.627" offset="2686433">The same principles apply in a more general situation in which I have addressed myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.763" offset="2710988">I want -- now to comment very briefly on another argument which the respondent has made and I think the brief comment is all that would be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.541" offset="2762083">It is argued by the respondent that this maybe that they are post-expiration royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.497" offset="2785907">But these were voluntarily agreed to and they were not coerced and since they were voluntary agreed to it, there's nothing wrong with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.149" offset="2820493">The position of the petitioner is that this is clearly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.205" offset="2836793">The constitution in these patent statutes permit patents only for limited terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.792" offset="2863125">This Court repeatedly has held that when the patent expires, the monopoly seizes to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.639" offset="2886531">That no part of it can be recaptured by any means and that no private contract can extend the monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.405" offset="2917564">And so I say, it's just as illegal to extend that monopoly by a so-called voluntary private agreement as it is by any other kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.984" offset="2951837">And it is therefore, not material in the context of collecting post-expiration royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.531" offset="2978064">The -- whether or not the agreement was coerced ab initio.</text>

            <text syncTime="943.271" offset="3773022">He sold what he called naked title to it, but pointedly quote, “without the right to use”.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.076" offset="3800294">So whoever purchase this for 3000 odd dollars add machine he couldn't use.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.616" offset="3822446">And to use it, he had to take this patent license including the post-expiration royalty provisions of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.508" offset="3850031">And to sell it, he not only had to find the purchaser but he -- they had to find a purchaser who would also take the patent license.</text>

            <text syncTime="971.639" offset="3886498">This is an effort to avoid the normal consequence of the sale of the patented device, and a license arises as a matter of law when a patented device is sold usually.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.781" offset="3939056">It -- to use the shorthand expression, extinguishes the monopoly and the machine is free of the patent after it is sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.255" offset="3976986">That law was avoided in this case by the sale of the title only, without the right to use and the requirement that you get the right to use, you must take this license which extended the monopoly of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.683" offset="4058697">I have, I think treated the basic arguments which are advanced by the respondent, namely the voluntary matter and the matter of the royalties being justified as consideration for unexpired patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.402" offset="4121600">I want to conclude by pointing out that this Court in every context in which it has appeared has recognized that the dedication of a patent is absolute and cannot be compromised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.439" offset="4173740">It happened early in the Law of Double Patenting which precludes a second patent for the same invention on exactly these grounds in the Singer and Kellogg cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.970" offset="4219820">It was held that when a patent expired, the public right to use the invention including the very form on which it was produced under the patent passed to the public, together with the right to use the name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.129" offset="4272483">Singer in one case, (Inaudible) in the other so that the right would not be qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.653" offset="4294531">In Scott Paper Company, it was held that a doctrine of estoppel arising under common law contract which would normally have prevented the assignor from challenging the validity of the signed patent did not operate because if it were permitted to operate, the primary public right would be compromised, and of course the later cases are Sears and Comco which were decided in February of this year I believe, once they held that a state could not grant patents of its own or otherwise operating in such a way to compromise the paramount public right in the subject matter of a patent which had expired or in that case had been invalidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.493" offset="4469969">Also, as I have said obviously under these decisions that which was once patented but it is no more is unqualifiedly in the public domain, a contract which extends the monopoly to that material clashes head on with the doctrine that the antitrust laws forbid, the extension of the patent monopoly by contract to unpatented materials.</text>

            <text syncTime="1494.198" offset="5976712">But if you contract and say, “I will let you use my patent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.339" offset="6401254">Let's look at it in another context if I may please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.436" offset="6417659">At the beginning there were -- let say 12 patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.451" offset="6429780">Seven were used, some were not used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.796" offset="6447125">The royalty rate was fixed at that time at $5 per bale plus $500 a year, minimum royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.299" offset="6473143">This royalty was for package.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.164" offset="6480562">Obviously, and as the court below I think found, the primary consideration for that royalty was for the patents that were used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.467" offset="6513789">It had to be, because there weren't any others used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.060" offset="6524238">The court below said there was no interests in the ones that there were not used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.840" offset="6539285">Now, they expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.210" offset="6552764">Nobody ever used them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.498" offset="6561959">At the beginning, these $5 a bale and $500 a year minimum was in part allocable certainly, if not entirely to the patents which were used after they expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.258" offset="6620996">You have to make a reallocation of this royalty and say, “Now, we're going to pay the same amount of money for patents we don't need.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.106" offset="6660389">This was never contemplated in the minds of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.328" offset="6677211">They didn't pay anything and had no intention of paying anything for the right to use these patents they didn't need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.407" offset="6701558">But more particularly, in the context of package licenses when this Court has considered it particularly in paramount in laws, it is repeated again and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.549" offset="6738129">Each patent must stand on its own feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.556" offset="6746175">You must not borrow quality one from the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.599" offset="6758296">You must be able to deal with them individually in the market place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.227" offset="6772820">Certainly, these patents that were needed barred quality from the ones that were -- or it wouldn't be paying for them years after the ones that were needed expired.</text>

            <text syncTime="1805.562" offset="7222230">But if you have a package of patents, you certainly are going to have to make provisions in that package license so that the royalties are reduced as they expire or some other provision is put into these agreements so that the paramount right and the dedicated invention is not compromised.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.124" offset="7404460">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.076" offset="7420238">We believe that the petitioner's position here is entirely unsound both as a matter of fact and as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.941" offset="7459736">First, let me briefly clarify several important undisputed factual matters that have immaterial bearing on both of those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.489" offset="7497874">Under the expressed language of these contracts, the mid-annual minimum warranty of the $500 per machine plus the 4% sales tax was payable irrespective entirely of the standard use of the machines during any year and irrespective of whether the machines were used at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.119" offset="7596408">In other words, it was about the -- for -- particularly of our concern whether the machines were used or the extent they were used the minimum royalties were payable in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.957" offset="7643742">And the judgment center appealed from here for the -- insofar as they were entered, they cover a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.937" offset="7687732">But the judgments that were entered for the years 1957 and subsequent years of -- were only for the minimum royalty not for anything in addition to the minimum royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.058" offset="7760144">It is undisputed that these two petitioners had hired the use of the competitive larger and newer stationary machine that were owned by their neighbors or their relatives and paid for that use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.191" offset="7844676">The -- here, there is no monopoly in hop-picking machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.852" offset="7871321">As a matter of fact, the stationery machines have come into such favor although much more expensive that since 1947, there has been a manufacture or sale of not a single new portable picking machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.451" offset="7945718">On the other hand, the suggestion in the reply brief here that these portable machines had become obsolete is utterly absurd and completely contrary to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.431" offset="7993678">Fees has not interfered or attempted to interfere in any measure with the use of any of these machines or any of these patented inventions subsequent to expiration of any of the patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.307" offset="8069224">We've not brought any injunction suit or anything of that kind, either as to the general public or as to the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.402" offset="8113528">Admittedly as to -- this is an over simplification, but as to a particular single patent, permit expires admittedly the invention becomes in the public domain and the public has a right to use it and that seems to be one of the petitioner's principle contentions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.815" offset="8195239">That in some way we're interfering with that but we have not interfered with that as to the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.734" offset="8222929">We have not interfered with that as to the petitioners except merely that we're asking for the payment of certain money by the petitioners, based upon the contracts that they entered into.</text>

            <text syncTime="2658.731" offset="10634867">If Your Honors please, I wish to emphasize that not a single decision of this Court cited by petitioners is a patent royalty case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.356" offset="10685336">They are patent infringement, injunction suits or antitrust suits or something of that kind and the only one or two decisions of lower courts that they have cited are royalty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.932" offset="10727654">I'd like now to refer to the Hazeltine decision of this Court because I submit that it is conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.387" offset="10761509">It was a royalty contract case which provided for a royalty based on a percentage of the total gross sales of the licensee including both patented articles and unpatented articles, plus secondly, a -- an annual minimum royalty not of a measly $500 as in this case, but $10,000 per year annual minimum royalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.998" offset="10883971">And that this Court affirmed a summary judgment granted by the court below in favor of the plaintiff and upheld the legality of the contract and the royalty arrangements in both respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.490" offset="10953874">The same defenses were made, misuse of patents, violation of antitrust law and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.164" offset="10988565">To be sure if one of them -- and I say if the Court had discussed at greater length the specific question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.002" offset="11019912">But the record in that -- the question necessarily was decided even though not fully discussed, I submit, the record in the Hazeltine case shows that a large number of patents, I believe about half of them had expired and others had been invalidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.540" offset="11102145">The Court there emphasized, which is true factually in this case that there was never any request of a licensee for a different kind of royalty arrangement and/or refusal to give a different kind of royalty arrangement which is absolutely the fact here that that's undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.982" offset="11191902">Either the petitioners or anyone else ever requested anything different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.728" offset="11210815">And to suggest, as petitioners do, that if I may say so, this Court did not know what was doing or that there was an oversight in making a decision, I submit is utterly absurd because the issues were directly raised in each of the three courts, including this Court, and especially, in view of the dissenting opinion which expressly referred to the fact that the case involved, expired patents, and invalidated patents and the dissenting opinion in that connection citing the Scott case which is -- which petitioners principally relied -- rely on and had been decided only five years previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.533" offset="11374132">So, I submit that the Hazeltine case does decide these matters and is conclusive and controlling and has been generally followed in many royalty contracts since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.938" offset="11435677">And as I read the case, the Court considers in the same category unpatented articles and articles as to which the patents had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.679" offset="11494713">Both of which would be in the public domain and which is in line with the reasoning of this Court in the recent Sears, Roebuck, the Stiffel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.109" offset="11532434">So, I submit that that -- the case is conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.774" offset="11551033">The Court there also distinguished and held inapplicable the line of cases strongly relied upon by petitioners here, the tie-in cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.940" offset="11591680">Well, the Hazeltine held are that those are not applicable at all to this kind of a situation and certainly they are not applicable here because these never insisted or required that unpatented articles or materials they used in connection with these machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.180" offset="11668689">And that is the essence of the tie-in cases so that they are not applicable here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.102" offset="11700349">I submit that in final essence, this is closely analogous, if I may say so, to a situation of judges or teachers or policeman's retirement pensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.816" offset="11755207">They are deferred of partial compensation for benefits previously received and it seems to me that that is the situation here and certainly there is nothing immoral or against public policy about them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2995.764" offset="11982994">The -- what the Scott case hold is that -- and all that it holds, that was not a royalty but a patent infringement suit and it held that the plaintiff could not enjoin the use of an invention covered by a previous expired patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.884" offset="12063451">There, it had been assigned by the defendant to the plaintiff and they held the defendant was not estopped to raise the defense of invalidity because it was covered by an expired patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.687" offset="12106710">Well, here as I mentioned before, we have not and are not withholding from the public the use of anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.336" offset="12141296">It is merely a matter of dollars and not of use, not of extension of the monopoly or anything of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.444" offset="12173688">I submit that there's nothing against public policy at all in an extension of voluntary, neutrally convenient financing arrangement of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.502" offset="12217992">On the contrary, it seems to me that for at least two reasons public policy requires affirmance of these judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.289" offset="12249130">First, it is well settled by decisions of this Court that in the absence of serious public injury or possibly fraud in the state or something of that kind, that public is a paramount -- public policy requires freedom of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.607" offset="12314331">While here, I submit there is no serious public injury at all in permitting recovery on contracts of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.514" offset="12349962">Secondly, the validity and enforceability of arrangements of this nature, I submit is necessary for or certainly desirable from the standpoint of agricultural financing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.018" offset="12416000">Farmers like industry have to mechanize.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.060" offset="12432196">Many of them are small, undercapitalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.583" offset="12446302">If Your Honors strike down a convenient financing arrangement of this kind, it seems to me the effect would be frankly disastrous for undercapitalized smaller farmers or industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.299" offset="12497189">So I submit that this is in accordance with the public policy and should be permitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3259.668" offset="13038655">We're merely act -- asking that they pay the balance of the agreed compensation or royalties which they voluntarily agreed to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.531" offset="13090064">The great weight of authority and the better reasoning, I submit, sustains our position and Your Honors, I submit, should adhere to the Hazeltine case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.254" offset="13136980">The tax writers, Walker and Ellis and Corpus Juris Secundum and so forth, all definitely state the law in accordance with our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.825" offset="13187239">The lower federal courts are practically unanimous to the decisions of the Third Circuit which I believe are distinguishable which I won't go into now but that is referred to into the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.159" offset="13240633">Every state court which has considered the matter has held in accordance with this rule mainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.434" offset="13265711">That -- if a contract is silent on the subject, it is automatically presumed that the royalty obligation terminates at the expiration of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.874" offset="13315448">But if the contract expressly provides to the contrary, that is a valid and lawful provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.623" offset="13342407">And that has been generally understood as the law for many years and certainly is not changed by the Scott case which did not even involved royalties at all.</text>

            <label>Mr. Elwood Hutcheson</label>
            <text syncTime="3367.765" offset="13471033">Yes, sir, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.526" offset="13478034">I urge the -- the facts of this case, I submit, do not present that clear cut legal question as petitioners contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.363" offset="13517427">So, I am making both contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.563" offset="13534250">In other words, the matter of reduction of royalty was referred to here and it is undisputed that originally these contracts worth for $5 per bale, a few years later and before these contracts with petitioners were entered into which involved the resale of these machines, Thys voluntarily reduced it from $5 to $3.33 per bale, 200-pound bales, $3 they paid by October 15th.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.893" offset="13667474">The $500 minimum royalty remained in the same and Thys testified and it's undisputed that at time, he had two alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.568" offset="13706240">He could have reduced the royalty period and if he had, he might have avoided this question but it was considered for the best interest of the farmers instead of reducing the royalty period, to reduce the royalty rate and let it continue for the same period as before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.403" offset="13789518">Not extending the period but remained -- the period remained in the same by reducing the royalty rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.478" offset="13813864">The advantage to the farmer has been that out of the economies of the machine picking operation they could pay the royalties and that it was to their advantage to have longer time to do so.No interest being charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.829" offset="13879275">And thereby the amount that they would pay each year would be less which was certainly for their benefit and it is undisputed that that perhaps it did actually occur here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.687" offset="13934655">So, here there was no agreement that anyone was not to use an expired patent operation either the petitioners or anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.053" offset="13988153">We have merely an agreement to pay money in a manner and on a basis that was not an excessive financial burden on the hop farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.551" offset="14026188">And these contracts were voluntarily entered into long before any of these patents expired and I submit that they are not against public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.732" offset="14074880">They are lawful and valid and the judgments appealed promptly should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3534.949" offset="14139768">Its with sadness that I inform the Court of the death of the Herbert Hoover, the 31st President of the United States, his services to the country both before and after as well as during his Presidency will leave a mark on history and in your -- to our benefit as well as the benefit of those abroad for a long time to come.</text>
