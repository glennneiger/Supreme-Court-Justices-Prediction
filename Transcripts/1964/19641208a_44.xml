            <text syncTime="27.915" offset="111595">This case presents a review an order of the Subversive Activities Control Board directing the petitioner, the American Committee for Protection of Foreign Born to register as a Communist-front organization in accordance with the provisions of the Subversive Activities Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.349" offset="205322">Such an order has very serious and drastic consequences to any organization to which it is addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.580" offset="238237">In the first place, the order represents and it is accompanied by a governmental -- a governmental determination that the organization to which it is addressed is a subversive organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.536" offset="314096">Secondly, the organization has to acquiesce in that brand of it by the government by registering itself with the Attorney General as a Communist-front organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.055" offset="376163">In addition, it must file a registration statement in which it divulges to the eyes of the public and to the Attorney General with whom it has filed various details concerning its internal affairs including the names of all its dues paying members and all its contributors.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="121.487" offset="485878">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.052" offset="492147">The Communist-action organizations have to list all their members and contributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.840" offset="523285">Communist-front organizations don't have to list all their members but they do have to list all the sources from which they receive their revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.440" offset="561737">And under the regulations of the Attorney General in fact they have a copy of the form right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.607" offset="586397">They have to list the names and address of every person from whom they received a nickel.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.668" offset="606668">And that is why I was careful to say not that they have to list all their members but that they have to list all their dues paying members.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.886" offset="635507">They don't have to list members that don't pay their dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.620" offset="654420">In addition to that, the Act imposes certain sanctions on the organization and on its members which become effective as soon as the registration order becomes effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.217" offset="708859">The organization is required to label its publications, its radio broadcast and any television broadcast as being disseminated by a Communist organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.562" offset="766224">The organization is denied any tax exemptions and contributions to it are not tax deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.812" offset="795167">Employees of the organization are not permitted to be on the social security roles and no government employee and no employee in a defense plan may make any contributions or perform any services for the organization.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="216.506" offset="866011">Are the sanction equivalent for Communist-action organizations?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="221.290" stopTime="724.828">
            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="221.290" offset="885133">There are a few minor differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.537" offset="910106">And I'll -- and those are basic -- those differences are basically with regard to the sanctions on the members rather than on the organization itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.531" offset="950021">These that I have just mentioned, the sanctions on the organization are true of the Communist-action and Communist-front organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.340" offset="977293">So far as the members are concerned, in both front and action organization, the members are denied employment with the Federal Government or with labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.988" offset="1023896">In an action organization, the members can even work in privately owned defense plans or defense facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.522" offset="1053989">In the front organization, they make a nominal distinction in favor of the members of the front.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.209" offset="1080738">Theoretically, they are allowed to work for a defense facility but only if they volunteer to the management and disclose to the management that they are members of the subversive organization, then if the management is still willing to employ them why then they can have such employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.722" offset="1162867">Members of the organization are not elligible to receive scholarships or tuition loans under a federal aid education programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.937" offset="1203722">Members of the organization if they are -- who are aliens cannot be -- cannot be naturalized, they are subject to deportation, and if they were recently naturalized within the preceding five years, they are liable to denaturalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.505" offset="1269969">Now, it's perfectly obvious that the net effect of the brand, the registration, the laws of privacy, and these sanctions is to destroy any organization which like this organization depends on the goodwill of the public, to destroy the right of association in the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.880" offset="1347500">It should destroy the ability of the organization to promote its cause and to attempt to enlist public support.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.200" offset="1380728">Now, why was this done to this organization, and that brings me to the definition of a Communist-front organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.381" offset="1417509">In order to get to that, let me first take up the definition of a Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.711" offset="1442795">That definition in substance is an organization which is substantially controlled by the Soviet Union and which operates to advance the seditious objectives attributed to the World Communist Movement in Section 2 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.649" offset="1522521">And the Communist-action organization meant to refer to the Communist Party and that no one's amazement on April 20th, 1953 the Subversive Activities Control Board found that the Communist Party was the Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.722" offset="1590857">Now, a Communist-front organization has somewhat the same relationship to a Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.156" offset="1628578">In this sense, first of all, there are two components of what constitutes a Communist-front organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.618" offset="1666403">First, the organization has to be substantially controlled by the Communist-action organization, that is by the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.860" offset="1699422">I may say to begin with that this control isn't the kind of enforcible control that you could put your hand on that a master has over a servant, that a parent corporation has over a subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.438" offset="1757727">Control for the purposes of the Act as it was interpreted in the Communist Party case is a kind of psychological disposition to whereby the body that is controlled tends to agree or with the body which controls it because of the source from which the opinion comes rather than on the basis of it's own independent judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.634" offset="1854485">So the first component is -- of a Communist-front organization is that is substantially controlled in this sense by the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.091" offset="1892310">And the second component, which is what I call in my brief the aid component has to do with what the organization does, and it must be and I quote now, “Primarily operated for the purpose of giving aid and support to the Communist Party or to a Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.707" offset="1974753">Now, I would like to take up first the -- what I consider to be the most important issue in this case and that is the Board's construction of the aid component and my contention that first the Board must construe the aid component and secondly if it'sconstruction is right the Act is palpably unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.799" offset="2051135">So far as the control component is concerned and I'll try to get to that if time permits, I have attempted in the briefs to examine the various elements on which the Board based its determination of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.451" offset="2101708">And in my opinion, we stablished that the Board used erroneous standards that it misconstrued the Act in numerous respects and made many evidentiary mistakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.482" offset="2145907">But let me first get to the aid component, in the basis on which the American Committee was held that they primarily operated for the purpose of giving aid and support to the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.697" offset="2206720">Now, the American Committee has been actively in business since 1933 and the first thing that we know is what it does not do that conceivably might constitute giving aid and support to a Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.513" offset="2274011">There is no contention, no suggestion, no evidence and no finding that the American Committee engages or has ever engaged in violence or insurrection or has advocated violence or insurrection.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.426" offset="2325629">In fact, there is no contention that the American Committee has ever attempted to promote any kind of Marx's ideology or any other doctrine seeking fundamental change in society, in our society as distinguished from reforms within the structure of our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.028" offset="2400026">Neither is there any suggestion that the American Committee has at anytime aided the Communist Party organizationally, there is no suggestion and no finding that the American Committee is going out and recruited members for the Communist Party or that it has raised money for the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.568" offset="2478184">This is what the organization does not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.020" offset="2491977">Now, what does it do or what has it done that was held to constitute aiding and supporting the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.724" offset="2522802">Both the Board and the Court found that the American Committee's primary activity and in fact its only activity consisted of a best variety of activities designed to advanced the interest of the Foreign Born in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.771" offset="2587063">There was educational works, service works such as helping people with their naturalization problems, legislative work and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.613" offset="2618410">But the thing that bulks the largest in this case is what is called the American Committee's defense work, and this defense work consists of the defending aliens who are involved in deportation proceedings or naturalized citizens who are involved in the denaturalization proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.423" offset="2705659">In those cases, the American Committee sponsors the litigation if it is asked for a sponsored litigation at all levels and if it is a litigable case from the Immigration Service to and including this Court and there has been numerous cases sponsored by the American Committee in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.093" offset="2784340">It furnishes counsel if the alien doesn't have its own counsel, it pays all expenses of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.557" offset="2818194">And also, it is customary that the American Committee not only defends the individual in the litigation itself but it puts on the public defense forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.294" offset="2849123">That has caused the attention of the public to a sad situation to the action generally considered arbitrary of the Immigration Service, Department of Justice, and so forth.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="739.565" stopTime="741.444">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="739.565" offset="2958211">All kinds of deportation cases?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_forer" startTime="741.444" stopTime="1285.435">
            <label>Mr. Joseph Forer</label>
            <text syncTime="741.444" offset="2965734">Yes, I'm coming to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.520" offset="2973989">The record is clear and it is undisputed that the American Committee defends every alien involved in a deportation case who seeks its help without any conditions, without asking any questions and regardless of the nature of the accusation and the same thing is true of a naturalized citizen faced with a denaturalization case.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.607" offset="3062387">And this stems from the general position of the American Committee that it is opposed to all deportations of resident aliens no matter for what reason and it's opposed to all denaturalizations no matter for what reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.750" offset="3122991">And that policy has been publicly proclaimed that was found by the Court, there's no evidence to the contrary, mountains of evidence in its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.354" offset="3165414">Now, among the cases, which the American Committee has defended and is all-time -- defended at in political cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.030" offset="3204075">As a matter of fact, the very first case that this record shows that the American Committee that we know about, this was a 1935, the American Committee was defending the case of a man by the name of Alfred Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.912" offset="3259559">Alfred Miller was a Jewish refugee from Nazi, Germany and the Immigration and Naturalization Service was trying to deport him back to Nazi, Germany and sure death on an allegation that he has been a member of the Communist Party in Nazi, Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.022" offset="3316088">That's the first political case that we know of that the American Committee was defending.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.965" offset="3335837">But these cases were relatively few and far between among the cases defended by the American Committee until the Cold War started in 1946 when the Department of Justice started a full-scale deportation drive against the alleged members or past members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.455" offset="3425802">They brought these cases by the hundreds and thousands as the record abundantly shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.161" offset="3452552">This drive was not limited to security risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.267" offset="3464986">It was limited to people who are nominal members.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.792" offset="3479092">It included people who are nominal members, it included people who were long time passed members, who had been members of the Communist Party for only a short time, people who are long time residents, who's families were disrupted, often involved a dubious evidence and it also involved some pretty harsh procedures including holding aliens without debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.163" offset="3572611">Now, many of the aliens that got involved in this onslaught were poor, it couldn't afford a counsel, and this is all in the record, others could afford counsel, and they went to their regular lawyers in the 1940s and their lawyers refused to represent them because they were afraid.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.259" offset="3640947">And still others who got counsel and the counsel didn't know anything about the deportation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.187" offset="3668741">And it was natural for them and many of them did it, they go to the only place that was publicly commited to defending anybody involved in a deportation case and that had the ability and the resources and the knowhow of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.224" offset="3736869">And the American Committee litigated as a test case not knowing at the time that this would then be considered evidence against it, the case of Peter Harisiades in which this Court upheld for the first time the constitutionality of the political grounds for deporting past membership in the Communist Party and the American Committee lost that.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.506" offset="3821923">It then managed somewhat later to recoup some of that ground by interpretation by winning the Rowoldt case in which the majority opinion was written by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, and more recently the Gastelum-Quinones case in which a majority opinion was written by Mr. Justice Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.706" offset="3894753">The one witness in the position denote the number of cases, political cases, as compared to other cases handled by the American Committee was Abner Green, the Executive Secretary of the Committee, now dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.877" offset="3955461">And Mr. Green estimated that in a 20-year period, the American Committee has sponsored somewhere between three and 4000 cases of which 350 to 400 were political cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.523" offset="4014080">The Board said -- well, it didn't think the proportion was particularly significant but it thought that the proportion was much larger and it estimated about 50%, it never said on where it based its estimate and there is nothing in the record on which it based its estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.920" offset="4071654">But the fact is that both estimates were the cases in which the accusation was a Communist Party membership and frequently the accusation turned out to be wrong and in which the accusation was not only a present membership but also of past membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.825" offset="4139259">Now, when -- when the American Committee got involved in this case to this extent and in view of the atmosphere, the time at that point, the American Committee stopped being a respectable organization as far as the Government was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.234" offset="4188891">Government officials no longer came to speak on its affairs and it made the Attorney General's list of subversive organizations in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.461" offset="4229747">Now, the Board's theory is that in determining that the meaning of the aid components of what is giving aid and support to the Communist Party, they said it doesn't matter what the organization actually does, it is what they called the motive -- purpose by which they meant motive for what Board does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.748" offset="4310936">And the Board found that the primary motive or primary purpose they call to the American Committee was to defend the members of theCommunist Party in deportation cases and it recognizes that they are always non-Communist cases, but it said that that wasn't inconsistent with its primary motivation, its primary purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.207" offset="4412813">And on that basis, it held that the American Committee satisfied the aid component of a Communist-front definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.103" offset="4448340">Now, I may say that the evidence on which they drew this inference of motive seems to me that the -- well, it just outlandish and I have a whole section of the brief devoted to each bit of evidence from which they drew that inference but I can't get into that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.075" offset="4524199">But that was the theory of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.113" offset="4536424">Now, the Court of Appeals had a somewhat different theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.862" offset="4555442">It didn't talk about motive, it said, “Yes, the major emphasis of the Committee's work was this defense activity” and it said “This -- this defense of every alien that sought its help was a very laudable thing”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.676" offset="4622629">As a matter of fact, many of the cases that the American Committee won, were won in that very court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.429" offset="4645616">It said it was a very laudable thing but this laudable activity constituted aid and support to the Communist Party and therefore made the organization subversive in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.146" offset="4688562">First of all, it said some of the aliens whom it defended were accused of being Communist and some of them those who were so accused actually happened to be Communist, and in so far as the American Committee defended people who were members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.095" offset="4752300">They said, “Obviously, that benefited the Communist Party” and therefore in that respect the American Committee satisfied the aid component by aiding the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.103" offset="4792320">But it said there was a more subtle way in which the American Committee aided the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.757" offset="4814994">It says the American Committee goes around engaging in all these laudable activities having laudable objectives and doing good deeds and it gets a lot of public credit for it and it said that helps the Ameri -- that helps the public image of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.219" offset="4860865">And in that way, in this subtle way, the American Committee helps the Communist Party because the Communist Party gets credit for the good deeds of the American Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.501" offset="4937979">This on the face of it seems to me to be preposterous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.805" offset="4955220">In any event, the Government's brief now repudiates that theory because it is manifestedly inconsistent with the Government's contention that one of the things that distinguishes and makes it necessary to apply the Act to Communist-front organizations is that they hide their connections with the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.376" offset="5033482">Well, if they hide their connections with the Communist Party, it doesn't make any sense to say that the Communist Party gets credit for their good deeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.621" offset="5066397">So that is repudiated by the Government and we come down to the proposition that the sin of the American Committee, the thing that makes the American Committee satisfy the aid component of the Act is that it depends among other aliens, persons who actually are members of the Communist Party.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.620" offset="5286452">Now, what the Board did and what the Government does in its brief, American Committee puts out a 47-page pamphlet written by Abner Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.728" offset="5322815">This pro style, the Board couldn't stand and neither can the Government apparently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.854" offset="5343399">And in this 47-page pamphlet, he theorizes about why do you have these kind of political deportation, it says it's part of the whole atmosphere caused by persecuting Communists in the Smith Act prosecutions and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.477" offset="5397838">So out of the 47-page pamhplet dealing with deportation cases, the Board picks out one sentence in which he says look at the Smith Act and look at the Rosenberg cases, and say, “See the American Committee is the party from this purpose.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.355" offset="5453322">All those things are examined and in my opinion, that's what I meant when I said the outlandish basis on which the Board infered its purpose and I'll go into that in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.395" offset="5501492">The point I am making now is that there is no question on this record and from the findings of the Board and from the findings of the Court of Appeals that the American Committee sin was that it defends Communist in depotation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.838" offset="5559275">Now, I suppose that that sin is compounded because it had so often won some of those cases, of course, aided and defended in that respect by the federal courts, sometimes including this one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1422.390" offset="5689469">And a correct interpretation of the aid component, in the first place, it wouldn't depend on motivation, it would depend on what the organization did and it means that the organization has to be engaged in activities or primarily engaged in activities, which aid in some reasonably direct manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.890" offset="5763553">The supposed illicit objectives, which by definition characterized a Communist-action organization which it supposedly aiding, for example, that it advocates violence or Marx's ideology or it aids the organization -- organizationally by recruiting for it, raising money or something of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.122" offset="5848398">But it does not in our opinion and cannot constitutionally hold activities which are considered laudable and benign if they are done by anybody else on the grounds that somehow these activities might conceivably in some possible indirect way or might be motivated to benefit the Communist Party or to coincide with some clauses that Communist support along with non-Communist.</text>

            <text syncTime="1582.341" offset="6329260">And the Board is a Subversive Activities Control Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.569" offset="6346188">In the Communist Party case, the majority opinion, the Court recognize that there was a restraint on the First Amendment interest of Communist by the registration order involved there but it held that these interests were outbalanced by the fact that the Communist Party supposedly engaged in actually dangerous activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.462" offset="6445767">And it said that the interest of the Communist Party and its members were outbalanced by “The exigency -- the exigencies of sole preservation and the values of liberty” which were menaced by the supposed foreign control criminal conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.569" offset="6514207">Now, we don't have any -- anything like that here or claim here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.954" offset="6531762">It is impossible to see how the exigencies of self-preservation and the values of liberty would be served by depriving aliens of counsel and upheld in cases in which they are proceeded against by the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.391" offset="6605531">Under the holding of the Communist Party case, the Communist Party itself would be required to register even if it was held to satisfy the controlled component, on the grounds that -- if the only activity it participated in was concededly non-dangerous and non-subversive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.438" offset="6693721">For example, if the Communist Party indirectly aided the Soviet Union by furnishing legal aid, the Russian citizens are promoting the Russian ballet in this country, they could not satisfy the requirements that the -- this Court found necessary as applied to Communist-action organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.439" offset="6777731">And yet here, an organization is required to regisrer without any showing of dangerous activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.562" offset="6810227">In the Cramp case, this Court invalidated the Florida oath which made government employees disclaim aid and support to the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.554" offset="6862158">And the Court said, “Well, aid and support of the Communist Party has all kinds of possible absurd -- ” it has absurd possibility, that because of this absurd possibility, the oath is no good, well, it's too vague and well invalidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.654" offset="6922553">And among the absurd possibilities that the Court referred to in Cramp and which later on Mr. Justice White referred to in the Baggett case, a similar oath, was a lawyer who represented the Communist Party or its members or a journalist who defends the constitutional rights of the Communist Party or its members, or anybody who supports any clause which is likewise supported by Communist or the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.599" offset="7022341">And the Court just recoiled from the fact that this should be considered aid and support to the Communist Party but said that because such outrageous things could be considered aid and support to the Communist Party, they would invalidate the oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.813" offset="7083154">Now, in Baggett against Bullitt, Mr. Justice Clark felt that the interpretation was so extravagant that nobody in their right mind could possibly so apply the oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.706" offset="7126727">And he said to anybody who interpreted the oath that way would be like Gulliver's mad scientist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.968" offset="7151804">Now, in this case the -- we don't have a note but we have an Act which can be interpreted and administered by the Board and there's no reason for them to interpret the oath the way Gulliver's mad scientist might have interpreted and I think the legislative history supports the interpretation I proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.079" offset="7232261">At page 45 of my brief, I quote from the house report on the bill and the Committee there said that it found it necessary at the outset to distinguish those features the Communist activity against which legislation cannot and should not be directed from those in the case of which legislative restraints are clearly practicable and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.669" offset="7330586">So the Committee forwarded, it should and that it had to distinguish between benign activities and subversive activities, Communist activities and this -- most such distinction is made by the construction of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.823" offset="7407282">Section 2 (7) of the Act refers to Communist-front organizations as being organizations which are operated -- which Communist-action organization is operated in carrying on the activities refered to in paragraph 2 (6) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.281" offset="7477081">That is Communist-front organizations are used by action organizations to carry on the activities in 2 (6).</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.297" offset="7505084">If you look at 2 (6) these are all conspiratorial, wicked, danger-causing activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.165" offset="7532565">They have nothing to do with representing aliens in deportation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.005" offset="7552000">Now, the Government's theory as far as I can make it out is that you can stop Communists from engaging in protected activities which everybody else could engage in if it would in anyway benefit the Communist Party and since you can't stop the Communist from doing it, therefore you can stop an organization which is controlled by Communist, but it's the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.587" offset="7638309">It seems to me that both parts of it syllogism are wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.070" offset="7652206">According to them, it's alright for Wendell Willkie to represent Mr. Schneiderman in a denaturalization case in this Court because he's not controlled by Communists but it would be improper for Mr. Schneiderman to defend themselves because he himself was a Communist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.732" offset="7714900">Now, since the Dijon case has been established that -- that Communists cannot be restrained from engaging in the First Ammendment activities, peaceful First Amendment activities, just because they are Communists, the point was again made in the Scales case which Mr. Justice Harlan wrote the majority opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.576" offset="7794207">And in the Aptheker case, the past -- recent passport case, this Court again held that Communists can't be restrained from engaging in peaceful activities open everybody else just because they are Communists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.359" offset="7845407">Insofar as this Court has upheld legislation address against Communists, like the Section 9 (h) Taft-Hartley anti-Communist affidavit, it is done so on the theory that the activity that was restrained had a direct connection with danger-causing activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.968" offset="7931820">So even Communists can't be engaged from an -- can't be restrained from engaging in such protected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.202" offset="7960764">And the situation becomes worst when you extend this doctrine that Communists have no constitutional rights the Government is obliged to respect for organizations which are supposed to be controlled by the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.616" offset="8014367">In the first place, this control is a metaphysical concept under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.844" offset="8031295">It's an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.592" offset="8034325">It's not a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.346" offset="8041326">The second place has been cited by adminstrative board not by a judicial body, not by a jury which relies and the Government says it is entitled to rely on hearsay, opinion evidence, remote evidence, speculative inferences and then after all that it's decision is entitled a great weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.014" offset="8116036">The upshot of it is that under the Board's theory, the Act imposes, gives the federal government an unprecedented and virial in power to supervise close organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.456" offset="8165773">No matter how laudable and benign their activities, the Government is now supposed to spy on the organization to determine if they have hidden motivations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2072.243" offset="8288967">This case involves the constitutionality of a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.574" offset="8306207">I want to emphasize that it is limited to the registration provisions with -- it is only the registration provisions which are before the Court and not any of the disabilities either as they apply to the organization or to the members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.157" offset="8368588">These provisions do not prohibit petitioner from doing anything, they do require the Board to make a finding as to the character of the organization and if it finds the organization to be a Communist-front as defined in the Act to require it to disclose its officers and to make a financial accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.129" offset="8460434">In considering the issues in this case, the Government believes that it is crucial to understand the nature of Communist-fronts and their relationship to the World Communist Movement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2133.514" offset="8533995">That was the hold -- that was the holding of this Court in the Communist Party case, that provisions here are almost identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.800" offset="8559177">They certainly are analogous and the relationship between the disabilities or sanctions and the registration provisions is identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.384" offset="8609437">In our brief, in the appendices, we described in considerable length, the nature of Communist-fronts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.436" offset="8641724">I will not go into it in great detail but I think it is important to summarize the nature of these fronts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.830" offset="8675265">After the Soviet Revolution according to Communist theory, it was expected that there would be armed revolutions in all capitalist countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.204" offset="8716748">But this expectation turned out to be incorrect because the workers turned out not to be so eager to overthrow their governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.578" offset="8754260">Therefore, the Communist leaders in the Soviet Union and their theoreticians decided to attempt to win the allegiances to the workers, as well as of other groups more gradually than advocating and solely advocating armed revolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.405" offset="8817580">They did this not so much by changing the views of the Communist Parties which continued to support armed revolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.135" offset="8848509">But rather by infiltrating, and if possible, controlling formally non-Communist organizations in all kinds of different fields, workers, farmers, veterans, ethnic groups, and the like, and if they were unsuccessful in doing this to set up new organizations to perform these tasks.</text>

            <text syncTime="2236.231" offset="8944849">This is the kind of evidence that was before the Congress in enacting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.760" offset="8970971">Now, the Congress found what a Communist-front was and therefore the evidence that was before the Board was just evidence which went to the character of the American Committee itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.347" offset="9025306">In other words, the Board of course has no power to go beneath it and determine anew whether the Communist-fronts are in fact dangerous.</text>

            <text syncTime="2282.590" offset="9130318">It is an organization that does no more than defend people, which of course is perfectly, as he insists, a laudable objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.509" offset="9170024">What we are trying to do, what I', trying to do now is to put these provisions in the context of the Communist Movement, which is what Congress was dealing with in the Internal Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.149" offset="9220493">One scholar has pointed out that with the aid of -- with 100 Communist members, it is possible to control an organization of a 150,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.564" offset="9270230">That Communist control of these organizations was not revealed because if the Communist control was revealed non-Communist would be scared away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.562" offset="9310145">And these organizations utilized popular causes, good causes, higher wages, better working conditions are positioned to fascism and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.513" offset="9349956">But these causes were not the ultimate objective of the Communist Party members who control the organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.105" offset="9376392">Their ultimate objective, which they did not directly advocate within these organizations, was forcible overthrow of the government of a particular country in which they were operating.</text>

            <text syncTime="2397.983" offset="9591850">-- in two different pockets there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.698" offset="9602717">You can propagandize people towards economic measures, to move closer and closer to Communist dogma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.387" offset="9641482">When they get close enough then the person they hope will say, well, really this -- I've been in favor of Communist dogma all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.174" offset="9676696">The whole piece in the long run, the people will either become Communist Party members in this method and this of course does happen or at least that they will consider Communism not a serious menace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.139" offset="9724552">Now, the second reason is that they hoped to get people non-Communists to support positions even though they are not Communist Party members that are taken by the Soviet Union or by the Communist Parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.569" offset="9774184">Now, they did this in their -- in the Soviet Peace Crusade after World War II, they set up various peace organizations throughout the world in order to get as many people to support Soviet views then hopefully the democratic governments would reflect the positions of these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.285" offset="9849104">The number of people in the Communist Party might be very, very much less.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.006" offset="9868016">The third reason is that these Communist-led organizations often provide support to the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.314" offset="9893198">Now, this may be financial, they may take you in a great deal of additional money more than they spent or they may provide services, that's exactly what we allege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.012" offset="9927993">But the Government alleges and what the Government believes that is proved, the American Committee did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.490" offset="9945861">It was the way of the Communist Party defending its members through funds contributed by non-Communist and the non-Communist did not know that the organization they were contributing to was in fact controlled by the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.967" offset="10011794">And fourth, these Communist-led organizations play an important role when and if the time ever comes for armed revolution before -- immediately before revolution, they may join in United Fronts, this was done in the 30's throughout most of Europe and in those United Fronts they try to cause chaos and turmoil and both in the society and in the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.006" offset="10103954">When the revolution actually cursed, they may attempt to make the organization actually back the revolution or else be neutral to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.055" offset="10136137">Now, what I'd been talking about sounds extremely theoretical and unreal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.498" offset="10165917">The appendices to our brief indicate that for some 40 years this is exactly what the Communist Party has been doing this country -- in this country and throughout the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.584" offset="10206250">I think it's fair to say at least they didn't think it was unreal but I think it's fair to say that they thought they were accomplishing something by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.402" offset="10237597">And how much they've accomplished?</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.368" offset="10249404">I suppose they haven't accomplished enough in all the democratic governments that haven't been overthrown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.370" offset="10269466">But the fact is that there are two examples of where this method was extremely important to Communist overthrow of the government and that were within the two coup d'etats in Czechoslovakia and in Hungary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.670" offset="10322651">Unfortunately the Government's brief does not describe the use of the fronts in these two very specific instances in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.681" offset="10354625">But they are described in several books and articles which are cited by Mr. Justice Jackson in his concurring opinion in the Dennis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.143" offset="10388480">And these books and articles by scholars indicate just how Communist-fronts form an extremely vital role in the actual revolution when and if that time ever comes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.157" offset="10444591">Now I'd like to turn more specifically to this statute and how it fits into the pattern of the Communist theory and practice which I've just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.657" offset="10490567">Section 2 (7) -- Section 2 of that Act describes the World Communist Movement in considerable detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.733" offset="10514913">Subsection 7 describes Communist-fronts as being created and maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.460" offset="10549812">In order to obtain financial and other support from people who would not normally give their support to the Communist activities, and Congress found that these fronts conceal their true character and their purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.852" offset="10607386">Now, the Act then defines in Section 3 (4) what a Communist-front is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.131" offset="10628493">And essentially, insofar as it's relevant here, it says that a Communist-front is first controlled by a Communist-action organization, here at the Communist Party and second that it has the purpose of carrying -- of giving aid and support, the primary purpose of giving aid and support to the Communist-action organization, here at the Communist Party.</text>
