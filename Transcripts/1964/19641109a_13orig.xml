            <text syncTime="59.211" offset="236774">This case is before the Court as a controversy between Texas, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Florida over certain intangible obligations which were incurred in the course of business of Sun Oil Company, which of course is a state which is involved in operations throughout all the states or rather, they have permit to do business in all the states and do business in many of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.847" offset="367386">The particular obligations which we are concerned with in this case arose out of the operations of two district offices located in Texas and --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="109.803" offset="439171">To what?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_o_shultz_ii" startTime="111.062" stopTime="895.863">
            <label>Mr. W. O. Shultz II</label>
            <text syncTime="111.062" offset="444186">District or division offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.665" offset="454635">Their home office is in Philadelphia but they maintain throughout the United States certain division offices and the record, according to the stipulation, shows that the two offices in Texas were more or less, autonomous in the scope of their operations there in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.670" offset="542616">They conducted placing agreements, drilling.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.903" offset="555572">They operated for oil and gas in Texas as well as neighboring states.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.150" offset="580545">They contracted for their own labor hiring and firing, and handled their own payroll, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.409" offset="617535">New Jersey is claiming that, as a domiciliary state of the corporation, that it is entitled to take all of these obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.782" offset="671033">Florida contends that, as the state of the last known address, contend for a theory that the last known address should govern as to which state has the power to take possession of these unclaimed obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.054" offset="740206">We, as an alternative to the position which was adopted by the special master which concluded that all of these obligations had a status with the creditor, therefore, only the state wherein the last known address, they had the power to deal with these obligations, well, it seemed to us, in taking this approach, that you ignore many of the equities concerning the transaction out of which these obligations arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.969" offset="899866">And, that you take a rather arbitrary single factor surrounding a particular obligation when you know other circumstances surrounding the same obligation which might enact with the injustice, in fairness to everyone, give some other state a better claim to these intangibles under their state actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.410" offset="993593">We, in addition, feel very strongly about the fact that such a rou√© would allow the accretion, so to speak, of the oil in -- proceeds from oil and gas of the State of Texas and allow them to be trickled out a piece of meal to other states when, under the law of Texas, oil and gas in place is a real estate and, also, that the rights to delay rentals have been considered as a real property right in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.974" offset="1155866">Now, we admit that, under Texas law, once these minerals have been produced and once the delay rentals are due that they're considered to be personal realty.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.720" offset="1202782">But, there are cases which recognize, and I think it's an established principle in the law, that even though you may have personal realty that it may be so connected with the real estate or real property interest that it may be considered immovable by the state within which the property from which is located was derived.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.498" offset="1297972">And, we have approached the problem as to oil and gas proceeds and the delay rentals in Texas from that stand point.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.140" offset="1344470">We cited in our brief, in that respect, the Toledo Society for Crippled Children versus Hickok which does not directly reach that point but, to me, it gives an indication that the Texas Courts would be and are very reluctant to allow the laws of another state to determine title to anything which is very closely related to the realty in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.993" offset="1499951">Now, in that case, there was oil and gas property involved, and the testator residing in Ohio, at his death, by his will, set up trust for his property, the residual part of his property, whereby part of it would go to -- the proceeds from it would go income to his wife and children for 20 years and, thereafter, that the corpus would be divided up among certain charitable organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.294" offset="1649162">Under Ohio law, such a bequest was invalid and it was so held by the Ohio Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.682" offset="1686674">Well, the Society came down to Texas and filed a suit in Texas to declare their interest in the real property in Texas valid under that will.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.781" offset="1739024">If we look a little at the operations of Mr. Hickok, he was in partnership with a Texas oil operator here and they had agreed, shortly before his death, that they would transfer all of their partnership assets which consisted of certain Oil and Gas properties to a corporation and, in turn, receive stock in this corporations for the assets which they transferred the real property they transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.975" offset="1871830">The corporation has been formed at the death of Mr. Hickok, but the actual transfer had not been carried out and his will specifically directed that his executors and administrators go ahead and carry out that provision, which they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.868" offset="1939435">And, actually, the case went off on the theory of whether or not equitable conversion applied in a situation such as this where you have a conflict of laws question determining the validity of title to real estate or the proceeds from real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.722" offset="2010802">The Texas Court held that even though this realty had been directed by the will to be converted into personal realty that, in determining which law, whether Ohio or Texas, applied to determine whether these charitable organizations were to receive the benefits of the trust that the testator intended, the Court held that -- the Texas Supreme Court held that the Doctrine of Equitable Conversion had no place in the rules pertaining to conflicts of law in saying which law of which state applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.538" offset="2174119">And, they applied the law of Texas and upheld the validity of this bequest in the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.860" offset="2207347">In the course of that opinion, the Court stated that the interest in question were personal realty for distribution purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.764" offset="2275056">They were yet immovable for purposes of determining whether the laws of England or Hungry applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.007" offset="2295954">They were talking about a case that they were discussing in there which also determined a question of -- conflict of law question over which law would apply either England where a land had been converted into personal realty and bequeath to some Hungarian persons, or whether the law of Hungary would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.479" offset="2377874">We'd like to take the position that the proceeds of these estates in Texas are so closely connected with the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.110" offset="2420402">As a matter of fact, they are the full enjoinment of these estates.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.470" offset="2437851">An interest in oil and gas, in place, has no value other than the probability or possibility that it will produce and bring income and then becomes valuable, and the enjoinment accrues to the owner when, in fact, there is that deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.365" offset="2517368">It is a piece meal sale, so to speak, or a continuing sale of the real property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.465" offset="2553835">And, we take the position that injustice and inequity and a controversy between states to see whose law shall apply to take possession of these proceeds from this deduction when it has been abandoned or, so to speak, unclaimed by the rightful owner for a period of time should be determined under Texas law because these things are too closely related to the title to Texas land to be determined by the law of another state because it's well recognized that the law of no other state can determine the title to the realty itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.433" offset="2729691">And, for that reason, we urge the Court to declare that the Texas law should apply to all proceeds from the oil and gas production and the delay rentals, even though accrued and even though they are, under Texas law, personal realty.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.264" offset="2796983">But, that they are personal realty of such a nature and so-related to the realty that they have, if you please, presence in the State of Texas only for purposes of determining title.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.013" offset="2868036">The same question was touched upon in Commissioner versus Skaggs in which Mr. Skaggs, being a resident of Texas, he and his wife own real property in California and a question arose over whether the income from this real property in California would be immunity or separate, whether they could return a joint return or whether he had violated his separate property.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.713" offset="3010769">Well, the Court, in that case, even though the marital residence was in Texas, looked to the law of California which characterized those rentals as his separate property and they discussed the problem and (Inaudible) into crops that grow on the land and admit that even thought once the crops are severed they are personal realty but, even so, the title to them should be determined by the law of the state where the land is located rather than to allow the Texas law to characterize them as something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.092" offset="3168340">In this sense, statutes of that nature operate as statutes real not in the sense they are operating on real property but that they are operating on the thing itself rather than the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.589" offset="3234273">And in fact of the presence of the thing itself give this importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.412" offset="3265620">In addition to this phase of our argument in the case, we look upon all of these obligations, of course they are intangible obligations, and the Courts -- various Courts through the years have held that intangibles have a status here and they have a status there for various purposes and, for taxation purposes, generally at the residence of the person to whom they are owned, the creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.602" offset="3418384">But, I don't think that this is an inflexible determination that the courts made.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.935" offset="3443670">Considering all the facts, the facts that the land -- there, you know the man actually is living in a certain state and he is there carrying on business operations, and this is part of his capital with which he works.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.783" offset="3503125">And, that state gives him the protection of its laws in the operation of his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.969" offset="3523814">So, I don't think the sole consideration in those cases, even though they say that the status is with his residence, I think they take in the other factors into consideration in reaching this conclusion, and this --</text>

            <text syncTime="918.235" offset="3672921">I'm just wondering if it wouldn't be more likely to be served then if we did follow the Master in saying that the last known address of the creditor is one who should determine the state in which this escheat could be had because in each one of the states there must be a procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.770" offset="3775007">It might not be more likely to know if the escheat procedure in the state of his last known address than in some other state that might not come in and here is the heirs come in and claim the property rather than to have this escheat to the state or to -- to the state, yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="994.904" offset="3979598">I made up my own mind but I'm just wondering if the vital contact shouldn't be the one where a man's last residence is because when it comes to escheating of a property of a state he might have a better opportunity there where he's more likely to be than in the state from which he moved or never was.</text>

            <label>Mr. W. O. Shultz II</label>
            <text syncTime="1018.970" offset="4075833">Well, I think that is that the fact of his last known address is one of the factors to be considered and weighed with all others, but I don't think it should outweigh all of it because in the mobility of our population today, and it's becoming more mobile every day, persons are within one state for today and they're across the continent the next day and they have moved there because of a better job opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.613" offset="4182413">We have become a very mobile civilization and this is completely outside of the record and the briefs and our experience in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.142" offset="4228493">People have claimed a property which we have taken under our law and they come from even though their last address may have been in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.713" offset="4266841">We get their claim forms from all over California, Florida and in most of those instances, presumably, it's people who had gone there to retire or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.307" offset="4309159">And yet, here, they come back and they ask us for their money and they are not anywhere near their last known address.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.842" offset="4343327">Now, if the last known address is the only thing you know about the transaction then, certainly, that should bear a prime consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.209" offset="4384810">But, where you know these other factors, for instance, back to our Texas situation again, I'll make this as an alternative argument to our prior argument, that, there, all of the transactions concerning production in Texas of oil and gas certainly took place in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.808" offset="4455131">These local offices went out and negotiated the leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.046" offset="4480104">They directed the drilling, the production, the distribution of the proceeds, by way of the orders which were signed, among the owners, splitting up the proceeds.</text>

            <text syncTime="2134.848" offset="8539324">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.449" offset="8557714">In this action, this Court is being called upon for the first time to decide what rule of law should be adopted where there is a conflict between states who seek to take intangibles which have been unclaimed from a corporation incorporated in one state and doing business in many other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.431" offset="8649665">New Jersey commenced an action against the Sun Oil Company in September of 1961 under the New Jersey Custodial Escheat Law and, while that action was pending, in November, Texas enacted an escheat statute and then commenced an action in this Court to restrain the taking by New Jersey of the intangibles from the Sun.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.088" offset="8752274">This brought before the Court the question of which state should take so that the holder of the intangibles will properly be protected in his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.453" offset="8809744">The history of the activity of the states in this field commenced, so far as litigation is concerned, to some degree back in 1923 with the Security Savings Bank versus California where the right of the State of California to take unclaimed bank deposits was sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.078" offset="8884245">And then, we went on into Connecticut Mutual Life versus Moore where unclaimed life insurance funds were held to be taken -- to be subject to custodial taking by the State of New York where the policies had been delivered in New York on the lives of residents of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.060" offset="8952163">And then, we went on to the Standard Oil case where it was held that the state of incorporation could escheat the shares of stock and the dividends payable there under.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.961" offset="8991765">In all of these cases, the question before the Court was the power of the state to take from the holder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.479" offset="9017887">The state reserved the question expressly in at least two of the cases where a claim would be made by another state, and then we had Western Union versus Pennsylvania, which was decided by this Court in 1961, where Pennsylvania sought to escheat unclaimed intangibles held by Western Union, a New York corporation doing business in the State of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.542" offset="9122168">And, there, the Court held that the State of Pennsylvania could not take unless it could protect the holder from double liability, and we look at this case as that is the question before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.316" offset="9181205">How can this Court best protect a holder from double liability?</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.290" offset="9205133">The Master, in his report, suggested a standard of last known address with a right to the state of incorporation to take under a custodial statute where there were not any last known addresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.601" offset="9258318">In the hearing before the Master, New Jersey urged that the Master adopt a standard of state of corporate domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.227" offset="9296875">Now, the reason we urged that was because, in this area which New Jersey has had considerable experience, we find that when you commence an action against the corporation they are compelled to go into their rather ancient records and the facts which might be available to help on a context theory were not readily available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.274" offset="9389035">For example, in this case, some of the claims are 40 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.639" offset="9406485">Some of the claims in value vary from one penny to several hundred dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.499" offset="9437936">The only facts which we could prepare for presentation to the Master were a stipulation of very general facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.142" offset="9476493">We stipulated that there were claims payable by the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.395" offset="9497496">We stipulated that the Southwest division in Texas does have some autonomy in its activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.178" offset="9532709">Of course, we couldn't stipulate that any one of those particular claims resulted from a man who was hired in Texas on such and such a day who worked in Louisiana on such and such a day because those facts are not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.251" offset="9584953">And, that is interesting only because it shows the general picture which a state is confronted with or a holder is confronted with or a Court is confronted with in passing on a question of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.859" offset="9635422">And if you adopt a standard of state of incorporation for taking from the holder, I think that would be the simplest and the most certain and the easiest rule for both the corporation of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.653" offset="9706580">We concede that there may be situations where equity would require that a claim should go to a state other than the state of incorporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.325" offset="9745241">Well, if that is so, the state making such a claim would have to press its claim against the state of incorporation and, if they present a case -- a factual case which comes within the standard which would permit a second state to take from the state of incorporation, then the state of incorporation would have to pay them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.031" offset="9840118">But, at least so far as the holder was concerned, he would be protected from being sued by any other state and we feel that a precedent has been established for this holding in the Standard Oil case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5395.860" offset="21583412">The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania wishes to state its position as being in accord with the opinion rendered by the Special Master and, consequently, no exemptions were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5408.225" offset="21632836">Originally, Pennsylvania is here to the sufficient contact theory based on the fact that the Sun Oil Company had its principal office and place of business in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="5422.630" offset="21690514">But after further consideration of the issues and in the light of the Master's report, we've changed our position and we now advocate that -- the last known residence theory and we join Mr. Oman in his arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5440.737" offset="21762926">We believe that the last known residence theory is the most practical solution of the three theories advanced because, first, it is a simple, fair, and adequate solution to a complex problem that involves the least amount of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5460.033" offset="21840039">Secondly, it considers the owner's right in the property as well as that of the sovereign and by advertising in the jurisdiction where the owner was last seen or lived or was known.</text>

            <text syncTime="5502.772" offset="22010984">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court, we come at last to the custodian of the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="5512.453" offset="22049750">At the outset of this litigation, in which we are a named defendant but have no real interest other than to see a real solution to this problem, we took the position that we could neither admit nor deny the status of the property here sought in Texas or in any other state which was then a party to the proceeding or subsequently became one, but that we would act in accordance with the disposition of the matter as dictated by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5547.202" offset="22188722">The thing that has concerned us, as the case has progressed, is that in considering the complex theory as advanced by the various states we, as the custodian of the property, may become confused as to what we are supposed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5566.550" offset="22266149">It is for this reason that we are somewhat concerned about the theory advanced by the State of Texas because we have visions of our comptroller or treasurer, whoever he may be confronted with hundreds of these transactions every year, having to become an expert in the conflict of laws in order to fill out the various reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="5590.351" offset="22361339">The theory adopted by the Master has the virtue, from our standpoint, of being understandable and easy to follow even though, I must say, that it is not, from our standpoint, the easiest theory which could be adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5607.753" offset="22430929">If we -- if the Court were to adhere to Mr. Kehoe's theory, that means we've got only one state to worry about or if the Court were to adopt the position originally taken by Pennsylvania, and now abandoned, and that is that the state where the principal office of the debtor is concerned, that would also be an easy rule to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.428" offset="22529672">However, except for the caveat of making constitutional lawyers out of companies -- the officials of companies who are in charge of filing out these escheat reports, we reiterate our position that we have no axe to grind.</text>
