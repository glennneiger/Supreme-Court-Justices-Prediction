            <label>Mr. Robert S. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="36.289" offset="145136">If the Court please, Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.944" offset="167706">I am here pinch-heading for Mr. Wilbert McInerney of the Washington Bar whose name is on the schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.824" offset="215249">We were in Mr. McInerney's office at nine o'clock this morning calling a cab and he got word that his wife had died.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.669" offset="254642">He of course left immediately for the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.637" offset="270524">I'm pinch-heading for him and I trust I can cover the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.594" offset="314305">This case arose in Indiana as a result of an automobile accident, I shouldn't say automobile, involving a Greyhound bus being driven by the petitioner here, Robert Schlagenhauf and a tractor trailer, the tractor being owned by the -- one of the respon -- not a respondent, one of the parties Contract Carriers, the trailer being owned by National Lead Comp -- Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.740" offset="474906">It was being driven by McCorkhill.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.443" offset="497685">That accident happened on July 13th, 1962 on Highway 40, some miles west of Indianapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.916" offset="539585">Shortly thereafter, personal injury litigation was filed, as a mater of fact four days or after, and asking for very substantial amounts of money from all of the parties I have named.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.437" offset="609698">In November of 1962, the plaintiffs, Markowitz being her name, filed an amended complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.199" offset="652748">And in that amended complaint, no mention was made of the physical or mental condition of the petitioner Schlagenhauf.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.964" offset="703843">Greyhound filed an amended cross-claim asking that General Motors be made a third party defendant asking judgment on its cross-claim against Contract Carriers, National Lead and General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.776" offset="759014">Contract then filed its answer to the cross-claim of Greyhound.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.890" offset="775523">Again, no mention was ever made of Schlagenhauf's physical or mental condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.970" offset="807811">Later, in a letter to the District Court, Contract Carriers alleged specific acts of negligence on the part of Greyhound saying the defendant the Greyhound Corporation carelessly and negligently employed and caused its driver Robert L. Schlagenhauf to operate the said bus upon a public highway although he said Robert L. Schlagenhauf was not mentally or physically capable of operating the said bus upon a public highway at the time and place when said accident occurred, which fact was known or should have been known to the Greyhound Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.502" offset="981995">The whole question involved in this case is an interpretation of Rule 35, the Rule permitting physical exam and mental examination of a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.097" offset="1060362">Rule 35 of course provides in an action in which the -- the mental or physical condition of a party is in controversy, the Court in which the action is pending may order him to submit to a physical or mental examination by a physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.040" offset="1152104">The order maybe made only on motion for good cause show and upon noticed -- upon notice to the party to be examined and to all other parties and shall specify the time, place, matter of conditions and scope of the examination, and the person or persons by whom it is to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.394" offset="1253564">About this time in the proceedings, a petition was filed in the District Court by Contract Carriers asking that Schlagenhauf submit to physical and mental examinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.718" offset="1338828">Now it has to be remembered that Schlagenhauf is the unwilling dependent driver of the Greyhound bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.941" offset="1375713">I believe both Mr. Kightlinger and I can agree that there has never been an interpretation of the rule as it applies to an unwilling defendant as of this Court before.</text>
