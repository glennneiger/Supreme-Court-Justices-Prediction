            <text syncTime="33.780" offset="135105">The only count that we are concerned with here is the first count which is of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.350" offset="161332">After the complaint -- the indictment was filed, appropriate motions were filed wherein we sought to have the count one dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.542" offset="206158">The other motions that we filed today are the counts of course are not applicable and we sought count one dismissed on the ground that it was brought by the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.502" offset="249940">The contention was by the Government that the filing of the complaint tolled the statute of limitations under Section 6531.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.785" offset="291109">After the motions were overruled they then filed a -- an amended motion when the Greenberg case were decided in the Ninth Circuit and then it was overruled also so the defendant stand enter the plea of nolo contendere to count one of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.939" offset="367700">On the plea of nolo contendere, the Court found the defendant guilty and assessed punishment of two years and to penitentially suspended 20 months after he would have served four months.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.697" offset="410749">The defendant is now out of -- the appellant is now out on -- on bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.929" offset="427677">The real question then that is before this Court is really there's only one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.630" offset="450456">Whether the complaint was sufficient, in other words, whether the complaint was sufficient and whether it was probable cause from which the United States Commissioner could file that the complaint was sufficient in order to toll the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.461" offset="513776">Our position of course is that the complaint was not sufficient that it did not allege sufficient facts, that all it alleged were -- were many conclusions and that it was vague and definite and uncertain and alleged conclusions and all that -- and that it did not give any basis on which the United States Commissioner could make a finding of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.059" offset="604160">And for that reason we contend that the complaint was not valid and therefore the statute of limitations barred the prosecution for 1956.</text>

            <text syncTime="514.994" offset="2059912">For the first time, after we filed our brief, after certiorari was granted and after we filed our brief, the Government raises the question and they contend that a complaint in this case, that the complaint under Section 6531 does not have to allege facts for which a finding of probable cause could be made by the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.257" offset="2153012">This is the first time that this question that that approach was ever taken by the Justice Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.226" offset="2180807">We have searched and we are familiar, I believe, of all the cases that were -- that were argued either appellant cases or District Court cases and we find no time, at no time was that position taken by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.414" offset="2233574">Now, so therefore now in their brief they contend that that it's not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.540" offset="2266070">That the complaint alleged facts from which the Commissioner has to make a finding of probable cause and on the basis of that issue is summon for a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.122" offset="2308389">Now, we contend of course, that the Government is erroneous in that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.366" offset="2337437">We contend that a complaint could only mean that which has historically meant a cmplaint that the most allege facts so -- which are sufficient for which a finding of probable cause can be made and the Government in their own brief that was filed here on page 29, footnote 15, they alleged that the complaint was tailored, in other words, it's a form.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.443" offset="2441718">And they said that the form was -- was corrected and so modified in order to comply with this Court's decision on the Giordenello case.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.522" offset="2482051">In other words, so they admit even in their brief here that -- that the complaint was so modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.642" offset="2514547">It's a form that they used.</text>

            <text syncTime="694.263" offset="2777025">I think that we have to look at it on what that Congress intend to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.151" offset="2792594">That's really the real question.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.854" offset="2799386">How could we concede that Congress intended to -- if they just wanted to extend the statute of limitations without a showing of probable cause at all that all they would have done is given the Justice Department an additional nine months within which to file -- within which to file a proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.471" offset="2869812">Now, they didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.574" offset="2874201">They said that the statute can be tolled for nine months only if a complaint is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.409" offset="2897607">Now, you have to take the word complaint at its historical sense and in the sense in which it is interpreted in the light of Rules 3 and 4 of the federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.064" offset="2944209">And when you take that and a complaint means that there must be sufficient facts alleged on which probable cause can be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.201" offset="2972735">If not why a Commissioner -- why a United States Commissioner at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="746.716" offset="2986841">Is he just going to be a rubber stamp or is he going to perform the duties that this Court laid down in the Giordenello case as to what a Commissioner or a magistrate has to do in order -- in order to make a finding before they can issue a warrant for the arrest or a summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.181" offset="3052669">Now, we contend further that the Government states here that the reason for the extra nine months is not to give them a chance to make further investigations but because income tax cases are complicated and that often the Government, the defendant wants conferences before the Justice Department and -- or deprived to the Justice Department before the chief counsel of the bureau and the appellant's actions therefore they -- additional and sometimes the jury is not in session and therefore additional time is given to Government within which to com -- within which to process their case in order to give them a chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.738" offset="3230929">But they do not at anytime contend that the additional time was given in order to make further investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.062" offset="3256216">Now, if that is so, how could the Government be heard?</text>
            <text syncTime="817.759" offset="3270949">Why -- then there was a real intent and purpose than it was hat they should have their case ready and they should be able to allege sufficient facts from which probable cause could be -- could be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.746" offset="3318909">The Government further contends in their -- in their brief that well after all you treat a tax case different than you treat any other case because in a tax case the agent themselves first makes the investigation then he writes a report and this is all extraneous by the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.824" offset="3395291">But that's not -- but they'd still perfectly wanted to argue that point because there it is in their brief that the agent makes a report to the -- to his superior and the superior makes a report to the chief counsel and the chief counsel to the Justice Department and the Justice Department passes on it then send it to the United States District Judge Attorney, the United States Attorney then the United States Attorney presents it to the -- presents it to the grand jury for indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.556" offset="3494139">All that that be that as it may.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.032" offset="3504065">The fact still remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.156" offset="3512529">If Congress wanted, the Justice Department to make a determination all they could have said that the Justice Department by a letter by any other indication could say, we want an additional nine months.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.886" offset="3563520">Or that they're taking additional nine months.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.817" offset="3571252">The fact remains that Congress did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.349" offset="3581388">That Congress provided that the only way you could toll the running of the statute is by filing a complaint with the Commissioner and having said so, a complaint has its historic meaning and it must be interpreted within the rules of three and four of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and you must show probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.727" offset="3658815">Now, the question then would also be this if -- if it was done -- if it was done any other way then there would be really no useless purpose and nothing would be performed by the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.692" offset="3722762">And there would even be a question how he could issue a summons which he did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.940" offset="3739690">Now, what basis would he issue a summons if he could not make a finding of probable cause?</text>
            <text syncTime="939.569" offset="3758184">The fact remains that all the adjudicated cases and all the treatment by the Justice Department considered that there must be a probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.954" offset="3791726">Now, we contend that this -- this affidavit is just a form of affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.147" offset="3812519">This complaint rather which is I gather with an affidavit is a -- is a form which was used and is used in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.254" offset="3845016">And it is filled in.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.681" offset="3850658">And if you -- if you take -- if you examine, it is it fielded all of the information that it contains as far as filling in by the agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.753" offset="3898932">The blanks that were filled in were gotten or could have been gotten from the tax return of the appellant that cites one figure and that one figure is the amount of the income he should have reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.963" offset="3947833">And it is well to keep in mind that the amount of the income that a person should have been reported that it is alleged in an indictment is not binding on the Government at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.737" offset="3994854">In other words, it's not well-established, that the Government does not have to prove in an income tax case the exact amount of the charge of the deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.709" offset="4038740">They do not have to or they are not bound by their allegation or contention of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.739" offset="4058906">All they have to show is a substantial understatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.437" offset="4069669">So really that figure could be any figure because it does not need any facts to substantiate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.079" offset="4092238">And that really what the complaint shows that there are no facts alleged at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.114" offset="4108434">Not a single fact is alleged in there to show as to what the -- what the -- what the -- on which the Commissioner could make a finding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1076.026" offset="4304039">It would be perhaps there would be a way to -- to conceive of a form that would fit all purposes whether if you use a form, whether a person the agent that makes the complaint, that files the complaint must make those allegations on personal knowledge on something that he did and then frankly it is difficult to conceive a form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.044" offset="4392124">For instance if here the form says that he talked -- he talked to people that had business with the appellant that he examined books and records of businesses of the appellant, that he examined public records and private records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.079" offset="4448235">But they're silent completely to say where he sold those records, what the records say, what facts were contained in those records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.945" offset="4479687">What basis he is using for to conceive that the records are fraudulent than they are.</text>

            <text syncTime="1131.726" offset="4526811">But here an agent is just signing a form, and it was quite obvious from the time that we examined them at the -- in support of the motion that he hardly read the form.</text>

            <text syncTime="1565.931" offset="6263641">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.663" offset="6282553">Section 6531 of the Internal Revenue Code prescribes a six-year statute of limitations for the criminal offense of tax of willful tax evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.183" offset="6324663">But it authorizes an extension of that six-year period if, “A complaint it instituted before a Commissioner of the United States during the six years.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.487" offset="6369907">The only serious question before this Court now as petitioners conceded is, what the meaning of those words is notwithstanding references to the Fourth Amendment in petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.027" offset="6432078">There's obviously no constitutional issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.006" offset="6443990">Petitioner was not arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.816" offset="6451200">He was not subjected to a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.461" offset="6461753">The only question here is where the petitioner's right of repose which was conferred by a statute as by Congress could -- could be interrupted by a complaint of the sort which was filed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.797" offset="6531135">If for example, the statute rather than providing for a complaint to be filed, had just provided that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue send a letter to any taxpayer whose statute of limitations he would extend, that statute would clearly be constitutional and petitioners conceded as much here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.001" offset="6603964">The only basis for arguing that there's any requirement or probable cause or any requirement of convincing a Commissioner that there's probable cause to believe a perspective defendant guilty is that the statute has used the word “complaint” and that is if you talk about it in terms of its being instituted before a Commissioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1723.741" offset="6894864">And we think the reason that Congress provided for a complaint before a Commissioner is that it wanted the Government to be put to the burden of filing a sworn accusation against the defendant before it would be entitled to extend the statutory period but nothing more than just an accusation under oath.</text>

            <text syncTime="2606.592" offset="10426305">It has much more certainly because the case has been reviewed and rereviewed in the Department of Justice and in the Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.817" offset="10459220">A Commissioner may mistakenly say, “Well, this is sufficient,” as the Commissioner did in this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.558" offset="10478132">And then if a court at a later date concludes that it's not then there's absolutely no way of repairing the damage that the injury done in the Government is far greater in this case than it is in a search and seizure or arrest case where the only things that are excluded are the fruit of any unconstitutional arrest or any unconstitutional search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.610" offset="10562351">Here we have a complaint as to -- as to a proceeding which doesn't involve in anyway, any questions of constitutional dimensions and nonetheless if as it turns out a Commissioner was wrong and the Government was wrong on the question of probable cause which this Court just last week in Ventresca said raised some difficult problems in particular cases then the defendant is entirely immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.386" offset="10669453">His limitations period has expired and he can say, “Well no matter what other evidence you had back there, it's too late for you now to assert it in order to extend the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2882.240" offset="11528882">Here, all that's involved is the right of repose which the Congress has granted by statute.</text>
