            <text syncTime="28.670" offset="114625">In this particular case, the examining trial testimony was adduced at the trial upon in which the petitioner was convicted.</text>

            <text syncTime="94.702" offset="378776">And nine days later, an examining trial was held pursuant to the statutes of Texas to -- at which time, the complaining witness, the manager of the drive-in grocery store, testified and identified the petitioner as the party who had committed the robbery and his testimony also gave out all the necessary elements of the offense of robbery by assault under Texas law.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.830" offset="515239">The petitioner at the examining trial was not represented by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.251" offset="536973">He was not advised that he had a right to counsel, and he did not ask for a contingence to secure counsel nor was counsel offered to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="158.624" offset="634462">The State had utilized no diligence in obtaining the witness present for the trial but instead introduced in evidence the examining trial testimony which had been adduced when he did not have counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.192" offset="1024731">And the Court of Criminal Appeals in discussing White versus Maryland said that in this particular case that it was not a critical stage in as much as the examining trials in Texas is for the reason -- for the purpose of determining whether an accused is to be remanded to jail, admitted to bail, or discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.823" offset="1139252">And they attempted to distinguish White versus Maryland and so stated that the examining trial at the preliminary hearing as it is called in Maryland, in that case, was critical because the accused in the Court of Criminal Appeals speaking was forced to enter a plea, which we submit that the -- under the provisions of Maryland law, the examining trial in Maryland, at the preliminary hearing in Maryland, is exactly the same as the procedure in Texas because at White versus State of Maryland, the Maryland Court of Appeals on page 882 of 177 Atlantic Reporter 2d is approximately the same language that was -- that our Court of Criminal Appeals used.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.111" offset="1380415">They say that there was no requirement, nor any practical possibility under our present criminal procedure to appoint counsel for appellant at the preliminary hearing before the magistrate, nor was it necessary for appellant to enter a plea at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.904" offset="1439556">Certainly, it was under Maryland procedure that it was necessary at the arraignment and he did enter a plea of not guilty at the arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.300" offset="1477172">But having entered a plea at the preliminary hearing of guilty that was later used in evidence against him at the trial in which he was convicted and this Court held that that was a critical stage in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.428" offset="1537672">The State -- the respondents seems to say in their brief that there's no denial of due process for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.964" offset="1579781">One, that the taking the position of the Court of Criminal Appeals did at the examining trial was not a critical stage because it was for the limited purpose of determining whether that he should be admitted to bail or remanded to jail or freed.</text>

            <text syncTime="846.087" offset="3384320">This, as counsel has explained to the Court, was a robbery by assault case wherein the defendant was apprehended a -- a couple of blocks from the scene of the crime, the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.259" offset="3452970">The date of the offense was June 16, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.242" offset="3476898">Now, from the day of the arrest, there were nine days that expired -- from the date of the arrest to the day of the examining trial, what is known in Texas as examining trial is a preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.593" offset="3534367">At that time, Kenneth Phillips, who was the person who was robbed, testified and identified the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.406" offset="3577522">There was also some other testimony in there but at that time, there was a positive identification, alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.760" offset="3610958">The defendant, Pointer, did not have a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.470" offset="3629871">There is no provision in Texas for the appointment of lawyers at the examining trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.393" offset="3653486">In -- at the examining trial in Texas, no pleadings have to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.698" offset="3674697">He doesn't have to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.175" offset="3688699">There is absolutely nothing that he has to do but just sit there and listen.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.064" offset="3708238">The magistrate will determine whether or not there is probable cause to binding it over to the grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="937.786" offset="3751079">But there is a -- the statute does not say that the State has to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.294" offset="3773127">In the event that the State does not choose to be present, then the magistrate inquires into the facts to determine whether or not to set bail, discharge him, or send him to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.940" offset="3839687">I need to point out this -- that after the man was indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.945" offset="3867690">The case was originally set for trial on August 14, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.329" offset="3885244">At that time, on motion of the defendant, the case was -- was passed to give him an opportunity to obtain counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.063" offset="3916173">Now, at this time, he had never asked for counsel up to this time and the Court was never appraised of the fact that he might be a pauper or he might not be a pauper.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.340" offset="3953267">The case was passed from August 14th to September the 17th.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.384" offset="3965492">At that time, once again, the case was called for trial and the defendant announced that he was not ready.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.119" offset="3988376">He needed more time to get another lawyer -- a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.452" offset="4005721">So once again, the -- the Court passed the case but at that time, the Court decided, “Well, I am going to appoint you a lawyer by the name of -- of Charles W. Gill, just in case you don't have a lawyer the next time the case comes -- comes to trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.040" offset="4076147">Alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.294" offset="4089104">On November 6th, the case was called to trial, the third time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.948" offset="4111778">It had five months that expired from the time of the arrest to the time that the case finally went to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.577" offset="4142289">At that time, the Court asked for the announcement of whether the defendant was ready or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.536" offset="4170083">He said he still didn't have a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.183" offset="4184712">But his family had been trying to get Mr. C. C. Divine of Houston to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.832" offset="4211252">Well, there was some discussion about the employment of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.697" offset="4230687">Finally, the Court just decided to go ahead and proceed with the case and appoint C. C. Divine to assist Mr. Gill to represent the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.722" offset="4270811">Nowhere did the defendant ever claim to be pauper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.405" offset="4285544">As a matter of fact, there is testimony in the record that he was acquainted with at least four lawyers in Houston, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.764" offset="4323056">He had paid one Sam Hoover and that's in the record, a sum of about $600 to represent him in another case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.333" offset="4357329">He had called on one John Cutler to represent him in another case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2157.355" offset="8629394">I agree with the Chief Justice that this was the critical area, but Mr. Pena has indicated in his brief and by argument here before the Court a third issue as -- and that would be what I recall waiver by estoppel that his conduct immediately prior to the trial in which he was convicted should be implied that -- that he had waived counsel back at the examining trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.951" offset="8755722">Certainly, the opinions of this Court among which are Carnley versus Cochran, Gibbs versus Burke, Johnson versus Zerbst, Rice versus Olsen, and Uveges versus Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, all indicate that waiver must be knowingly and understandingly made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.908" offset="8831582">And in Rice versus Olsen the Supreme Court of Nebraska implied waiver from a plea of guilty and this Court held that you cannot imply a waiver by conditions subsequent such as a plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.835" offset="8899291">And I feel that the same thing here if you call this waiver by estoppel because of his conduct later on that he still was not advised of his right to counsel and he did not understandingly and knowingly waived counsel at the examining trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.537" offset="8966060">And this is a critical area and we feel that it should be reversed.</text>
