            <label>Mr. Leon Hubert Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="14.387" offset="57469">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.219" offset="80875">This is an appeal under 28 U.S.C. 1253, from a judgment of a three-judge court denying the appellant's application for an injunction to strain the enforcement of three acts of the State of Louisiana contained in the -- our criminal code, Title XIV, Sections 358 through 374, 384 through 385 and 390 and the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.505" offset="201979">All of these statutes on their face purport to deal with regulations of the Communist or subversive parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.713" offset="242834">The three-judge court in the procedure which I will elaborate on in a minute decided against us with the vigorous dissent by Judge Wisdom and that we appeal in this Court nor the jurisdiction on June the 15th, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.666" offset="318589">Now, before going into the actual procedure, I would like to say who the appellants are.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.973" offset="339801">One of the appellants is Mr. Dombrowski who's the president of the Southern Conference Educational Fund, a Tennessee Corporation whose purpose is dedicated to anti-segregation or rather in favor of integration movements.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.936" offset="399673">Mr. Ben Smith an attorney at law and member of this Court who was actively engaged in the south and particularly in New Orleans area and civil rights cases, and then particularly in integration cases that is to say in anti-segregation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.452" offset="461740">He also happens to be treasurer of the organization, Southern Conference Educational Fund which I referred to if it please the Court, as SCEF from now on out.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.073" offset="504268">And Mr. Bruce Waltzer who is a partner, a law partner of Mr. Ben Smith and is also engaged in a practice that specializes anti-segregation matters.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leon Hubert Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="142.634" offset="570514">The 7th (Voice Overlap) -- no sir, not as such but it has the same purposes according to his charter and according to the statement of facts alleged in the petition filed here, filed in the local court.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.182" offset="624640">Now, in 1954, just after the decision of Brown in this Court, Louisiana created a joint legislative committee and also passed the first act which has to do with alleged anti-segregation or rather alleged Communist activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.835" offset="707291">It required then solely that the Communist Party and Communist-front organizations which are defined in the statute should register and that was all that was done at that time it made a penalty for the members of those organizations and for the organizations themselves to fail to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.979" offset="783882">Then in 1962, the legislature created a Joint Committee on Un-American Activities and at the same time it passed the legislation which is actually before this Court now which is a combination actually of the earlier statutes and I will have the occasion in a moment to analyze those various statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.416" offset="877610">Now, before going into the pleading aspect and all the issues that are brought before this Court, I think it would be well for me to state certain facts which however are part of the record and therefore officially before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.753" offset="931004">As I've said, Mr. Smith and Mr. Waltzer, my clients, and Mr. Kinoy by the way, represent Mr. Dombrowski and we'll share the -- our argument that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.649" offset="982518">Mr. Smith and Mr. Waltzer have been engaged in anti-segregation activities in the New Orleans area and all over the south for several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.635" offset="1022537">And on October 2nd of 1963, the appellees, Pfister who was chairman of the Un-American Activities Committee of Louisiana legislature, Rogers who is the attorney follow that committee, Burbank and Willie, all of them were defendants in this case who were police officers of the state police department, and the governor of the State of Louisiana and the Attorney General and the District Attorney of Orleans Parish, all made defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.661" offset="1138625">But Pfister and Rogers and Burbank and Willie got a search warrant from a judge in Orleans Parish and using that search warrant and also a warrant of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.777" offset="1183033">They searched the offices, the homes and the automobiles of my clients and also of Mr. Dombrowski with arms in downtown New Orleans at 3 o'clock on a Friday afternoon and hold off from their offices a great deal of the material including private litigants files which in fact have never been recovered to this day.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.933" offset="1287732">Now, the search warrants were based upon the statutes involved and the warrant of arrest were based upon the statutes before this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.826" offset="1323259">And when they were booked following the arrest at the police station, the statutes before this Court today were used for booking purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.871" offset="1371429">However, after this arrest and our client was able to get out on bond very shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.758" offset="1394939">After this arrest, no formal charges were brought against our clients.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="354.480" offset="1417822">Is this the preference of the attorney?</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="360.134" offset="1440496">Well, it was a proceeding brought to suppress it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leon_hubert_jr" startTime="363.010" stopTime="543.071">
            <label>Mr. Leon Hubert Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="363.010" offset="1451990">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.578" offset="1454289">The proceeding was brought to suppress it and it was ordered to suppress as a matter of fact but that is on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.765" offset="1474978">However, that comes in another proceeding because that's not in this proceeding yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.589" offset="1490338">I will -- I will explain that in -- in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.375" offset="1501414">No formal charges were filed, however, and as a result of that, we filed an application for preliminary hearing which is permissible under the Louisiana law and the judge dismissed all of the arrests but did not turn loose the evidence at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.897" offset="1571527">So that after November 26 then there was nothing pending except that the material seized during the search was still in the custody of the committee of which Mr. Pfister was then a chairman and of which Mr. Rogers was the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.661" offset="1630563">On November the 8th, 1963 however, Mr. Pfister held a committee meeting in Baton Rouge in which he took selected portions of the material seized, placed them in the record which the state has made part of this case by its Exhibit C attached to its brief which is a report of November 8th, over the activities of November 8, report number 4 as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.780" offset="1727112">And he also announced at that time that he was going to call upon the District Attorney of the Parish of Orleans as of November the 8th to institute prosecutions and he was going to turnover this material to the District Attorney of Orleans or at least make it available to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.196" offset="1800777">Well, on November the 12th, Mr. Dombrowski alone at that time, fearful that the statutes would be used against him, however, filed a petition asking for a three-judge court in the Federal District Court in Orleans Parish and it was convened, Judge Ellis, Judge West and a Circuit Judge, Judge John Minor Wisdom, composed the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.269" offset="1889071">At that time, that was, say on November the 12th Mr. Dombrowski did not ask for a restraining order but asked if the statutes be declared unconstitutional as for declaratory judgment also and asked if the statutes were not unconstitutional upon their face that leads the procedures involved that the administrative manner of handling and enforcing the statutes should be declared to be improper and unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.343" offset="1997322">And that was done on November the 12th.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.490" offset="2005891">However, on November the 15th, the judge who was then in charged of the grand jury in New Orleans convened the grand jury as these statutes required them to do and charge them with respect to their duty -- with respect to the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.400" offset="2065554">That is to say that they should look into the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.265" offset="2077048">That happened on a Friday, November the 15th of 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.932" offset="2099722">So then on Monday, November the 18th of 1963, Mr. Dombrowski asked for a temporary restraining order which was granted and which had the effect that goes of halting any prosecution at least at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="749.243" offset="2996872">Well, the indictments for failing to register and for also becoming and remaining and participating in subversive organizations and of course I will get to the analysis to the statutes in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.255" offset="3049012">I might pause for a moment to state what happened next.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.065" offset="3064163">On December the 4th, the District Attorney Garrison of New Orleans filed his answer to the plea -- to the petition for injunction and it's interesting to note that in paragraph 2 of his petition which is at page 13 of the transcript, he states that SCEF, the organization which we have charged with belonging to and being a member of the registry is a subversive organization and that I think becomes important in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.664" offset="3190596">In any case on December the 9th, Smith and Waltzer, my clients, fearing also that they were going to be prosecuted under these acts, intervened in the lawsuit which was then pending between Dombrowski and the other defendants and this intervention was allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.285" offset="3269068">On December the 9th, there was an argument which was restricted at the time by the court to the validity of the statutes on its face, on their face.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.736" offset="3302922">Then at the end of that hearing, the court by two to one without a written opinion at that time stated that they thought that the statutes were valid on their face.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.610" offset="3350361">But that they plead a minute at that time the question of whether the administration of those statutes violated any constitutional provision and set an argument for that on January 10th of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.209" offset="3400829">Now, I might say that the arguments concerning the validity of the statutes are the same arguments that we make here today so that they were properly raised in the lower court and that is to say the First Amendment's right and violates the Fifth Amendment rights and also the preemption of supersession doctrine under the Nelson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.323" offset="3481287">Well, on January 10th when the matter came for a hearing, the court decided that the statutes were valid but that it was not going to hear or it was not going to hear any evidence at all with respect to the administration of the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.092" offset="3544294">The court did allow, however, an offer of proof to be made and that offer of proof is of course contained in our brief and in -- in fact in the facts which the lower court or in the -- in our brief, it's -- repeat the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.478" offset="3601868">No, it's on the transcript, they're regularly on.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.747" offset="3614929">They accept the facts as alleged by us which on in itself makes up we think the cause of action because we alleged in our petition and it's admitted that this organization, SCEF is mainly engaged and solely engaged in fact in anti-segregation activities and that we have been harassed individually and as an organization because of those activities in New Orleans and in the whole southern area.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.998" offset="3743974">The fact that those facts are admitted is also a matter of procedure and that the answer of all of the defendants except Mr. Garrison was plead to the jurisdiction and also a motion to dismiss for a failure to state the cause of action which of course has to admit the truth of the facts that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.656" offset="3822550">Now, when the opinions -- when January 10th came and the court then denied as relief of any sought and denied a stay order, the State prosecuted the three defendants and I think it's worthy for a moment see what prosecutions were about although I mentioned it just a moment ago, these prosecutions occurred on the 22nd and 25th of January.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.529" offset="3910113">So that was just a short period of time that elapsed actually before the indictments came out.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.072" offset="3936235">Mr. Dombrowski was indicted for being a member, the president of a subversive organization to which SCEF which it says, was not itself cited by the Board such as the Attorney General or the U.S. Control Board or any subcommittee or Committee of the House of Representatives but it was the same as another committee which is not perfect here except that it draw some light upon how the statute is being administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.206" offset="4064758">In any case, the second count in the indictment against Dombrowski was for failure to register as a member of SCEF when they're part of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.048" offset="4108121">Now, as to Smith, he was indicted in the same way except that he was indicted count as to him that he was a member of the National Lawyers Guild, an organization that has been cited by the subcommittee of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.051" offset="4160157">And as to Waltzer, the indictment as to him is simply that he is a member of the National Lawyers Guild because he has no -- he did not -- he was not a me -- member or an officer at least of SCEF.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.829" offset="4215223">Now, may it please the Court, I should like at this moment to analyze the statutes that are involved here because we are asking this Court as we did in the court below and declare that those statutes of unconstitutional on their face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.668" offset="4270602">We invoke Baggett versus Bullitt which was decided by this Court last June.</text>

            <text syncTime="1209.510" offset="4837982">The statutes that contained in Appendix A of our brief which is the white brief, and the -- the first statute, the preamble, identifies the organization, the Communist Movement in such language as to indicate that it condemns any organization whose purpose is to overthrow by revolution, force or violence the organization of the State of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.961" offset="4963788">The definitions are contained in Section 359 and the important ones of course are Communist-front organization which is in Section 3 of 359 and Section 5 of 359 which is subversive organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.814" offset="5027213">Now, of course the penal parts, the things that really reach us and that is because those are the ones that use the language which have been condemned in Bullitt versus Baggett as being too vague to these statutes or to stand up against the test of free speech in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.624" offset="5106416">As a matter of fact, the pitch of our argument is that in Louisiana today, even a lawyer has to run this risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.480" offset="5145913">He can remain still and that's really the only safe thing for him to do or he can take a chance and he can take a chance of having to rebut a presumption which is created by Section 3 in defining a Communist-front organization and we have been indicted for belonging to the Communist-front organization or the state says that “Well, it's easy enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="1402.867" offset="5611416">There was such a word as subversive, such a word as counsel, aid and if that such word as knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.418" offset="5641613">I think Mr. Justice White asked, “What knowledge must a man have?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.623" offset="5658436">What must he anticipate or he can do or in other words, there is a matter here that the words themselves even the lawyers, what is subversive?</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.852" offset="5707337">You see, it defined here as a threat to overthrow by a revolution or anyone who teaches or advocates, abets, advices, the overthrow by revolution, force, violence or unlawful means, that was dealt with too in Bullitt versus Baggett because there this Court said that revolution -- peaceful revolution is not prohibited and that any statute which leave some doubt as to whether peaceful revolution change as it were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.999" offset="5827918">The advocacy of peaceful change, of peaceful constitutional amendments of a radical nature could even be forbidden under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.819" offset="5867207">We think the same words are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.556" offset="5874207">We think the same philosophy is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.413" offset="5889567">We think that the same distinctions which the Bullitt case made as to other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.498" offset="5913913">Thus, the Gerende case was distinguished by Mr. Justice White and also the Dennis case was distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.749" offset="5942962">It seems to me that those distinctions apply here too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.117" offset="5964382">Furthermore, there is involved the question of association that is prohibited in violation of Aptheker which was decided last June.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.356" offset="6001371">There is the question of self-incrimination because this statute requires that you register and when you register, you're saying that you're a member of a subversive organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.322" offset="6041287">And when you say you're a member of a subversive organization, you are confessing to a crime of felony punishable by six years in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.954" offset="6075768">We say also that the presumption itself is irrational and that there is no -- there is not sufficient connection between the -- our organization and the Communist or Communist-front organizations that are involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1554.262" offset="6217038">This is the Attorney General of Louisiana who is stating what he thinks has happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.816" offset="6239190">What he thinks our clients have done and what he thinks the statute does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.506" offset="6261969">It says, legislative inquiry in Louisiana is led to a determination that appellants are in fact operating a Communist-front organization which is clearly within the provisions of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.597" offset="6314318">Therefore, when the state tells you that being a member of a Communist-front organization is not a violation of the statute, that's contrary to their own analysis and understanding of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.953" offset="6367713">Furthermore, to go on, Congress and legislative investigation to this organization both before and after the action had come to the conclusion that these were pure Communist functions that the -- our plans were doing purely Communistic things “such as defending the 12 Communist convicted under the Smith Act petitioning for clemency -- well, Communist, and open cooperation with several well other identified Communist-front organizations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.361" offset="6481398">So there's no doubt about it that so far as the Attorney General is concerned, these statutes are subversive statutes that is to say that -- that SCEF is a subversive organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.023" offset="6528000">As a matter of fact, we've been indicted for it as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.173" offset="6544614">The point we make, therefore, is that we have been indicted on the statutes which fall within the scope and breadth and ambit of Baggett versus Bullitt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.622" offset="6586410">We've seen no distinctions between the two and we respectfully ask the Court that the constitutional grounds of free speech, freedom from arrest and the due process aspects are identical in both cases, and that analysis of the statutes, the application of the statutes and particular the fact of being actually indicted would show that the statutes do suppress free speech, free association, free trial, all of which have been upheld by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.306" offset="6717127">And actually, the fact of the matter is as I have said earlier that I respectfully suggest that a lawyer in Louisiana, and were lawyers to as to run a terrible risk even to defend clients, and that's the very best way to get at organizations that you wish to suppress for duty purposes is to get at the lawyers who represent these men, because there, the freedom of speech is of a specialized thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.599" offset="6842305">If an organization cannot have a lawyer who can speak freely, I suggest to the Court that that is more of a violation of the free speech and if it was simply an individual as something about that that is insidious even more than a plain suppression of speech by an ordinary individual getting at the person who can possibly -- and the only person who can possibly represent you if you wish to urge civil rights in Louisiana, getting a lawyer is the very best way to get at the organization and we suggest respectfully that the cases fall within the full ambit of Bullitt versus Baggett.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.723" offset="7030805">Mr. Wisdom -- Judge Wisdom thought so and what I considered to be a brilliant dissent which I'm sure the Court will take into account which he argued all of these points more reluctantly, I will assure you that I have been able to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1799.154" offset="7196526">I think it would be important to point out to the Court that the Washington statute involved in Baggett is in essence the same statute, paragraph by paragraph, word for word with the Louisiana statutes here involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1819.102" offset="7276356">No pending criminal prosecution but I would suggest to the question of Mr. Justice Goldberg and yourself, Justice Harlan, that Baggett also gives us the answer to the conceptual problem of abstention and power of this Court because Baggett says that the vice in these statutes, the vice in this statute, the essence of the vice is the deterrent effect upon the immediate exercise of First Amendment rights which an unconstitutionally broad and vague statute creates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.211" offset="7412820">Now, abstention which is as Judge Wisdom points out, one finds it rather difficult to figure out exactly what the rationale of the majority of the District Court was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.539" offset="7458064">But as Judge Wisdom points out, it was probably a visceral reaction of some sort that to grant relief at this point would impinge upon state's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.477" offset="7497874">But Justice White in Baggett dealt squarely with that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.102" offset="7516369">Because there, the problem of abstention was also involved, strongly argued and ruled upon by the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.099" offset="7540297">And there, in meeting the problem of abstention, Justice White for the Court last June said that there is no question of the duty of a Federal District Court to abstain from litigating the fundamental constitutional issue involved where the challenge is to unconstitutional vagueness in the area of the First Amendment which creates an immediate deterrents to the exercise of First Amendment rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1942.204" offset="7768816">Yes, because the State is proceeding to enforce the statute therefore, it's necessary in the classic terms of an equity court where there is clear, present, immediate irreparable injury to fundamental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.030" offset="7840078">The concept of the power of a federal court of equity which the Fifth Circuit has over the last three or four years were gone to wrestle with and develop a concept which is essential in the civil rights cases now developing in the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.666" offset="7890651">Because where state action regardless of the form it takes, criminal or civil, where state action has the immediate impact of casting a poll upon the exercise of First Amendment rights particularly in an area where those rights are essential to enforce and implement the struggle to bring into reality, the rights granted under the Fifteenth Amendment, the voting rights, in a situation like that where First Amendment rights are essential to bring about an enforcement of voting rights, there particularly the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.788" offset="8075076">And Judge Wisdom points this out though sharply in his dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.175" offset="8092630">There, the Fifth Circuit has said, “It is the duty of a federal court of equity of Federal District Court not to refuse to litigate and adjudicate this fundamental constitutional federal question”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.235" offset="8140904">Otherwise, there is no road to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.738" offset="8150936">Otherwise, the federal court is saying as was suggested by this Court in England, Justice Brennan's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.586" offset="8178312">This -- the Federal District Court is saying, the Federal District Court is secondary in the federal-state system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.568" offset="8214256">And what has happened here is the warning in England and the warning in Justice Douglas' opinion, concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.688" offset="8246648">What has happened here is that this concept of deference to the state court of abstention which started in the Pullman decision has now turned into a nightmare in the south, had now turned in to it's -- on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.944" offset="8315716">And what has happened here is an extraordinary thing as Judge Wisdom points out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.245" offset="8332957">Certainly, the Federal District Court, like the majority in this case, seem to believe that what abstention means is that you differ to a state court in matters of federal law that a Federal District Court may not rule on fundamental federal questions, that it must first turn to the state court and the state court will adjudicate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.167" offset="8428565">Well, the answer of that is clearly in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.439" offset="8441731">The answer to that is Baggett and Bullitt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2140.304" offset="8561162">Because that injury to the constitutional right is not an injury, it's that a deterrent upon the exercise of fundamental First Amendment freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.338" offset="8609332">Now, where the injury in the state action, the threatened injury is to deter people from meeting together, from speaking, from going to a voter registration place in Louisiana because they're afraid that the person who is asking him to go to the voter registration place is a SCEF representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.427" offset="8689685">And if you are seen with the SCEF representative in Louisiana, you may well be indicted for violation of these laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.141" offset="8720509">Worst than that, this committee which is the primary source of the enforcement of these laws as Judge Wisdom points out, not three months after the institution of this action against the Southern Conference Educational Fund -- Dr. Dombrowski the executive director and again, its lawyers, not three months after that they issued a report in which they told us what the next step of the selective enforcement of these laws are going to be.</text>

            <text syncTime="2264.746" offset="9058952">Absolutely Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.183" offset="9064699">That's United States against Woods which is an extremely interesting opinion of Judge Reed in the Fifth Circuit, certiorari denied by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.427" offset="9101688">That's exactly that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.859" offset="9107435">There you had a constitutional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.486" offset="9113913">I believe it was an assault and battery case involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.073" offset="9128229">There, Judge Reed said for the majority of the court, “The important thing is not what the label that the State puts on the statute but the state is using this clearly to harass and intimidate a voter registration movement in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.810" offset="9195207">Therefore, we're going to restrain this criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.093" offset="9208372">Now, I should make one point on that which I think disposes totally of this question of whether we have to awake the courses of the normal criminal law in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.422" offset="9257587">First place, the clear answer to that is that that's no relief to the deterrent effect of these statutes on the thousands and thousands of people who are about to engage in a voter registration activity movement in the State of Louisiana, no relief whatsoever but more than that very simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.879" offset="9335432">This Court is disposed of that problem again and again in Ex parte Young, in Fenner against Boykin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.626" offset="9358420">The federal proceeding was instituted here before the state criminal indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.859" offset="9379422">Only last term, this Court disposed of an abstention argument and I believe a Virginia reapportionment case by saying that we don't even reach that question because if you're going to apply concepts of committee then clearly, the Federal District Court which had jurisdiction although our District Court judges below work to know it seems they've had difficulty in discovering a ground for federal jurisdiction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.948" offset="9475762">Where the Federal District Court clearly had jurisdiction and we think not even our opponents argue that the Court didn't have jurisdiction and it starts its action, we started our action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.095" offset="9516304">The indictments were then after the complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.272" offset="9529051">Ex parte Young is dispositive on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.120" offset="9540441">The federal court is seized with jurisdiction, has the duty and obligation to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.694" offset="9558727">Now, if I may turn to a moment for another side of the coin of this problem because this appeal brings before the Court, it calls for a reexamination and reaffirmation of the principles of supersedure which this Court laid down 11 years ago in Pennsylvania against Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.033" offset="9640124">Now, these statutes and the case before the Court at this moment, I would suggest a classic example of the wisdom of the Court's ruling in Nelson and the importance of a strict enforcement of this rule because what we are dealing with here are statutes which are expressly and openly designed by the state legislature to proscribe the same conduct, the very same conduct as conduct proscribe by a complex of federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.401" offset="9781603">Now, Louisiana leaves nothing to our imagination on this question because we're openly informed both in the preambles and in the body of the statute that the conduct to be regulated is identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.752" offset="9842939">Identical to the conduct to be regulated in the Internal Security Act and the Communist Control Act, and what is it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.278" offset="9869061">It's conduct which flows from what the legislature here describes as activities of the World Communist Movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.960" offset="9899781">It's not local state maneuvering that they're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.888" offset="9919530">They describe what they call the world Communist conspiracy, exactly word for word the preamble from the McCarran Act, and they say that's the conduct we are going to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.415" offset="9965610">And as a matter of fact, they justify it in an interesting way which the Court will observe in the preambles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.800" offset="9987135">Not because there's something concerning local affairs but because in their opinion, Louisiana is different from other states in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.720" offset="10022870">Of course, Louisiana had special international and national concerns because they say there is a location of many vital military establishments of the nation in Louisiana, therefore, we have to enact this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.365" offset="10081384">Now, if the statutes did not openly, I mean, were -- we don't have a situation where we have to have analogy here or we have to infer anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.416" offset="10117642">The legislatures told us what they're doing even if they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.529" offset="10138018">We have an extraordinary statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.589" offset="10150348">What does Louisiana want to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.481" offset="10161842">It wants to punish conduct which federal agencies have designated as subversive or what you will, whatever that word means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.899" offset="10219520">So that here, our state has set up a structure and it says, when the Subversive Activities Control Board or when a committee of Congress said something about an organization, that's the conduct we want to do something about because that's the presumption that the organization is subversive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.236" offset="10296842">Now, I suggest to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.221" offset="10304784">This is a frank effort to regulate conduct more than in a field occupied by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.087" offset="10328294">But more than that, what is astounding about it is that they want to put penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.569" offset="10350237">They want to send people to prison for six years because they belong to an organization named by the House Committee on Un-American Activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.330" offset="10389316">Well, Congress itself has never reached that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.979" offset="10403840">Congress itself, I would suggest, would not dream of enacting legislation like that that says nothing of the constitutional problems that are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.099" offset="10436336">But what's the heart of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.334" offset="10445322">The heart is that they don't really argue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.577" offset="10458279">That these statutes do not move into an area occupied by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.845" offset="10479282">The heart of their position is a plea to overrule Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.760" offset="10494955">And they put it quite just bluntly in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.177" offset="10508643">They say, even if the Louisiana legislation was directed at the same conduct, the same conduct, the words of this Court governed by the congressional legislation, no -- there is no valid reason why there could not be concurrent jurisdiction in this field as there is in so many other criminal matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.566" offset="10610207">That's their real argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.529" offset="10618044">But Nelson has settled down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.030" offset="10628075">The Congress has occupied this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.421" offset="10633613">There is no concurrent state jurisdiction in areas occupied by the Internal Security Act and the Communist Control Act, the essence of the problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2672.266" offset="10688993">I think that we can -- we could leave Your Honor directly within the Uphaus rule because in Uphaus, Mr. Justice Clark, while there maybe some restrictions on the breadth of Nelson which are not involved in this situation, Mr. Justice Clark says “In reaffirming Nelson, Uphaus does not overrule Nelson as certain of the District Court judges seem to believe and some of our adversaries believe, not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.718" offset="10786795">In Uphaus, the test is the same conduct test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.080" offset="10808320">Is the same conduct proscribe by the state legislation as the federal legislation, we say, there can be no argument on that here, all one has to do is read the statutes and the conduct is precisely the same conduct which is proscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.761" offset="10867043">So we don't have to reach the question here Your Honor as to the farther reaches of Uphaus or the farther reaches of Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.818" offset="10895256">Here, this is a -- I would suggest a direct open in the chart situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.940" offset="10915736">Now, the essence of the problem and the reason why we suggest that it is so important for this Court to reaffirm Nelson is that in fact, what is involved here is that Louisiana opposes and is dissatisfied with the policies underlying federal enforcement of the federal statutes occupying this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.562" offset="11006224">Now, they're open about that, they're open.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.661" offset="11014583">They openly disagree with national policies of enforcement in this area and there are two very sharp examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.670" offset="11038616">I would suggest that never before the statute come before this Court in which the legislature says openly as they do in this preamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.648" offset="11070589">The reason they're passing their law is that federal legislation on this subject matter is either inadequate in scope or not being effectively enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.873" offset="11115416">They make no bones about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.409" offset="11125551">They don't believe that the federal anti-subversive legislation is being effectively enforced and this came out in a most dramatic way when as the day after the raids in New Orleans when the committee said, “Why, didn't you go to the FBI?</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.038" offset="11192111">You say there is a question of subversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.048" offset="11200157">Why didn't you go to the federal authority?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.047" offset="11212173">They said and this is in the record, “We knew that if we told the FBI about this raid, they would have to tell Bobby Kennedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.056" offset="11244147">We cannot trust him and we expect him to tell his friend Martin Luther King.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.092" offset="11264313">Now what do we have here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.064" offset="11268180">You put that together with the preamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.038" offset="11276121">It's a fundamental disagreement with federal enforcement policy and it's illustrated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.182" offset="11296705">Louisiana acted to enforce these laws precisely because federal policy was not to enforce the anti-subversive laws against civil rights organizations or very specifically Your Honors, against the Southern Conference Educational Fund or against the National Lawyers Guild.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.148" offset="11368490">There's no federal proceeding under the SCAB against Southern Conference Educational Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.309" offset="11389179">It's never been named on the Attorney General's list.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.096" offset="11404330">It's never been called before the federal agency which is supposed to regulate conduct in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.003" offset="11427944">And as the Court knows the only time there was the slightest development in respect to National Lawyers Guild was when the Attorney General once started a proceeding and quickly dropped that proceeding informing the organization, there was no evidence to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.442" offset="11493669">National Federal Policy in the last several years has been clear in administering the federal anti-subversive laws not to permit them to be “to interfere with the southern civil rights movement with the activities of Negro and White organizations trying to implement the Fourteenth Amendment and the Fifteenth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.750" offset="11570991">But what is the conflict here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.630" offset="11578514">Judge Wisdom put his finger on it in a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.915" offset="11591576">The conflict is one in fundamental policies underlying the enforcement of laws in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.113" offset="11612369">Judge Wisdom says, “The Louisiana legislature regards the movement to increase Negro voting in that state as part of the Communist conspiracy”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.194" offset="11652702">Well, that's the knub of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.584" offset="11662315">They want to use this concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.992" offset="11675899">They ask this Court to give them in reversing Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.494" offset="11693976">They want to use this to proceed selectively against the most active civil rights organizations in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.165" offset="11728562">Now, we don't have to speculate against that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.642" offset="11738488">They have indictments against Southern Conference Educational Fund against its lawyers who represent them, southern White lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.291" offset="11769104">I ask this Court to consider from the deterrent point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.434" offset="11785718">You're going to ask southern White lawyers to stand up and be counted, to make the responsibility of the bar when you permit state statutes of this kind to be used to arrest them, to take files out of their offices, to harass them because they're lawyers to Southern Conference Educational Fund, because they represent civil rights organizations, because of the ACLU lawyer in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.308" offset="11889162">Well, there is the deterrence which is no longer speculative in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3126.014" offset="12503980">It's permitted to be used against, against the civil rights movement then you have the sharpest conflict with national policy and I would suggest the sharpest danger to the national interest because if the national security lines in any one thing at this moment this Court has said, the president has said, the Congress has said and it lies in the full and fair and pre-enforcement of the voting provisions in the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.001" offset="12647967">Now, this Court will face tomorrow, United States against Louisiana which I suggest is the other side of the coin of this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.982" offset="12679837">Because what is the good of striking down unconstitutional voting laws in Louisiana, if you permit the people who in light must enforce these laws, who must go to the post to register, who must take the courage in their hands and it takes courage in the south today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.091" offset="12760294">And the headline showed that area to area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.216" offset="12776803">What good does it do to strike the laws down if on the other hand we are to permit the harassment, the intimidation, the deterring of the utilization of the First Amendment liberties which are so essential to enforce these laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.717" offset="12834795">Now, I would suggest that this problem, we don't have a series of conceptual problems here or preemption of abstention of equity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.714" offset="12886831">They all boil down to one thing because the key to the solution of the conceptual problems, I suggest to the Court on abstention on federal power lies in the nature of the right involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.930" offset="12947644">The nature of the fact that what is here before the Court is the protection of First Amendment liberties, the deterrent impact of an overly broad statute or a statute including in a field occupied by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.621" offset="13002397">Now, as Judge Wisdom points out in his dissenting opinion, it's extraordinary to suggest that a Federal District Court doesn't have power in a situation like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.059" offset="13056209">It's extraordinary to dismiss this complaint out of hand and it's interesting in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.723" offset="13082854">At one point, the entire rationale of the majority breaks down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.570" offset="13106260">They have no difficulty whatsoever in ruling on preemption as Judge Wisdom points out the contradiction in their rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.184" offset="13148682">But it was clear when it got to the question of preemption, you could not argue that there was any point to deferring to a state court in ruling on the question of preemption or classic federal question governed by the Supremacy Clause, therefore, there was no at the slightest shred of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.743" offset="13242932">And without explaining it -- without explaining it they rule on preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.874" offset="13271458">They had to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.127" offset="13276473">Our opponents don't even suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.106" offset="13284415">It wasn't proper for them to rule on preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.983" offset="13295909">The Nelson case is squarely before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.458" offset="13305731">Nobody argues that anybody should have deferred on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.599" offset="13322344">But I suggest that the precisely same principle applies to the question of the First Amendment vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.944" offset="13359752">This is a federal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.934" offset="13367693">In our federal, abstention means nothing unless it's treated as a principle of committee which is governing federal-state relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.800" offset="13403115">If there is anything that is essential in federal-state relationships, it's the primacy of the federal court, of the national court in protecting the essential, fundamental national right which makes the whole system work and I suggest to the Court that the First Amendment rights, the protection of these rights, the striking down of these statutes are essential to the preservation of state rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.370" offset="13513456">They're essential to the preservation of the system of federal-state relationships because the answer to that, I think, was given to us by Chief Justice Stone in discussing, in suggesting that the very special character of the First Amendment right flows from the fact that it is the fundamental guarantee of the people of its control over institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.397" offset="13605512">Now, if you're going to give a state autonomy within a federal-state system there must be the fundamental controls over that state which our system of government calls for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.108" offset="13652428">And those fundamental controls are the pre-exercise of First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.761" offset="13674998">That's the ultimate guarantee that the people will control the state, federal -- the federal government of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.666" offset="13698612">And when a state clogs up the channels by deterring the exercise of these rights by what I suggest is the most incredibly broad statute this Court has ever faced, then it is the duty of a Federal District Court, the duty of a Federal District Court to intervene under the system of federal-state relationships because the preservation of these rights are the first obligation of the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.503" offset="13825985">Now, we ask this Court, we ask this Court to reaffirm the duty and obligation of the Federal District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.910" offset="13855556">Otherwise, we say to the Court, we will face an extraordinarily serious situation in the south today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.087" offset="13884291">We will face the closing down of the only available tribunals left to us to reaffirm and protect fundamental federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.934" offset="13927654">This Court knows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.047" offset="13932147">The Fifth Circuit has been struggling with that for the last three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.532" offset="13942073">Judge Wisdom states it in the most eloquent terms to this Court, if the Federal District Courts are permitted to turn abstention on its head, if they are permitted to take comment into a license to advocate federal responsibility, if they are permitted to take Douglas against Jeannette and turn it into a total application of federal equity jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.191" offset="14028696">If they are permitted to take Nelson and put it on the shelf, then they are saying that the doors of the Federal District Courts in the south are closed -- are closed for protection, are closed for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.943" offset="14095673">Now, if we say to the Negro people in the south, if we say this is a system of law and you will obtain your objectives through the processes of law, we, the bar, the courts, have our own special obligation and that is to see that the tribunals remain open because I suggest to the Court that if -- if the approach taken by west and now it's below and other federal district judges that this Court is well aware out of Mississippi, out of Alabama, out of Louisiana, if these approaches permitted to stand then the federal tribunal in the most critical of cases is closed, and what do we say?</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.639" offset="14318550">Where do you turn?</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.504" offset="14325969">Where do you go?</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.040" offset="14336104">Where do you find the relief which a system of law is designed to protect us?</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.334" offset="14365257">We ask the Court for relief in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3600.983" offset="14403918">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.127" offset="14416457">It's unfortunate that other members of the bar involved in this state criminal proceeding and I sympathize with this particular situation how it does not in any way, manner, shape or form change the nature of the issue which is before this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.728" offset="14494824">And this is a question of jurisdiction of federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.832" offset="14511229">This matter was pointed up in the decision of the lower court on page 74 where it said, “For the good of all, it is to be hoped that this case will reach the Supreme Court so that the matter of state-federal relations and the judicial field may be clarified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.574" offset="14582282">What the appellants are asking you to do here today is to allow federal intrusion upon a state criminal proceeding in the face of a federal statute which expressly prohibits such intrusion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.972" offset="14655843">This is 28 United States Code 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.475" offset="14697848">And it reads, “A court of the United States may not grant an injunction to state proceedings in a state court except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress or where a necessary in aid of its jurisdiction or to protect or effectuate its judgments.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.476" offset="14769842">Now, there had been two cases, the office of both opinions was Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Toucey versus New York, 314 U.S. 118, in Amalgamated Clothing Workers versus Richman, a later case 348 U.S. 511.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.653" offset="14854583">In those two cases, there were several proceedings involved and not criminal state proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.078" offset="14884258">The only case which they cite in which this particular prohibition, statutory prohibition is not involved as Ex parte Young.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.424" offset="14917695">Ex parte Young was a matter in which an injunction from a federal court had issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.841" offset="14939324">A State Attorney General in the face of that injunction went and fall in a mandamus proceeding and they found them in contempt of that particular federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.733" offset="14982896">In the light of the sequence of the events which have transpired in the matter, how could these appellants feel that there was no doubt that there were state criminal proceedings pending and initiated on October the 2nd, 1963 when search warrants and arrest warrants were issued by the courts, criminal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.423" offset="15069623">As result of that, an execution of search warrants and the warrants of arrest, these were executed on October the 4th, 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.570" offset="15106194">On October the 25th, these appellants went into the Criminal District Court within our state and asked that they not be bound over for trial, that there was no evidence justifying the issuance of the arrest warrants and the State District Court agreed with them and they were discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.923" offset="15179651">On that same date, the District Attorney or his chief assistant told these particular appellants that these matters were going to be turned over to the grand jury for the state to continue its prosecution in these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3811.842" offset="15247360">Then -- and the appellants well -- well aware of this because if you'll notice in the record, the original injunction which Judge Wisdom issued by way of motion, they named in this particular motion as well as in the times of order of injunction which did formulated for the judge's signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.523" offset="15330011">The judge of the division or section of the Criminal District Court, the foreman of the grand jury and each member of that grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.285" offset="15365120">And truth in fact, this is -- this was a lawsuit in the federal court against -- it's truly against the State of Louisiana because this is what the desire the judge would -- he struck the name of the judge, the Criminal District Judge in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.106" offset="15424366">He struck the name of the foreman and the members of the grand jury but he allowed the injunction to issue against the governor and what I'm arguing now is pointed up by the motion to dismiss on jurisdictional grounds filed by the governor which the Court is considered to take up today with the other arguments presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="3947.507" offset="15789976">And then upon January 6th or 7th, they vacated the temporary restraining order and thereafter, the District Attorney took the evidence which he had down to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.262" offset="15840967">And that evidence is still with the District Attorney and it's a part of the criminal proceeding which was instituted on October the 2nd, 1963 as a result of the search warrants which were signed by the judges and also as a consequence of the warrants of arrest which were vacated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3995.767" offset="15982968">There's not doubt about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3996.960" offset="15987775">These appellants are well aware that they went into the federal court to restrain exactly what restrain this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.821" offset="16019226">They were well aware of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.853" offset="16023406">The District Attorney told them, “We're taking this evidence and we're going to put it before the grand jury and we're going to continue with our proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.131" offset="16048483">And of course appellants want you to think that the indictment is the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.965" offset="16063843">Without an indictment, there's no proceeding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4018.525" offset="16074083">But as in the Uphaus it would really be a race to the federal courthouse, between the federal courthouse and the state courthouse, if someone got to win that they are going to be prosecuted by the State and could beat the first person down to sign an affidavit of the State, beat him to the federal court before he got to the state courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.553" offset="16158198">But there is no doubt about this, they have accepted this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.225" offset="16172826">The indictments came down and then Mr. Dombrowski went before Judge Flat and asked that the evidence which would have been seized in -- on October 4th that would be suppressed as far as his proceeding was concerned and the judge granted that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.552" offset="16242207">In the meanwhile, these other appellants filed certain motions in their particular cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.969" offset="16263837">They were allotted to different -- various sections of the Criminal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.975" offset="16279824">So there's no doubt that they were not aware of the proceedings that were actually filed on the record in the Criminal District Court in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.224" offset="16320888">Now, as soon as this Court, Judge Flat granted their motion to suppress or Mr. Dombrowski's motion to suppress on June 12.</text>

            <text syncTime="4136.694" offset="16546691">So that there's no reason to suspect that but the main -- the main issue in this case is that, these state criminal proceedings were on the way on October the 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.935" offset="16583680">The appellants knew it and they cannot -- cannot overcome this because the statute is completely expressed.</text>

            <text syncTime="5504.386" offset="22017463">There is a rule of presumptive evidence in this particular section of the statute, it's on number 3 on page 2 (a) of appellant's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5513.968" offset="22055811">And the purpose of this simply was to eliminate the confusion in the minds of people who belong to these different types of organizations so that if they know and actually have knowledge that the organization has been so cited as commented here under this presumptive evidence rule which had been put in that they should go and register.</text>
            <text syncTime="5536.515" offset="22145985">We feel like that this is an adequate definition for the main reason that it requires knowledge on the part of the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="6207.680" offset="24830642">The state had full power to deal with internal civil disturbances, thus, registration statute's full warrant to all proceedings as to subversive corporations, the subversive instigation of rights and a host of other subjects, directly affecting state security furnished grips for the State's legislative mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="6226.203" offset="24904725">And we feel like that the statute is valid under that particular language.</text>

            <text syncTime="6241.499" offset="24965956">The Uphaus decision clearly recognizes the State's right to self protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="6245.210" offset="24980793">This is a key point in Uphaus.</text>

            <text syncTime="6250.692" offset="25002736">The Nelson case itself recognizes this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6253.956" offset="25015798">The Constitution guarantees to the State a republican form of government and there is no reason why the State should not be carrying this function out particularly when the guidelines of how to do it are so clearly set forth in Nelson and Uphaus.</text>
            <text syncTime="6268.625" offset="25074416">If they were not and if there were no decisions on this, I could see some justification for the point of view that the State should not be into this business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6275.688" offset="25102733">But as long as the Court has clearly defined the realm wherein the State might proceed, I think the State's not only have a right but an obligation to do what they can for their own self protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="6326.980" offset="25307847">If the federal government under such a doctrine did enter into regulation, the only way they could do it would be by a federal police force and what would amount ultimately to a police state that none of us want.</text>

            <text syncTime="6384.446" offset="25537724">Next, there is no required in our statute and this was not the case in the Washington statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6390.939" offset="25563742">Next, our statute was rewritten for the specific purpose of complying with the decisions in Nelson and Uphaus and this was not the case in the Washington statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6401.731" offset="25606896">It went clear back behind the rule of Nelson and our statute has been revised to a much, we think, more credible criteria of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="6413.076" offset="25652245">And finally, in the Baggett case, there was no pending criminal prosecution, this relates back up to 2283.</text>

            <text syncTime="6686.096" offset="26744372">Counsel alleges that this statute is set up to bring about both restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6692.167" offset="26768614">Well, I would only suggest an answer to this that large numbers of new voters are in fact registering now to vote in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="6699.489" offset="26797871">They're in no way hampered by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6701.531" offset="26806021">It deals only with subversion and it is only been applied to such.</text>
            <text syncTime="6705.429" offset="26821695">We believe that any legitimate civil rights group can work in Louisiana without violating the statute on subversive activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6713.037" offset="26852101">There's no reason why they can't do it because this thing deals with overt acts in a highly specific manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="6719.879" offset="26879478">Now, I have one item to answer to Mr. Hubert's argument, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="6724.943" offset="26899749">He suggested that I was a defendant in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6727.595" offset="26910302">I am not and have never been.</text>
            <text syncTime="6731.073" offset="26924199">One other point I want to make an answer to Mr. Kinoy's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6734.967" offset="26939768">He suggests that there was an unconstitutional application of the statute in this case and I could only answer that by a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6743.451" offset="26973727">How could the State better get due process to these defendants than by preparing the evidence which they had in the form of affidavits and taking it to a Criminal Court judge, offering it to him and saying, Judge, here is our case against these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="6760.618" offset="27042377">We think search warrants are the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6762.651" offset="27050527">Will you consider this and give us your ruling as to whether there exists adequate cause in this case and if so, sign these search warrants for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="6771.431" offset="27085636">Now, this is exactly what was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="6773.798" offset="27095144">And by signing the search warrants, the judge ruled that there was adequate cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="6778.670" offset="27114580">He had to, to sign to justify the signing of those search warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="6782.666" offset="27130567">Now, we have given these people due process all the way through this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6786.614" offset="27146449">There has been no unconstitutional application of this statute in any way, shape or form.</text>
            <text syncTime="6795.421" offset="27181662">In conclusion, the sole issue as we see it legally before this Court is a question of whether the lower court had jurisdiction particularly under the statute, Section 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="6809.701" offset="27238713">There's no decision or record from the court below to justify the Court at this time going any further into the case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6819.086" offset="27276330">I'm sure the Court is aware that there has been some criticism on this point against the Court from outside sources on taking cases piecemeal and this is what this would amount to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6828.591" offset="27314364">Eventually, by the process of criminal justice, this case will probably reach the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6833.675" offset="27334635">And if the Court decides one issue today and the trial of these people continues and they are convicted, it will be back here again eventually.</text>
            <text syncTime="6843.259" offset="27372983">Secondly, Title XXVIII, Section 2283 is highly specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="6849.096" offset="27396284">It clearly and particularly prohibits exactly what the appellants want the Court to do in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6856.415" offset="27425646">Can and should a federal court enjoin a pending state criminal procedure?</text>
            <text syncTime="6861.380" offset="27445499">Well, the Congress says -- it simply said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="6864.969" offset="27459814">That's all it is to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6865.907" offset="27463576">They've said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="6867.806" offset="27471203">Ours is a government basically of divided powers.Our overriding goal should be a principle constitutionalism of the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers are fundamental in the Constitution itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6883.685" offset="27534733">They're even recognized in the Bill of Rights in Article X.</text>
            <text syncTime="6888.049" offset="27552183">The Constitution in the Bill of Rights and in the Fourteenth Amendment, any construction of this which violates the basic principles of constitutionalism should be very strictly applied by the courts and it should be very seriously considered because however great the appeal this might be in a single case, the overall principles of the Constitution must stand fast and basically in the -- inherent in them are the two things of federalism and separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6924.773" offset="27698991">I would answer further by saying simply that the prime responsibility of any government, over and above and overriding that to even its individual citizens is maintenance of the government within the constitutional framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="6942.806" offset="27771193">This is fundamental, the basic, single responsibility of any government to maintain itself within the constitutional framework and we urge that if these two sections of the Constitution are in fact in conflict in this case that the overriding of basic principle constitutionalism should prevail and we ask that the Court affirm the judgment of the lower court.</text>
