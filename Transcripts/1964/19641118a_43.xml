            <text syncTime="25.637" offset="102504">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.960" offset="111804">This case comes here on petition for certiorari from the Supreme Court of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.008" offset="131971">It presents one single but we feel a very important question of law involving industrial relations under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.392" offset="177528">That question is simply this that the person asserting a claim for severance pay based solely on the provisions of a collective bargaining contract governed by the Labor Management Relations Act as amended have to exhaust the binding grievance arbitration procedure provided for in the contract before he can sue in a court of law an effort to enforce his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.631" offset="286511">All of the Alabama courts below held that he was not required to exhaust these administrative or grievance and arbitration procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.468" offset="325799">We feel that this holding was fairly erroneous and contrary to the controlling federal substantive law enunciated by this Court since the Lincoln Mills decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.633" offset="378462">At the outset I think it might be well for me to state that this is not a case like that in Humphrey versus Moore where the individual claimant might assert that he was unable to have a fair determination of his trial under the grievance and arbitration procedure because of some conflict -- conflicting interest on the part of his union or some connivance on the part of the union and the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.687" offset="482743">The complaint contains no allegation that the respondent ever requested his union to even invoke the arbitration and grievance procedure in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.314" offset="525166">It was -- it has been simply the respondent's position throughout this litigation that under the Alabama law that he was not required to resort to the grievance arbitration procedure before suing in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.003" offset="583993">The facts are relatively undisputed and in -- and as a matter of fact, they've quoted by stipulation of facts which we entered into in order to avoid the necessity of a lengthy trial so that this matter could be presented as a question of law and decided properly for the courts of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.440" offset="669675">First, I like to point out that the labor contract in this case was between the petitioner and the exclusive bargaining agent of the respondent and covered two mines located in Jefferson County, Alabama, Spaulding and Edwards mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.263" offset="732996">It was in the usual form and was very comprehensive in nature, covering every phase of the employment relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.278" offset="769045">Petitioner was admittedly engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.162" offset="784614">In that contract was Section 14 which set out a severance or separation pay provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.485" offset="813871">This particular provision was of the conditional type.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.215" offset="828813">That is a person was entitled a separation pay only upon a determination that the man or a substantial portion of the man, a plant where he worked was closed down permanently within the meaning of that particular contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.788" offset="899135">He was not entitled to separation pay because of layoffs for economic reasons, automation or lack of hours or lack of business.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel H. Burr</label>
            <text syncTime="337.594" offset="1350322">I agree with that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.878" offset="1359412">I like to point out that the arbitration clause in this case is very broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.337" offset="1381251">It's in more or less the standard phraseology, it provides for the three grievance steps followed by binding arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.619" offset="1418449">There is -- there is even a provision that says in the interest of expeditious handling of a claim under this contract that the parties can agree on other types of procedure under the contract for the hearing of the grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.539" offset="1474142">The scope of the arbitration provision is very broad covering any differences arising between the company and the union as to the interpretation or application of our compliance with the provisions of this agreement or as to any question relating to wages, hours of work, other conditions of employment of any employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.117" offset="1560451">A complaint of any employee -- any complaint of an employee is first attempted to be settled with his foreman, if it's not settled, then -- and that -- then it goes into the grievance steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.149" offset="1608516">I might also point out that there's no provision whatsoever as was true in the Independent Petroleum Workers case now pending before this Court which attempted to withdraw any particular appeal from the arbitration coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.501" offset="1678002">That brings me to the facts of the layoff of this petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.695" offset="1698691">On December 16th, 1953, the respondent was laid off from active work, an enforced reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.138" offset="1728470">At that time under the stipulation of facts, a dispute existed as to whether this layoff was due to a permanent closing of the mines or the portion of the mines where he worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.965" offset="1775804">As I said, the respondent made no effort whatsoever to exhaust the administrative grievance or grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.540" offset="1802136">Instead, he waited some two years and seven months after the time of his layoff and filed a suit in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County claiming severance pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.356" offset="1845394">When the case came on for trial, this Court had decided the Lincoln Mills case.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.723" offset="1866815">Other federal courts had intimated that this was a question of federal law that favored the enforceability of arbitration, provisions and labor contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.295" offset="1909133">So, we defended the case on the grounds that the respondent had failed to invoke or to exhaust the grievance remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.641" offset="1950511">In this connection I think it would be fair to point out that the respondent in his brief in this Court for the first time argues that the severance pay claim was not contemplated by the parties as being subject to the grievance procedure suggesting in support of this argument that the respondent could not have filed his claim within 30 days after the date of his layoff because of the absence of any foreman, a mine committeeman at the plant that he worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.938" offset="2075690">We must go outside of the record to answer that.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.376" offset="2089482">As a matter of actual fact, the mine committee was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.386" offset="2109544">The contract continued into operation for months after the plaintiff's layoff until this particular union was succeeded by a successor union, a new contract was negotiated with substantially the same grievance and arbitration procedure in the same severance pay procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.292" offset="2193136">The trial court rejected our defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.928" offset="2203690">On appeal to the Court of Appeals of Alabama and while the case was pending there, this Court decided the Steelworkers trilogy in June of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.835" offset="2247262">We call these important cases to the attention of the Court of Appeals, our intermediate appellate court in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.944" offset="2275683">Nevertheless, that court took the position based on two prior Alabama Supreme Court cases primarily, TCI versus Sizemore and Woodward Iron Company versus Stringfellow that it was not necessary for the plaintiff to exhaust the administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.981" offset="2347886">Neither of these cases considered the import of the Lincoln Mills' holding that a new field of federal law was being fashioned which governed this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.493" offset="2389891">Vaguely significant that the Sizemore case relied on by the Court of Appeals was based on the same common law rule developed in the commercial arbitration field that this Court deemed inconsistent with the congressional policy found in the Labor of Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.872" offset="2467422">When the case reached the Alabama Supreme Court that Court felt constrained to recognize the existence of the federal law, in my opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.187" offset="2508696">Nevertheless, it believed that under the federal law, it was still free to carve out from the general doctrine, favoring the enforceability of agreements to arbitrate in labor contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.841" offset="2567314">Certain facts of claims like the severance pay claim in this case where the individual claimant was no longer employed actively by the company and where he was not seeking reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.019" offset="2628023">This type of reasoning would cover the severance pay claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.145" offset="2640562">We think it would cover wrongful discharge claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.441" offset="2653727">It would cover claims for back pay brought by retired or resigned employees or terminated employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.519" offset="2689985">We feel that in making this distinction, the Supreme Court of Alabama first reached over in the Railway Labor field to take the decisions of this Court in Moore versus Illinois and TWA versus Koppal and apply that to the industrial field under the Labor Management Relations Act and then misconstrued the holdings of this Court to reach that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.240" offset="2792908">We feel the --</text>

            <text syncTime="781.580" offset="3126230">This point has been so well established in Lucas Flour and Smith versus Evening News.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.964" offset="3151830">In other decisions, it seems unnecessary to argue the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.125" offset="3168444">But it is interesting to me that these very decisions point out and emphasize the necessity of a uniformity of decisions that you obtain by using the proper grievance and arbitration procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.021" offset="3224033">The Lucas Flour opinion for example points out the possibility that individual contract terms may have different meanings on a conflicting state and federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.689" offset="3270740">It points out the desirability of adjusting claims under the agreed upon procedure as a part of collective bargaining itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.082" offset="3308251">Now, we can -- I believe anyone can readily visualize the disruptive results on the collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.901" offset="3343569">If for example, various claimants similarly situated in claiming severance pay under the same labor contract and perhaps in state -- in different jurisdictions because these contracts cover more than one state very often, are allowed to bring different suits before different courts, different juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.771" offset="3439073">I think it's obvious that this would have a very disruptive and disadvantage -- disadvantageous effect on the collective bargaining contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.636" offset="3478465">It would certainly in our opinion discourage employers who are willing now to include severance pay and separation pay provision in their contract if the employers are going to be denied the right to have matters involving those provisions determined under the agreed upon -- by the agreed upon tribunal as a result of conflicting state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.726" offset="3578880">The decisions under the one body of uniform federal law decided by this Court certainly favor the full enforceability of coll -- of arbitration provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.945" offset="3635722">This -- the basic foundation for this principle is found in Section 203 (d) of the Act itself which provides that the final adjustment by a method agreed upon by the parties is determined desirable under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.381" offset="3705522">The Steelworkers trilogy has set out definitely that this is proper under the federal scheme of things and they say that you should not exclude as we read those decisions from the coverage of the arbitration provision, any matter involving the contract unless positive assurance can be found that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation covering the asserted dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.048" offset="3828088">The broad scope of this doctrine has been enunciated further in the Drake case, in the Needham case, in John Wiley versus Livingston case whereas a matter of fact the Court mentioned that typically included in collective bargaining agreements or such matters as seniority status and severance pay, the very type of claim in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.125" offset="3940415">Here again, the unanimous opinion of this Court said that the matter was going by federal law, not conflicting state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.771" offset="3979076">It emphasized again the central and primary role of the arbitration process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.649" offset="4006557">It mentioned that the agreement covered the entire employment relation and stated that an employer would have to arbitrate under an expired contract as I remember the case where the plant involved had been closed down after a consolidation of merger or merger of the employer involved by another company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.233" offset="4104882">We believe very strongly that all of the reasons set out in those cases favoring the arbitration, the full enforceability of the arbitration process fully apply to a severance pay claim, the desirability of uniform results, the ex -- the expertise available under the arbitration process, the statutory right of the union to participate properly in the adjustment of grievances, and a prompt and expeditious disposition of these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.551" offset="4230165">Incidentally, the contract itself provided for appropriate time limits for the filing of agreements and between the grievance steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.412" offset="4265587">The severance pay claim by nature we believe is particularly suited to be held under the arbitration machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.961" offset="4303830">For instance, one of those items that is subject to good faith bargaining like any other condition of employment, it is solely a breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.951" offset="4343745">It's like any other monetary claim based on the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.332" offset="4361300">In essence, it is just a form of deferred payment paid to an employee in return for work performed under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.898" offset="4403513">It is specifically set out in the contract and one clause at Section 14, the severance pay and Section 10 is the arbitration provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.771" offset="4443011">Certainly, the party has intended that this matter be determined under the agreed upon tribunal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1191.655" offset="4766616">And no, there's nothing in the record that intimates why the claimant in this case did not attempt to exhaust the administrative remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1211.864" offset="4847386">We feel certainly that the obligation to exhaust the administrative remedies applies to the employee as well as to the union and the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.093" offset="4884271">We feel in the interest of a fair policy under the uniform federal law arbitration must work both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.854" offset="4923350">It cannot be a one way street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.545" offset="4934113">If it is favored by public policy when one party demands it then at the same time, we believe that is -- that the same public policy favors it and that the employer in this case can defend on a basis that the grievance with machinery has not been followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.308" offset="5013211">We believe actually the Court has recognized this by a footnote to the decision of Smith versus Evening News which it mentioned in upholding the concurrent jurisdictions to entertain a 301 type suit that in the case in Smith there was no grievance arbitration procedure on the contract which had to be exhausted before result could be had to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.915" offset="5115611">And following the import of the Supreme Court cases from Lincoln Mills through the trilogy to Drake, the Second Circuit for example has held that former employees could not bring suit for wrongful discharge and a suit governed by the Labor Management Relations Act without seeking to obtain redressed through the grievance arbitration procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.392" offset="5213518">The same result has been followed, had been reached by the Fourth Circuit in Henderson versus Eastern Gas and Fuel Company cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.586" offset="5250299">We believe those decisions to be proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.304" offset="5265136">This brings me to my final thought of my argument which relates to the Railway Labor Act cases upon which we feel the Supreme Court of Alabama erroneously relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.574" offset="5318217">First place, we believe an excellent argument could now be made at the holdings in Moore versus Illinois Central and TWA versus Koppal which were writs and cases where a federal jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship have now been perhaps overruled although it's not necessary to reach that point in this case at least we believe in the proper case, those cases will have to be reexamined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.152" offset="5428558">The result seems implicit in the recent decision of this Court in IAM versus Central Airlines, an action arising under the laws of the United States in which it was held that federal and not state law controls in connection with matters involving the enforcement and interpretation of collective bargaining contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.147" offset="5516539">It's interesting to know that the Court there cited the Lucas Flour case decided under the Labor Management Relations Act on the point that the subject matter manifestly call for uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.781" offset="5579024">Certainly, the Moore doctrine should be examined -- it should be reexamined and certainly, we feel that the -- that a divergence of results bearing from state to state previously true at least under the Railway Labor Act is completely inconsistent with the policy of this Court established under the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.107" offset="5676408">Just for example, the Second Court -- the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in two cases has declined to follow the Moore doctrine in a wrongful discharge cases even under the Railway Labor Act, the Larsen case and the Satterfield cases cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.429" offset="5741714">The first of which cited the National Labor Policy developed under the Labor Management Relations Act in recent years and the second relying on the later decision of this Court in Pennsylvania Railroad versus Day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.337" offset="5805244">In addition, they -- both in decision in Mississippi which involved the same law interpreted in Moore versus Illinois as refused to follow at this date, Moore versus -- the doctrine of Moore versus Illinois in view of the later decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.537" offset="5874103">On the other hand, just last Thursday, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in McDonald versus the Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad did follow Moore versus Illinois but said that in -- that instance Moore versus Illinois should be limited specifically to the cause of action there presented a wrongful discharge case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.575" offset="5978279">And I think the theory there was it perhaps in a wrongful discharge case that the claimant may have other items of injury or other items of damage which he cannot find for redress or on the arbitration procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.086" offset="6044317">Certainly, this is not true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.736" offset="6054870">Under the arbitration procedure, if the plaintiff is entitled to severance pay, it's spelled out exactly what he gets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.052" offset="6088202">There is no other thing like damages for lawsuit, seniority rights, insurance, or pension rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.243" offset="6120908">Finally, in Pennsylvania Railroad versus Day the Court here has severely restricted the application of Moore versus Illinois to the unusual and specific situation of wrongful discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.824" offset="6187259">In the Slocum Enterprise cases the Court has justified the continued existence of the Moore doctrine on the basis of the special nature of a common law or statutory right for wrongful discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.724" offset="6250893">As I've said, feeling that perhaps in those cases, there might be a different type of remedy and a different type of damages not available under the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.977" offset="6291853">This is certainly not true in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.986" offset="6307944">Also, I think it's interesting to point out that in the instant case, the decision of the arbitrator is found and binding on all parties and I think the Moore versus Illinois Central doctrine may have been influenced by the beating of the Court that a decision of the National Railroad Adjustment Board was not binding and so far as the money award was concerned on the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.122" offset="6408464">And so, they said it's not unfair to say that the employee can go to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.353" offset="6433332">As a matter of fact, the Central Airline case which involved the question of a system board award which was found then binding is more analogous to the instant situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.749" offset="6486936">In any event, we respectively submit that there's no need to expand this doctrine which is already severely limited in its own field to the Labor Management Relations Act field and particularly in view of the clear cases in -- favoring the full enforceability of arbitration provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.958" offset="6583798">The conclusion, I just like to point out that we feel that the Supreme Court of Alabama fell into error because it had a too narrow concept of the entire collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.556" offset="6642207">It did not consider the role of arbitration as an essential part of the entire collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.243" offset="6672927">We feel that the plaintiff here in this case has attempted to obtain the benefits of the contract while rejecting the burdens of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.422" offset="6709603">And as Justice Brandeis said in one of the earliest cases involving the arbitration field where parties have agreed on arbitration, I think this was the Red Cross case that the substantive right of the parties to have that matter arbitrated, the disputes under that contract arbitrated is a perfect obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.749" offset="6786926">If the policy of the law governing the contract favors that right, we feel the intent of the parties should be followed.</text>
