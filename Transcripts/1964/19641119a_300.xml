            <label>Mr. E. Freeman Leverett</label>
            <text syncTime="13.002" offset="51931">Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.695" offset="62694">Yesterday I had just begun discussing the question of mootness and it endeavored to distinguish the line of election cases relied upon by the appellees on the ground that they are related to situations where an injunction was sought with respect to a particular election only, that election had been held in the meantime and therefore there was nothing thereafter that any court could to do to offset what have been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.730" offset="166870">I would like to discuss one of two other cases since we did not have an opportunity to file our brief in opposition to the motion then I will endeavor to answer the question posed by Mr. Justice Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.398" offset="221518">In J. I. Case Company versus National Labor Relations Board, 321 U.S. 332, the NLRB had issued an order which in effect prohibited the company from giving effect to individual contracts of employment that the company had secured with its employees prior to the time that a collective bargaining agent had been certified.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.504" offset="317962">The Court of Appeals rendered an enforcement order pending an appeal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.916" offset="343562">The individual contracts expired under their own terms and a collective bargaining agreement was entered into between the certified agent and the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.763" offset="394971">This Court refused to dismiss on the ground that the case was not moot because in the terms of the Court of the continuing character of the obligation imposed by the order and we think that is analogous here because in both cases orders have been rendered, the immediate application of which has been somewhat removed but which nevertheless imposed a continuing obligation in the future and will govern conduct showed a state of facts have arise to come under them.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="130.750" offset="522971">[Inaudible] to vacate that on the interim?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="e_freeman_leverett" startTime="135.133" stopTime="603.639">
            <label>Mr. E. Freeman Leverett</label>
            <text syncTime="135.133" offset="540526">No sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.077" offset="544287">They want to vacate it but not to reverse it or not to set it aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.147" offset="564558">In other words, they want it dismissed as moot which would not be an adjudication on the merits and which would still leave us with the prospect of a -- an injunction hanging over, should the State undertake to resubmit the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.935" offset="619729">I will discuss that in detail in momentarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.933" offset="631641">If I have an answer to your question at that time Mr. Justice Harlan I'll be glad to endeavor to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.487" offset="653897">Another case of some relevance is Leonard versus Earle which was a petition for mandamus to compel the issuance of an annual oyster license.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.569" offset="694230">The licensee had alleged that he had declined to agree to comply with one part of the requirements imposed by the licensing statute namely that he agreed to turn back 10% of all the oyster shells for reclamation and that he thought that was unConstitutional, pending an appeal the time for which the license was sought to expire, was an annual faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.644" offset="798511">This Court held nevertheless that the case was not moot in view of the fact that the proposed licensee represented that he had intended to remain in the oyster business and in that connection we have stated in our brief and I wish to reiterate it this time that the governor of Georgia is giving consideration to resubmitting the same Constitution either at the January 1965 session or at some special session.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.095" offset="916376">Another case, the Amalgamated Association versus Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, 340 U. S. 383 at 416, Mr. Justice Goldberg argued that case before this Court I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.663" offset="966635">Now that case was where an injunction had been issued under the Wisconsin Anti-Strike Law relating to public utilities, pending the injunction compulsory arbitration procedures will begin and award was rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.373" offset="1029433">Pending an appeal to the Court, the arbitration award was carried out, a motion was made to dismiss on the ground that the case was moot and this Court held that the mere fact that an order may have been obeyed below does not moot the case because it is still continuing in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.547" offset="1110100">Another case is NLRB versus Greyhound Lines in 303 U S. 261 at page 271, that was a case where the NLRB had issued a cease and desist order directing the employer from to quit giving recognition to a company dominated union and pending the appeal on enforcement order, another union was certified and a collective bargaining agreement was entered into between the employer and the union and this Court held that the mere fact that the order had been obeyed and the fact that its need was not so much now as it was at one time did not moot the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.008" offset="1280000">A case particularly significant, we think to this case is Southern Pacific Terminal Company versus Interstate Commerce Commission in 219 U. S. 498.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.367" offset="1325453">In that case, the Interstate Commerce Commission had issued a cease and desist order directing the carrier from giving or prohibiting the carrier from giving undue preferences to a specified shipper from and after November the 15th and for a period of two years following.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.343" offset="1393371">A suit was brought to set aside the order, and pending appeal that order expired of its own terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.316" offset="1421166">This Court held however that the case was not moot and distinguished the line of election cases relied upon by the appellees on the same ground that I have undertaken to do so but this Court used some language that is very pertinent we think to our case and that is quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.102" offset="1488353">“In the case at bar, the order of the Commission made to some extent the exact extent it is unnecessary to define, be the basis of future proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.622" offset="1522416">But there is a broader consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.328" offset="1533283">The question usually involved in the orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission are continuing as are ours, especially those in the case at bar and those considerations ought not to be as they might be defeated by short term orders capable of repetition yet evading review and at one time the government and in another time the carrier have their rights determined by the Commission without a chance of redress.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.987" offset="1627847">If all the experience in the field of reapportioning of a senate as any guide, we could well expect that if this Court should dismiss this appeal as being moot and under the Munsingwear case of course that would care whether the vacation of the -- an order below we could well expect a suit for injunction to be instituted shortly before the 1966 General Election at which time the Constitution could be resubmitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.457" offset="1741740">Under circumstances when this Court is in vacation we would have it no way of getting the determination of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.453" offset="1765773">We had the same thing in our senate reapportionment problem, we had suits filed on this countywide voting on multi-senate or multi-district counties and we had three cases in Fulton County and two in Chatham County and the cases in Fulton County were resolved against us and we didn't have time to get an appeal on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.710" offset="1850828">So, what we think is the effect of what is sought to be done here is not to dismiss a moot case, but to moot a case by dismissing and vacating and then putting us on a procedure called Sacro from which we cannot be extricated.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.157" offset="1920627">And moreover, we submit that the interest of the State of Georgia is more urgent here for regardless of the fact that a dismissal for mootness would carry with it a vacating of the judgment below, it does not alter the fact that is obvious to all that that remains unreversed on the merits a holding a decision by a United States District Court in Atlanta to the effect that the legislature is not empowered to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.904" offset="2035566">Now under those circumstances, the governor of Georgia is not in a position to contentiously resubmit or ask the legislature to reconsider.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.491" offset="2073913">We have already spent a million dollars on this special session that was called primarily for the purpose of Constitutional revision to have the principal product of that session set aside and with that judicial “Sword of Damocles” hanging over his head the governor could not in the very nature of things assumed the responsibility of asking the General Assembly to resubmit and go through all of the expense and time knowing that there still is although no technical order outstanding that is an opinion which is necessarily going to be controlling as I would come to momentarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.116" offset="2224379">This Court has gotten into this area by getting around or surmounting the obstacles of justiciability and lack of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.872" offset="2263458">But I think you must recognize that they are considerations present in this type of case which are not present in the ordinary traditional type of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.338" offset="2309329">The effect of an unreversed opinion of a court or holding of the Court has a very definite, it's very much alike to represent it as in to a political officers who are charged with making policies and they are certainly not going to run the risk again of being accused of spending all the time and money when they should have known that the Court has already ruled although technically there's no order outstanding.</text>

            <label>Justice Arthur J. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="603.639" offset="2414550">Do you think that you've been through also of the – whether this Court vacated it now, is that it?</text>

          <turn speaker="e_freeman_leverett" startTime="612.678" stopTime="690.315">

            <text syncTime="612.678" offset="2450704">I do not think sir that the legislature of the government either one could draw that nicer distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.793" offset="2483096">Now, if you reverse it there's no question then but to simply vacate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.380" offset="2505456">It does not alter the fact that a very responsible and highly respected Federal Court in Georgia has made a ruling and it's likely -- it very likely as a matter of course to make the same ruling if the case is presented to them again and Mr. Justice Goldberg I come to the point I think that perhaps deals with the question that you posed yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.443" offset="2581734">It's important to note here that the District Court below did not enjoin the submission of the proposed Constitution because of some particular substantive provision that this Constitution either had or did not have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.750" offset="2642965">The basis of the Court's decision below was that any Constitution proposed as this one was by legislature which it had concededly was malapportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.018" offset="2684029">Ipso facto and with that regard to looking at its countent had such vitiating biases built into it that the Court would enjoin its submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.308" offset="2721228">So consequently whether or not the 1965 General Assembly should change provisions is completely immaterial under the rationale of the Court's opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="697.175" offset="2788624">Now, the Act that I have, the thought that I have sought to convey is that the practical effect of a dismissal for mootness and a vacating of the judgment below is no different than if you had simply affirmed the injunction and declared it non-reviewable because the only contingency upon which this case would be moot would be that the legislature either sometime in 1965 either had the regular 45-day session or a special call session would not undertake to resubmit.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.710" offset="2922789">What I'm saying is that the procedure that is being sought to be in part here virtually assures that very thing coming about and it's a situation of where a dismissal is sought to moot a case rather than dismissing a case that is in fact moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.207" offset="2984751">Now there are three situations as I see it.</text>

            <text syncTime="815.126" offset="3260500">No sir, I think there is a little technicality there within that in that respect that I wish to discuss momentarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.310" offset="3297176">That brings me to the merits of the case enjoining the submission of the proposed Constitution the District Court below relied upon both federal considerations as to malapportionment and state considerations as to the proper procedure under the State Constitution and I would -- I feel little constrained to point out that we could take a literalistic interpretation of this Court decree and actually the legislature even though malapportioned in 1965 under the literal language could go ahead and resubmit the Constitution and when if you look at it from a purely literalistic standpoint we don't -- we wouldn't need any relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.360" offset="3461433">Well that's because of the impreciseness of language used in the decree which is framed in terms of placing the Constitution on the ballot rather than the legislature's passing it but we know what the Court means and the Court knows what it means and the appellees know what the Court means and we aren't trying to play “cat and mouse.”</text>
            <text syncTime="885.664" offset="3542622">We know that the whole thing, the whole thrust of the decree was the idea that has a malapportioned or a part of the malapportioned body undertaking to change the organic law of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.155" offset="3596539">Now at the outset we think it's important to point out that this is not a case where state has consistently evaded its Constitutional obligations by series of dilatory tactics which when the Court felt necessary to take drastic action in order to fraud a state into complying with its Constitutionally imposed mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.254" offset="3692983">When the District Court below ruled in May 1962 that one house had to be reapportioned, Georgia – said in about four or five months when this Court ruled in the Westbury case that have a congressional districts had to be reapportioned, that was done in a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.288" offset="3757140">Although in all fairness I think I should point out that the matter had been under consideration by the legislature for a couple of months before that.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.004" offset="3787964">So this is not a case where drastic remedies are indicated in order to compel the doing of something which has been the case recently in Oklahoma and also in the State of Washington where the Courts conceded the drastic remedies that they were employing well for the purpose of parting some action.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.193" offset="3860689">Secondly, this is not a case as I have previously pointed out where the Constitution has been enjoined because of some substantive provision that's contained in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.345" offset="3905306">The Court below was simply ruling that any Constitution has a conclusively presumed the rule of substantive law is defective if it's submitted by a malapportioned body.</text>

            <text syncTime="1103.057" offset="4412186">Now, it seems to me that the procedure that has been employed here does not alleviate a system of poor representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.930" offset="4447713">It substitutes no representation for admittedly some representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.442" offset="4469760">Stated differently, all the normal processes of state government to be hamstrung is the state to be practically put in a receivership pending the spirit of reapportion and more important than that it seems to me that we come down to the crux of it, assuming that it should what type of question is that, is it a policy of the question as to whether or not the legislature should be restrained in any particular area whether it relate to the Senate say passing on confirmations of nominations made by the governor, or the passing of certain legislation and making them certain appointments of a legislature -- a few opposition to have a state government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.867" offset="4635376">Those are policy of the questions which themselves should be made by either the people or by some representative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.867" offset="4667455">That brings in to focus the -- to the rationale relied upon by the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.995" offset="4687935">They place a reliance upon a Central Kentucky and Natural Gas Company versus Railroad Commission which stands for the proposition that a Federal Court can as a means of protecting the public interest pending compliance with its decrees impose conditions as the price of the lake or as the price of the certain relief that they are granted but its interesting to note that the case itself although recognizing that that principle existed held that the application of it in that case was not permissible because it was an effort in effect by the Court to invade the province of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.857" offset="4847386">The Youth State Utility Commission had issued a 45 cents per thousand feet rate for natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.563" offset="4882181">A suit was brought in Federal Court attacking that is being confiscatory under due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.597" offset="4902348">The District Court agreed and said we will issue an injunction on condition that you agree to refund ten cents of the 60-cent rate that you have yet to have been charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.776" offset="4951040">The case came to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.326" offset="4957205">This Court declared that while that rule was recognized that this was an effort by the District Court itself to write a rate which was a purely legislative function and that the jurisdiction had limitations inhered in the nature of the system which prevented the court from undertaking to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.689" offset="5038707">Now, ever since the dictum in Mississippi versus Johnson in which District Court refused to permit the State of Mississippi to file an original bill attacking the enforcement of the reconstruction acts by President Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.235" offset="5100878">It's been has been very well settled that courts will not enjoin legislative functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.735" offset="5122926">It was a dictum in that case, but in the later case of New Orleans Water Works case on 188 -- 164 U. S. 471 this Court enunciated in clear language the proposition that courts would not enjoin legislative functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.335" offset="5189277">The McCord case involving an effort to enjoin the making of rates while the rate-making process was going on, carried that further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.369" offset="5229401">Now these things come down with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.515" offset="5237969">None of these cases have delineated very clearly the rationale behind the rule that courts do not enjoin legislative processes, but Mr. Justice Harlan's decision in the New Orleans Water Works case referred to the mischievous consequences that would ensue and mentioned separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.427" offset="5317695">I think it comes down to this that separation of powers considerations its concept of justiciable controversy the fact that the legislative process might breakdown of its own accord as in this case that people might have rejected this proposed Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.991" offset="5383941">It's considerations of comity here with a Federal Court on the one hand and a state body on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.853" offset="5415393">Secondly, aside from these general considerations, we think that they are some peculiar to Georgia that shows that this particular relief should not have been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.723" offset="5458860">The Constitution of 1945 which is in existence now was submitted in the identically same fashion that the proposed 1964 Constitution was and yet the legislature that submitted the 1945 Constitution was much more malapportioned than the 1964 General Assembly which submitted the 1964 Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.251" offset="5548931">At the time of the submission of the 1945 Constitution the nine largest districts in the Senate and in the State having over 50% of the States population had only 16% of the Senate and yet the 1964 General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.743" offset="5610893">In that General Assembly the Senate and then the eight largest counties or nine largest counties in the State having 43% of the people had exactly 43% of the Senate , which is perfectly qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.223" offset="5664810">So we say that if you say that this 1964 Constitution could not stand what happens to our existing Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.127" offset="5696470">It was even more the product of a malapportioned body and its also significant to note in this context that much if perhaps not the majority of the agitation for Constitutional reform in Georgia came from the urban areas and looking at the proposed instrument, the 1964 provision, it is much more liberal in favor of municipalities in the metropolitan areas and it was the 1945 document contains broad powers of home rule, record transit, municipal parking systems, furnishing of municipal type said this is by counties and what is more significant for the first time in the history of our state a provision was written in to the 1945 Constitution permitting cities to share in the automatic Constitutional allocation of road funds derived from motor fuel tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.627" offset="5910465">There's no question that the 40th, -- that the 1964 Constitution was much more favorable to municipalities than the 1945 laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.335" offset="5953306">This brings me down and I might point out here that the reason for Constitutional reform in Georgia has been the unusual specificity in detail above the existing Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.176" offset="6000640">Since 1945 we've had approximately 500 amendments to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.500" offset="6017985">This 1964 General Election, we had a 103 local amendments alone in one election and 14 general amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.419" offset="6053616">The ballot in Georgia sometimes reaches monstrous proportions because of the statutory detail above our Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1603.992" offset="6415882">The idea being that it would be better to leave it in general terms so that if Constitutional doctrine changes, we wouldn't be frozen in with something that we couldn't change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.298" offset="6457156">In enjoining the submission of the proposed Constitution, the District Court relied not only upon considerations of malapportionment but also upon its own interpretation to the effect that this proposed amending procedure was not valid under the State Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.049" offset="6524134">The procedure employed in adopting or ratifying the 1945 Constitution was identical to that being pursued here within three steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.145" offset="6560496">The tracking of the instrument by a Constitutional revision Commission created by statute, some of the members of which were appointed by the Governor, others of which were simply ex-official named in the resolution itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.877" offset="6615458">The submission to an approval of that draft and -- with changes by the legislature, by two-thirds of vote of both houses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1666.073" offset="6664255">Now the existing Constitutional provisions governing amendment procedures for all practical purposes here were identical, under the Constitution in effect at the time the 1945 document was ratified and those in effect now under which the 64th document was ratified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.551" offset="6738129">That similarity in both Constitutional procedure and in Constitutional provisions makes relevant, a case decided by the Georgia Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="5411.114" offset="21644434">There's no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5412.521" offset="21650077">You have no other alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="5413.978" offset="21655824">It's a matter of just being an Article III Court, I think the question of mootness goes to justiciable controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5420.997" offset="21683931">On the other hand, if the case is not by its facts moot, we -- there was a protest to any court vacating a judgment not on the merits but simply in order to have the effect of a voting review.</text>
            <text syncTime="5434.687" offset="21738684">And it seems to us that what is, when in fact what is sought to be done not purposely, not obviously, the court below and the counsel here are honorable people but the effect in this context, it seems to me is no different than if for example, a lower court want to issue an injunction and every time after he had had expended it's force at a crucial time and after it got in the appellate court, the lower court would vacate it not on the merits but on some technical grounds so to defeat the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5463.136" offset="21852473">We could continue that ad infinitum.</text>
            <text syncTime="5465.147" offset="21860519">And that is we think -- that is what we think in this particular situation is.</text>
