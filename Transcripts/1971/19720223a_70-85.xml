            <label>Mr. Edgar A. Zingman</label>
            <text syncTime="28.945" offset="190227">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.509" offset="204437">We appear here on behalf of the petition of Paul Branzburg, a professional journalist employed by the Courier Journal, a daily newspaper published in Louisville, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.388" offset="251980">The petitioner seeks reversal on First and Fourteenth Amendment ground of two cases decided by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, in the first of these, involving the Respondent Hayes, a Judge in the Trial Court in Jefferson County, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.278" offset="327526">Following upon publication in the Courier Journal of an article authored by the petitioner, which described the manufacture of hashish by two individuals in Louisville, Kentucky, in which in the body of the article contained the statement, that a promise had been given by the petitioner that the identity of the two individuals would be maintained confidential, and would not be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.786" offset="429508">The petitioner was subpoenaed before a grand jury, sitting in Jefferson County, Kentucky, and was asked by that asked by that grand jury two questions relating to the identity of the person that he had described in a newspaper article.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.245" offset="503383">One of the questions asked him specifically, "On November 12 or 13, 1969, who was the person or persons you observed in possession of marijuana about which you wrote an article in the Courier Journal on November 15, 1969?"</text>
            <text syncTime="126.972" offset="582272">The second question was, "On November 13, 1969, who was the person or persons you observed compounding marijuana producing same to a compound known as hashish?"</text>
            <text syncTime="141.498" offset="640369">This appears in our appendix at page 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.212" offset="655206">The petitioner refused to answer these questions, and was brought before the predecessor in office of the respondent Hayes, a Trial Judge by the name of Pound, and upon the questions being read to the judge, the petitioner was directed to answer the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.346" offset="739739">At that time we appeared in behalf of the petitioner and asserted First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds under the concept of Freedom of the Press for the petitioner’s refusal to answer the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.106" offset="806821">We also asserted the provisions of a Kentucky shield statute, KRS, Kentucky Revised statutes 421.100, which is phrased in language that protects a newsman from revealing the source of any information published by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.883" offset="885920">The Trial Court rejected the contentions made on behalf of the petitioner, and various motions for writs of prohibition and for stays were made in the Kentucky Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.632" offset="936911">The Kentucky Court of Appeals granted a temporary stay prohibiting the respondent’s predecessor in office from proceeding with contempt action against the petitioner, until such time as the Kentucky Court of Appeals had occasion to pass on the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.389" offset="1019980">The case was subsequently briefed and argued to the Kentucky Court of Appeals on the First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds, in addition to the provisions of the Kentucky Shield statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.489" offset="1064388">In November of 1970, the Kentucky Court of Appeals delivered an opinion, in which the Kentucky Court of Appeals held that the Kentucky shield statue did not protect the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.862" offset="1125828">It held that the shield’s statute was restricted solely to informants, information and protected the identity of informants, but where the reporter, or newsman observed at firsthand individuals engaged in a particular activity which might cause to the crime or any activity, he was not privileged to protect the identity of the individuals themselves, a position which seems to us to put a premium on second hand reporting and second hand sources somewhat incongruously.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.070" offset="1278697">Shortly after the Kentucky Court of Appeals opinion was delivered, a petition for reconsideration was filed in the Kentucky Court of Appeals, calling to that Court’s attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.519" offset="1320493">The fact that they had made no comment upon our First and Fourteenth Amendment arguments, and citing to the Kentucky Court of Appeals the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Caldwell against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.144" offset="1370961">The appeal of which was argued before this Court yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.531" offset="1388516">While that was pending before the Kentucky Court of Appeals, another article authored by the petitioner, appeared in the Courier Journal, and this article dealt with the use and sale of marijuana in the State Capitol Buildings in Frankfort, Kentucky and the environs of the Capitol Buildings in Frankfort.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.983" offset="1478377">Immediately following the publication of this article, the petitioner was subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury in Franklin County, Kentucky and the subpoena stated, "To testify in the matter of violation of statutes concerning the use and sale of drugs."</text>
            <text syncTime="370.931" offset="1558103">A motion to quash this subpoena was made on First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds, and the Trial Court, the Respondent Meigs entered an order, which in effect overruled the contentions we made directing the petitioner to appear before the Franklin County Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.013" offset="1642426">At that time, we contended not only that testimony with relation to the article was privileged under the First and Fourteenth Amendment, but we contended that the mere appearance of the petitioner under this subpoena was protected against under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.085" offset="1722779">The Trial Court having overruled us on this position, we appealed for relief to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which had our petition for reconsideration in the first case still pending before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.087" offset="1770739">The Kentucky Court of Appeals refused us the relief, which we had requested, entered a modified opinion in the first case upon our petition for reconsideration, which in essence modified the first opinion by adding a footnote contending that we had abandoned our First and Fourteenth Amendment claims in the argument in the Kentucky Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.120" offset="1866870">A position which I might say, I think was a distortion of the record and which has not been urged in this Court in the briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="545.350" offset="2255781">Following upon Judge Meigs’ action as I stated the Court of Appeals, entered its modified opinion in the Hayes case, and denied us the relief we asked in the Meigs case.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.790" offset="2325580">It subsequently followed this with an opinion in the Meigs case which is at present unreported, but is set out in the appendix at page 54, and in substance in that opinion, they rejected our First and Fourteenth Amendment arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.279" offset="2387543">They took the position that a newsman occupies no position different from any other citizen in the community, and they specifically rejected the holding of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in the Caldwell decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.921" offset="2458073">We asked for stays and engaged in various procedural moves to hold up action pending application for certiorari to this Court, this was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.411" offset="2500078">And upon application, Mr. Justice Stewart granted a temporary injunction staying any further compulsion or contempt proceedings against the petitioner pending application for certiorari, and on May 3 1971, certiorari was granted and we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.227" offset="2583356">With the indulgence of the Court, I would first like to state the issue and the proposition we urge, and then to develop our arguments and support of that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.174" offset="2639050">In the sense that these cases seek relief for a newsman from compulsory testimony under certain circumstances, they are cases of first impression in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.389" offset="2691921">They are here as was the Caldwell case yesterday, and the Pappas case which follows us, because of a distressingly increasing practice of the entire criminal administration apparatus, grand juries, prosecutors, investigators, to attempt to make the news media into an appendage of that apparatus by compelling newsmen to give testimony relating to that confidential sources and information.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.762" offset="2797456">Doctrinally however, these are not cases of first impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.969" offset="2814279">We are asking here only for that historical protection against governmental interference with exercise of First Amendment rights, which this Court has always provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.970" offset="2862240">While the factual setting may be novo, these cases seek nothing more than the application here of these Court’s salutary and off repeated requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.078" offset="2902677">That there is imposed upon the government the burden of demonstrating a compelling and overriding need, and the lack of alternatives less destructive of First Amendment rights before government interference with the exercise of First Amendment rights will be countenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.701" offset="2969237">The rule that we urge upon the Court, is that the freedom of the press guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments encompasses not only publication, but all meaningful preconditions to publication, not the least of which is the ability to gather or obtain information.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.979" offset="3042276">To ensure these rights, we believe that it is necessary for this Court to declare that the First Amendment protects a newsman from being compelled to enter a closed proceeding and from being compelled to disclose confidential information obtained by him as a newsman, unless there has been a prior demonstration by the government in an open hearing of a compelling and overriding need for the disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.315" offset="3151676">Now, while we do not believe that the test of compelling and overriding need can be or should be precisely defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.326" offset="3183755">We suggest that as a minimum, the following consideration should be weighed, but none alone should be treated as controlling.</text>

            <text syncTime="810.036" offset="3314576">Firstly, let me comment that the definition of a newsman as such while we will offer one, is should not be a problem as the Court will recall in the whole line of litigation starting with Sullivan against the New York Times, we had to, and the Court had to deal with the definition of the public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.864" offset="3425858">And we moved from public official in Sullivan with the footnote that the Court does not here define how far this reaches in the government structure to public person, to a person of prominence, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.221" offset="3479252">Unless, of course, this is what the Courts are peculiarly and aptly fitted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.404" offset="3495970">And we submit that the same thing with the newsman, but as a starting point, we would define a newsman as any person who want to continue as basis, is engaged in the process of gathering information and preparing such information for the dissemination to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.065" offset="3582697">That is a very simplistic definition, but we think it would be a good starting place within the traditional approach of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2422.689" offset="9765149">I think the records demonstrate very clearly the chilling effect upon the newsman’s ability to operate that these subpoenas, and compelling testimony induces.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.569" offset="9824708">The inevitable conclusion that we believe is the case, is that the newsman is entitled under the First Amendment to refuse to disclose confidential material, and to appear in a closed proceeding under compulsion, unless there has been a prior demonstration in an open hearing by the government of a compelling and overriding need for compulsory disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.150" offset="9930974">And we have suggested three criteria to be applied in determining whether or not there is such a compelling and overriding need, none of which we suggest is to be controlling, but we strongly urge upon the Court that in the historic line of cases, which have preserved and enhanced First Amendment rights in the process of bringing about that robust and wide open debate, which this Court has noted, in preserving an untrammeled press, that the necessity for declaring these First Amendment rights is immediate and urgent, and that it comes at very slight cost to the prosecutorial apparatus to the criminal administration apparatus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.302" offset="10131595">Whereas, the reverse was noted yesterday by Mr. Amsterdam in his argument, every newsman interviewed in the particular survey has said that it would be a disaster for the newsman to operate in the face of a declaration by this Court, that confidential sources could not be protected.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="4637.436" offset="18624108">You said the guidelines are based on a recognition "of limiting effects on the exercise of First Amendment rights."</text>

            <label>Mr. William Bradford Reynolds</label>
            <text syncTime="4647.071" offset="18662664">Your Honor, I think we all recognize that when we’re talking about newsgathering that in the penumbra of First Amendment interest, there is lurking somewhere an interesting news gathering.</text>
            <text syncTime="4664.918" offset="18734031">I don’t think that there’s much doubt if the government were to cut off all access to a particularly impoverished area, for example, solely for the reason that they do not want the public to know what was going on there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.569" offset="18788679">That would be permissible under the First Amendment, but newsgathering is an exceedingly broad concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.790" offset="18821593">And as this Court recognized in Zemel and Rusk, in many respects, it connotes action more than expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.194" offset="18859210">I think plainly, one does not have any constitutional right to access to a particular newsworthy stories, or newsworthy items.</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.373" offset="18903931">I for instance, don’t think that as a matter of constitutional law, a news reporter could gain access to a White House conference, or a conference in the Supreme Court, for example, because it might be a newsworthy story.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.951" offset="18958161">Moreover, and this has been pointed out in prior questions and answers before the Court, newsgathering as a First Amendment interest, is not an interest that is only with the institutionalized press or the news reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4738.444" offset="19028170">I think that any citizen, any individual who is concerned with exchanging ideas or disseminating information to others, whether he be a news reporter, an author, a freelance writer, a professor, has the same interest in the First Amendment in newsgathering, nor in my view is it confined to the written word, or publication I think as Mr. Justice Rehnquist pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.494" offset="19168395">The lecturer or the public debater, or any individual citizen who wish to exchange ideas or information with friends or associates, would have the same interest in gathering news.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.477" offset="19232343">I don’t think it’s an exclusive interest that we find in the free press language of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4797.741" offset="19265361">I think it is also inherent in free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.377" offset="19279885">And it is our view, that as a matter of constitutional theory, if we’re going to construct a privilege based on a First Amendment interest in newsgathering, that that privilege is going to have to pertain, not just to news reporters, but to anybody who says that in appearance before a Grand Jury is going to have a chilling effect on his confidential sources of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.720" offset="19401303">And there’s an additional difficulty that in those circumstances, there is an additional difficulty on how to determine or verify confidentiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.519" offset="19444457">That’s one of those factors that Court by its nature is going to be unable to scrutinize.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.389" offset="19483954">Our position is essentially, that to allow this type of wholesale interference, and it would be wholesale interference with the grand jury, is contrary and undercuts the specific protections that the framers of the constitution intended by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.399" offset="19572039">The Fifth Amendment provides that a Grand Jury shall be the sole method for preferring charges in serious criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.280" offset="19619477">Our grand jury is modeled after the English grand jury, has a body of laymen with very broad powers to investigate in secret, alleged criminal acts not only for determining probable guilt, but also for the purpose of protecting innocent people of false prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4912.397" offset="19723967">From the early days of the republic, and indeed in England, attendance upon and testimony before grand jury has been a public duty for which every citizen is bound to perform when summoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4933.128" offset="19806932">We don’t think that the framers of the constitution were unaware of this obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.284" offset="19831487">Nor do we think they were unaware of the fact, as has been pointed out already in prior discussion this morning, that anybody who’s called before a grand jury, is going to have some adverse effect on First Amendment interests, either speech, or associational ties, or press.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.028" offset="19934514">But the area of this potential conflict is an exceedingly narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.210" offset="19951232">It’s an area that deals only with question of criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.444" offset="19972130">And in that narrow area, we think that the framers of the constitution, in reconciling the broad public interest in having a grand jury with these broad investigatorial powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.831" offset="20037750">And the First Amendment interest that might be indirectly affected, by calling in people to appear before grand juries, that they apparently determine that there should be no alternation of the general requirement, that people appear and give testimony before grand juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="5015.090" offset="20134716">Now they did write an exception into the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5019.905" offset="20154047">The exception against self-incrimination, but there is no exception written into the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5031.626" offset="20200859">We think that the very direct effect that is possible on First Amendment interest that is interest of speech and association, which are in our view far more direct First Amendment interest, than what we are talking about here which is a more remote interest in newsgathering.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.777" offset="20285495">But the effect on those direct interest by appearing before the grand jury, where we think not unforeseen by the framers, and they do not see fit to rate any privilege into the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5067.525" offset="20344532">And we don’t believe that this more remote interest in terms of newsgathering is one that would require that we now create a new privilege in the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5090.415" offset="20436065">Now, we’ve heard a lot this morning about the fact that a holding by this Court the effect that there is no privilege in the First Amendment is going to dry up news sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="5108.046" offset="20506596">The news media in this country have of course existed for almost 200 years without a constitutional privilege of the sort of thing there is to hear.</text>

            <text syncTime="5217.375" offset="20943885">As far as the drawing up of the sources, this claim, we might point out, is being made by a certain segment of the media, by in these cases, essentially the large metropolitan newspapers, by amicus briefs the large major TV networks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5243.303" offset="21047644">And that Professor Blazy’s (ph) report that has been referred to yesterday, talks also in terms of as his study group compiled newspapers with a circulation of over 50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="5259.065" offset="21110651">How often conceivably, it might be demonstrated that a reporter’s privilege is desirable for that segment of the media.</text>
            <text syncTime="5270.550" offset="21156627">It may well not be desirable on balance to the right such protection for newspapers with as smaller circulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5278.352" offset="21187765">There may be no problem of drawing up of new sources, or drawing up of new stories, I’m revealing with the smaller segment of the smaller circulation, or what about newsletters for example, college newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5300.426" offset="21276059">We think that if there is really a difficulty with respect to drawing up the sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.896" offset="21313988">And we point out again that the news media have enabled to exist for 200 years without any constitutional privilege, and without a drawing up of sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="5321.442" offset="21360173">But if there is a difficulty along those lines, we think that it’s for the legislature to determine on an informed judgment, looking at the different particular problems with respect to different media, and to meet that difficulty in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5342.553" offset="21444601">We don’t believe that the right approach is a constitutional privilege that is to be confined to a particular class of citizenry that is news reporters as such.</text>

            <text syncTime="5367.395" offset="21543970">To our knowledge, this Court has never recognized in the First Amendment or in any other Amendment in the Bill of Rights, any special rights or privileges that apply to a special class of citizen, and we do not think that it would be appropriate to do so here.</text>

            <text syncTime="5399.433" offset="21672179">Mr. Chief Justice, thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="5402.130" offset="21682942">I would briefly point out, Mr. Justice Rehnquist; you asked the question about the abandonment of the First and Fourteenth Amendment claims in the Kentucky Court of Appeals, and Mr. Schroering.</text>
            <text syncTime="5413.987" offset="21730380">I believe in error stated that the contention was that in oral argument, I had abandoned that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5419.958" offset="21754204">That’s not what the record discloses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5421.492" offset="21760369">The record discloses that the Court of Appeals claimed that in a supplemental memorandum which I filed with them, I had abandoned that claim by a statement which I made that there is no question here concerning the First Amendment concerning the issue of privilege itself, we have a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5443.118" offset="21846886">We dealt with this preposition in our replied brief on the application for writ of certiorari that was taken out of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="5449.760" offset="21873427">It was in response to an argument based upon Professor Wigmore’s writings on privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="5455.316" offset="21895683">But in any event, even if there was a technical abandonment in the Meigs case, they specifically rejected the First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.804" offset="21925567">As this Court has noted it would be a fruitless exercise to send us back, have the petitioner make his assertion, be held in contempt and we’d be right here because we know what the Kentucky Court of Appeals would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5474.154" offset="21971020">Now, the Solicitor General has referred in his argument to the Attorney General’s guidelines in response to your question from Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5486.544" offset="22020548">I would point out that first of all, as Mr. Justice Douglas recognized, and as I think the Court was recognized because the Solicitor General states it in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5494.870" offset="22053881">This is a very delicate area, recognized by the Federal Government, but then the Solicitor General in his brief says that the Attorney General’s guidelines do not create any litigable rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5505.720" offset="22097244">So what we have is, in the federal area, a statement of policy, but at the same time the Solicitor General tells us that if they decide not to follow it, that’s their judgment and no rights, are conferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.366" offset="22155863">We’re talking about First Amendment rights and as Mr. Reynolds indicated, we are talking about the penumbra of rights, and we suggest that under the penumbra, this right is necessary of declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5534.941" offset="22214168">Now in this entire argument this morning, and to some extent yesterday, there seem to be some implicit assumption that compulsory testimonies an absolute absent of Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="5551.522" offset="22280519">Well, that’s just not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5553.639" offset="22288983">To begin with, we have on the Government side, the asserted right of the Government not provided any place in the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5560.870" offset="22317926">Not to disclose the identity of informants in criminal proceedings and that’s been protected by judicial decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="5629.961" offset="22594197">Then I would pass finally to this 200-year argument which I eluded to in my argument earlier, and that is we don’t know what the situation might have been, had the Court declared this First Amendment penumbra right that we urge, somewhat earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.938" offset="22670161">We don’t know to what extent the press has been denied information, but we do know in the record in the Caldwell case, in the Branzburg affidavit, which is part of the record in our case, the present effect of a denial of this privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.838" offset="22729721">We have already seen situations, and the Caldwell Judge himself, as I think has been noted in some of the supplemental briefs and proceedings following upon Caldwell applying the same guidelines, has compelled the disclosure of testimonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.947" offset="22794191">So the guidelines themselves were too narrow to extend any significant protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="5687.295" offset="22823552">Further, I would point out that we’re dealing with a new breed of newsman today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5691.548" offset="22840584">With the advent of television, and the on the spot coverage that the television newscaster provides, more and more our daily newspapers are going into in-depth reporting, investigative reporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.524" offset="22892516">And this is an entirely different situation, and does deal with the sensitive groups where information is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="5711.627" offset="22920937">I would just conclude an urge upon you that the penumbra area of the First Amendment requires the declaration here the rights we urge.</text>

            <text syncTime="5729.066" offset="22990632">Suppose the prosecutor upon reading this story or the foreman of the grand jury, if there was a grand jury then sitting as I gather there is in the larger cities of Kentucky, concluded that this was one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5751.462" offset="23080284">Either the story was true and the local police department was not alert enough, or the story was a hoax, and a fabrication, and a fraud, and the pictures were flagellant with actors and not real people, and that the powder was baking soda and not hashish.</text>
            <text syncTime="5781.318" offset="23199716">And so, as foreman of the Grand Jury, I must make it the foreman of the grand jury, he said he wanted to find out which was true.</text>
            <text syncTime="5788.304" offset="23227614">Now, would you think there is an important public interest to be served in finding out which of these two things is true, namely is the police department falling down or is it in league with these people on the one hand, or is this just a fabricated news story completely made up out of the whole cloth?</text>

            <text syncTime="5820.337" offset="23355719">The gain to the community in that one instance as weighed against the situation that we posed, that denial of the privilege would lead to the overall effect of denying the entire community, the flow of information that I would sacrifice, in this case, the gain of that information about that specific situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5843.378" offset="23447879">I think, if we don’t do that, then we’re cutting off the flow of information to serve this one immediate purpose.</text>
