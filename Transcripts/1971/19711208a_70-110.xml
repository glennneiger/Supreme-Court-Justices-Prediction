            <text syncTime="11.481" offset="120007">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.971" offset="137979">The respondents, here are members of the Old Order Amish religious sect.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.287" offset="159191">They reside in Green County of Southwestern Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.937" offset="177790">In November of 1968, when they refused to send their children beyond the eighth grade, a summon and criminal complaint was filed in the County Court of Green County.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.062" offset="230348">They were tried on April 2, 1969 for violation of the Wisconsin compulsory school-attendance law.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.224" offset="267024">The case was tried to the County Court of Green County and the respondents were found guilty there.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.101" offset="290534">They had a trial de novo in the Circuit Court of Green County where the Court again found them guilty and imposed a minimum fine of $5.00 on each of the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.331" offset="335360">They appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.373" offset="347586">The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed and this Court granted certiorari on May 24th of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.580" offset="380396">Respondents object to education of the children in public, private, secular or non-secular schools beyond a certain point.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.110" offset="430551">At present time, the objection is eighth grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.944" offset="445911">The Trial Court noted the problem with the arbitrary eighth grade cutoff in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.422" offset="479765">Now, worried about the decisions and opinions that were filed in this case in the courts below, the Trial Court below found that the compulsory school attendance law did interfere with the freedom of the respondents to act in support of their religious beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.349" offset="575478">They also found that appreciable numbers of the Amish-reared youth do believe the faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.810" offset="613303">Both the Trial Courts concluded after several careful consideration of the cases that the compulsory school-attendance laws in Wisconsin were a reasonable exercise of the police power of the state to educate its youth.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.578" offset="920399">Yes, there is an area of discretion there to be exercised by the State Superintendent of the Public Instruction, Your Honor and this provides for a certain unusual cases and of course there are exemptions for a health problems and handicaps and that sort of thing, but there is no problem with respect to the substantial equivalency of the education, the discretion resting with the State Superintendent of the Public Instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.110" offset="1058534">Now, the opinions of the Wisconsin Court were three in number.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.101" offset="1086538">There is principal opinion which is stated on page 133 of the appendix, we view this case as involving solely a parents’ right of religious freedom to bring up his children as he believe God dictates.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.476" offset="1200014">If nothing else, that God dictates in an infinite variety of ways, this makes for a thoroughly broad issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.186" offset="1246825">The concurring opinion has stated this.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.848" offset="1277440">Under the facts of this case there has been an inadequate showing that the state's interest in establishing and maintaining an educational system overrides the defendants’ right to the pre-exercise of his religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.070" offset="1610345">Now, the agricultural vocational schools which would probably interest the Amish more is handled through the land grant, the old federal aid program to agricultural education and that is handled in the high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.975" offset="1710028">There is a special agricultural teacher who is paid out of federal funds and that has been in existence for a long time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1354.195" offset="5490887">And to this extent, the ruling of the Wisconsin Court does present a constitutional right to anyone who has conscientious objection based on a sincere moral belief to object to education.</text>

            <text syncTime="1391.606" offset="5640516">There is a correlation expressed in Prince against Massachusetts, a correlation for example between compulsory education and compulsory school attendance and the child labor laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="1426.076" offset="5778338">The matter in which a juvenile judge for example deals with a dependent child would be affected by the decision of this Court and if it were to say that there is a constitutional right to conscientiously object education, I feel that it would be removing a vital tool from the administration of a law as it relates to youth and children.</text>

            <label>Mr. William B. Ball</label>
            <text syncTime="1560.472" offset="6315938">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.924" offset="6333806">Wisconsin Attorney General’s attempt to have these Amish parents found criminally guilty has now entered into the fourth year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.947" offset="6373826">This in spite of the fact that in January of this year, the Supreme Court of the State by a six to one vote tendered two conclusions and I am quoting out from the concurring opinion, “that there has been an inadequate showing that the state’s interest in establishing and maintaining an educational system overrides defendant’s right to free exercise of religion” and secondly, “that Amish should not be required to attend the school which meets the requirements of state law beyond the eighth grade.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.817" offset="6489392">And even the one dissenting opinion that of Mr. Justice Heffernan talks about how this prosecution came to be triggered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.545" offset="6524291">So there is strong evidence that the purpose of this prosecution was not to further the compelling interest of the state in education, rather a reprehensible objective under the facts of this case to force the Amish into school only for the purpose of qualifying for augmented state age.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.990" offset="6590015">I am going to tax the Court by going over just a little bit some of the facts as they have been presented because I think they are basic, from hearing the questions that have been asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.221" offset="6630975">The legal basis for this prosecution is the refusal of these parents on religious grounds to afford the three children in question at most two years of high school under a statute which requires not a high school course, not four years of high school, not even one year necessarily but merely school through age 15 not through age 16, through age 15 according to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.160" offset="6766707">Now, the state interest becomes a little bit varied when we think in terms of compelling state interest because if there is a VOs or the technical school, vocational school in the school district then the age limit is 18, up to 18 the child is to attend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.525" offset="6828147">A different standard applies where there is no VO school and the record in this case establishes that there was no vocational school in this district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.257" offset="6875063">Now, then in terms of the interest the state has been trying to compel these children to attend school beyond the eighth grade, we have to realize that for Frieda Yoder, the daughter of Jonas Yoder, one of the three children in question, only one year of schooling was involved because she was 15 years and five months old on the day the criminal complaint was brought against her father.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.734" offset="6969000">Barbara Miller would have only six months of the state benefit of additional compulsory education because she was 15 years and eight months old at the time the criminal complaint was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.763" offset="7017169">Now, it is the position of the Amish parents that the application of the statute to them violates their free exercise of religion and that there has been no showing whatever, no showing at all that non-application of the statute to them violates or creates any substantial danger to any interest of the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.762" offset="7121137">Nobody on our side challenges the fact that the compulsory attendance laws as we speak a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.878" offset="7153633">We have merely, in fact emphasized in this case and in our defense, it is our whole sole support of the statement of this Court in Brown versus the Board of Education wherein the Court said education is a principle instrument in awakening the child's cultural values and preparing them for later professional training and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.824" offset="7241405">This is a superb description of what the Amish people believe in terms of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.112" offset="7262512">My argument, may it please the Court, will pursue two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.827" offset="7281424">One the pre-exercise claim and secondly the question of danger to interest of the state which the State of Wisconsin has said existence of substantially degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.066" offset="7334400">The free exercise point is extremely important that is it is extremely important, but I will try to develop this at some length because here we are not talking about one tenet of the religion being at stake, for example observance of the Sabbath or opposition to military training.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.355" offset="7415485">We are not talking here about one particular practice, say spreading the gospel through speech or press or simply as a period of a number of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.962" offset="7453937">We are not talking about one forced exercise such as the salute to a greater image or recitation of papers or bible reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.372" offset="7487583">We are talking about a whole complex of religious interests, religious interests and rights in education and worship and parental nurture, an individual religious choice in vocation, in communal association with respect to teaching and learning with respect to privacy as we have tried to spell out in our brief and indeed we are talking about as will appear the continued existence of the Amish faith community in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.682" offset="7600849">In Graver versus Kansas, Kansas versus Graver rather, the only other State Supreme Court decision in point various Kansas' attention was paid to the actualities of the Amish religious claim, and therefore, we are dwelling on that to some extent here this morning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1971.092" offset="7958414">They go back to a time in the sixteenth century Mr. Justice Stewart when a number of people of the Protestant Reformation sought to return to what they believe to be the Golden Age of Christianity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.714" offset="8028944">In the early centuries of Christianity and reject the institutional churches of the Catholic Church and the other Protestant Churches and to do this, and to have that life, they believe that their lives had to be governed completely by the Sermon on the Mount and this would be therefore the cult of the creating of a community of love, of mutual health, of simplicity, closeness to nature, animals, soil, plants and so on turning the other cheek, and extremely importantly, perhaps the most critical point in the understanding of the Amish religion, separation from the world is they believe was not only the practical means whereby this light could be lit, but was also a means, a principle enjoined upon them by the Gospels themselves for St. Paul’s speaks and says, do not be conformed to this world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.580" offset="8268435">This is a basic doctrine of Amish religious teaching and so therefore they in two ways have sought to separate themselves in the world and have maintained this over the centuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.007" offset="8318067">First of all, they see that there has to be a separation from what they consider, pride of intellect, that is to say the higher learning as they express it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2344.172" offset="9450737">We attempted a negotiation for them to avoid having any kind of Court case and these attempts were rejected out of hand as I think the supplemental appendix very clearly reveals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2363.558" offset="9528268">The Amish do not want their children and they do not want themselves to be exposed to the spirit of luxury, lust, temptation, of strife, consumerism, competition, speed, violence, and other such elements, as are commonly found in our American way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.613" offset="9592529">Therefore education for them embraces a rejection of the higher learning and a positive emphasis upon learning of the agriculture life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.308" offset="9643312">It rejects the concept of exposure to and service in the ways of the world and when you add to this, the factor of adolescence you will see why an Amish person whether we would agree with him or not may not in a religious point of view attend school beyond the eighth grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.049" offset="9722306">That factor of adolescence is extremely basic in Amish religious thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.289" offset="9743204">It is the time which leads to adult baptism.</text>

            <text syncTime="2431.833" offset="9801405">The Amish religion forbids high school then because of those three elements, a tremendous stress on the importance of the opportunity which adolescence creates.</text>

            <text syncTime="2561.330" offset="10319360">The Amish placed a tremendous importance of task coming to adolescence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2675.659" offset="10776712">In the high school level it would be a very much broader mix and at the time of high school the child is then in the Amish religion being prepared for a complete vocation in Amish life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.675" offset="10820807">And this is extremely disrupted to that vocation and secondly, it is a time in life when exposures to these elements are going to have a very serious impact upon his values.</text>

            <label>Mr. William B. Ball</label>
            <text syncTime="2738.496" offset="11028115">I think it is quite a close analogy Mr. Chief Justice Burger and I think that is well brought out by the way in the brief of the -- brief amicus curiae in this case by the Synagogue Council of America and other related Jewish groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.034" offset="11094257">The –- I would like to comment if I may with the time that remains to discuss the danger would strike which a state has said it is faced with, if these Amish children for religious reasons are permitted to not attend school through age 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.083" offset="11226436">One has to ask whether the state with its very ample legal research resources, why they never placed a single witness on the stand produce any documentary evidence at all once rapid with any study which would give color to the charge that Amish non-attendance threatens some compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.478" offset="11315984">All the evidence on that point of compelling state interest came to the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.733" offset="11336987">State offered really two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.875" offset="11345555">First of all that Amish non-attendance, two years, one year, six months, whatever it might be threatens of all things the states establishing and maintaining an educational system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.447" offset="11391844">Six judges below and the Wisconsin Supreme Court denied this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.255" offset="11415145">Certainly, here there is no danger of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.871" offset="11429565">Very few people could show what the Amish have shown that is to say a unique and ancient religious tradition and religious claim that the obvious nurture and protection of children which takes place in the Amish community which treasures children, the whole factor of training in life that are useful and productive vocation and no casting of the children upon the community, certainly here there is far less danger at all or disturbance of a system that was found in Sherbert versus Verner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.645" offset="11564670">No one else’s rights are harmed by virtue of Amish none attendance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.083" offset="11586404">And here I am reminded of the statement of Mr. Justice Brennan in dissenting in Braunfeld when he said that values of the First amendment looked primarily towards preservation of personal liberty rather than toward fulfillment of collective goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.960" offset="11649934">Here we have precisely that put in the scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.323" offset="11667383">The collective goal is not going to be disturbed by the fact that these children did not attend school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.979" offset="11697999">Additionally, that I have to reinforce what Mr. Calhoun said a few moments ago when he pointed to the Court the findings of the Trial Court, the finding of the Circuit Court and the determination by the State Supreme Court that could be exercised of the Amish religion was patently here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.902" offset="11789741">That the state’s action enforcing these children into high school constitutes a denial of the free exercise of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.791" offset="11821297">This I think is established in the case irrespective of what may be brought at the Amish religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.663" offset="11840732">The remaining question then becomes one of a compelling state interest which means what is the danger to the state and certainly it is not in the general enforcement or maintenance of an educational system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.973" offset="11889947">Now, does it deny the child free choice?</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.055" offset="11902276">Does it deny the child as the state says his right to an education?</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.245" offset="11923070">There is national consensus that we have cited in our brief at page 32 to this effect that there is no compelling state interest reflected in state compulsory attendance laws in having children attend school beyond the 15th birthday and this seems to be if this is the case in state after state after state that the state does not feel that a child needs to attend school beyond 15 then it seems to me that these children in question do not present in terms of their own rights to an education any danger to any compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.348" offset="12071445">We have produced an evidence and cited in our brief this study which was by Professor John Hostetler under a Commission from the U.S. Office of Education of achievements of Amish children and standardized testing and it reveals that they perform well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.081" offset="12146365">The state has referred to Prince versus Massachusetts in its argument on behalf of parens patriae but we have been able to show I think quite clearly that there is no such danger to these children as was involved in the Prince case whose facts were that of a child hawking religious magazines at night in streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.975" offset="12245943">Amish life is a gardener of nurture of children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.325" offset="12275409">Certainly, the Attorney General is not telling us that the Child Labor Laws in Wisconsin are not enforced and certainly therefore if there is any need for protection in that direction, the State of Wisconsin is very able to afford that protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.918" offset="12329744">The state has thought loosely about the disease of ignorance and opening the gateways of opportunity to these children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.524" offset="12356180">We introduced positive evidence which shows that Amish education produces good people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.451" offset="12391916">We cited the testimony of Dr. Erickson of the University of Chicago and we specifically asked him questions concerning Amish education which he had very carefully studied and his comment was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.958" offset="12457953">The Amish definitely provide for their children of high school age what could be called an education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.196" offset="12482822">Remember this was uncontroverted by anything the state chose to put in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.375" offset="12499540">I would be inclined to say that they do a better job at this than most of the rest of us do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.028" offset="12518244">The Amish are in a fortunate position respecting schooling which they conduct for children beyond the eighth grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.471" offset="12543948">It is learning by doing, an ideal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.937" offset="12557845">We are learning that current education is detached from the real world and that in the things they talk about, pupils do not become involved or have real responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.657" offset="12604761">The lack in modern education of a clear connection between learning and doing is responsible for much of the student actions that we have today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.303" offset="12643318">We asked what kind of people these are and we put the Sheriff of Green County on the stand, we asked him question after question after question about those crimes of violence which most typical typically committed by young people today; arson, looting, rape, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.218" offset="12718969">The sheriff gave these people a complete bill of health.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.543" offset="12732239">They have never been known for the commission of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.635" offset="12744673">Dr. Littell an authority in the history of the Amish people stated that they have not been known who have committed a felony in 250 years on this soil.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.437" offset="12783857">They are a peaceable people and an asset in our society, not in terms of gross national product or the building of missiles, but certainly in terms –- but certainly in terms of the goodness that they have afford as an example for the rest of our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.332" offset="12875390">We placed the Welfare Director on the stand, the Welfare Director of Green County, and we asked him whether the Amish take care of their old people, their dependent people and the Director of Welfare testified that the Amish completely take care of themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.606" offset="12956474">They do not cast their burden on the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.419" offset="12967759">They do not have people on relief or welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.209" offset="12982910">They do not have their aged and public funds for the aged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.379" offset="13003599">I think that we are talking about here are really great achievers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.814" offset="13021362">They have been in the education business for 300 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.371" offset="13035573">They are the finest natural farmers in the western hemisphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.686" offset="13048843">You go up -- members of the Court you go up to Lancaster County in Pennsylvania and if you were to see these people, see them in actuality, you would find young men who are heads of family and managers of large farms, experts in husbandry, you would find in their women very model women, managers of households, very fine people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.772" offset="13145183">I think that it is quite surprising that these people are singled out as not having an education, denying their people of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.756" offset="13181127">For 300 years, these people have done superbly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.216" offset="13202965">For 300 years these people have performed very well in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.578" offset="13232432">The question before the Court then is whether the state may destroy because that is what it will come to if these children are forced into high school, a peaceable, self sustaining community, 250 years on this soil on the ground, if parents in that community cannot send their children on account of a clear mandate of their religion to one or two years of high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.880" offset="13325636">Mr. Justice Stewart, in Braunfeld said that the orthodox Jews in that case were faced with a cruel choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.637" offset="13352595">A far cruel choice is presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.634" offset="13368582">If the decision of this Court is against the Amish, I fear that many people will feel that this Court has indicted our nation as two (Inaudible) to allow difference, innocent difference to exist and to flourish in its midst.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.565" offset="13444337">The Amish did not come here as fearful supplicants to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.988" offset="13461996">They come here with confidence, believing in this Court as there brothers in justice, in love and goodness, and belief in constitutional liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.426" offset="13503792">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3370.883" offset="13557604">We have absolutely no quarrel to the Amish way of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.822" offset="13577352">In fact in some others, in the remorseless daily crunch of living, the grass on the Amish side of the fence looks green and much greener than ours at times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.628" offset="13636598">But I submit that retreat to a similar era may have had some justification 200 years ago when Russo was exalting the virtues of the Pro-American man, but that too much water has gone through the turbines for that kind of a position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.278" offset="13731161">What is needed is more education to cope with the problems of society, more pride in intellect not less pride.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.292" offset="13771285">This is what we should be developing in our educational programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.496" offset="13812036">The objection that the Amish had is to have additional two years at this point, additional two years of education and the people before the Court here are on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.710" offset="13868879">But if this Court does mature in this decision, it will apply to any number of years of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.985" offset="13905973">There can be no effort or no decision of this Court it seems to me that can say eighth grade is the cutoff point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3478.365" offset="13987579">How can you say that in such sweeping terms when for 200 or 300 years in this country, primary education has been thought to be eight years in elementary, seven or eight years in elementary school?</text>

            <text syncTime="3505.040" offset="14094263">Seventh, eighth and ninth are considered a middle school and then the balance high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.617" offset="14116520">In some areas, there is a junior high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.426" offset="14127805">Now, this is not so important as what is being taught as changing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.464" offset="14151942">The worldly courses of languages and foreign languages and the institution of educational television into the elementary grades, these things are objectionable to see and the dynamic quality of education makes it very difficult to say and to administer a rule which says the eighth grade is the limit beyond which anyone can be compelled to go to school.</text>

            <text syncTime="3572.978" offset="14366041">That education today is undergoing serious study and revision that many experts in the field have written, urging reform and I think that this is necessary.</text>
