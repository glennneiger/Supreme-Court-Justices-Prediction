            <text syncTime="10.264" offset="114680">Well, thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.003" offset="133697">This case which comes on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit raises two important questions of statutory interpretation concerning the scope of the government's liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.708" offset="196496">The issues in this case are closely related to and in our opinion, virtually controlled by the issues decided by this court in the landmark case of Dalehite versus United States decided at 346 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.416" offset="255323">In that case, of course, the government was held not liable under the Tort Claims Act for damage caused in the disastrous explosion of certain chemical fertilizers with it in fact being transported by the government for export abroad which explosion virtually devastated the City of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.772" offset="332750">Fortunately, the factual context to this case is somewhat less ghastly than that which the court confronted in Dalehite.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="86.384" offset="419163">That was basic issue that a private contractor was implementing governmental policies and try to keep (Inaudible) from starving?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Stone</label>
            <text syncTime="96.420" offset="459392">I think, for the most part Mr. Chief Justice, it was assumed in the decision that the government had played a sufficiently close role in entire process including the planning of the export and the transporting and packing of the materials, that, that issue was, at least that level of responsibility was assumed in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.063" offset="537968">Respondents or residents of Nashville, North Carolina which is a rural community of about 1500 inhabitants.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.836" offset="565031">And respondents alleged there on several occasions and especially on November 14, 1968, their house was damaged by so called sonic booms, which put simply noisy vibrations that may occur when aircraft fly overhead, it's speed greater than the speed of sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.483" offset="643607">Respondent sought first to recover from the Air Force under the administrative procedures authorized by the Military Pay Claims Act and the Air Force regulations promulgated thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.326" offset="686971">But the Air Force engineer who investigated their house, concluded in a detailed report which is reproduced at pages 16 and 17 of the record, concluded that the damages to respondent's home had indeed not been caused by sonic booms.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.484" offset="747575">Respondents then sued the government and the District Court under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.554" offset="767846">In answer to their complaint and supporting affidavits, corroborating the event of the sonic boom and the relation of the November 14 sonic boom to certain damages sustained by respondent's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.455" offset="815493">The government filed the motion for summary judgment and supporting affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.226" offset="834615">The government's affidavits acknowledged that indeed the Air Force had conducted a supersonic flight over the Nashville, North Carolina area on the alleged day and that the aircraft and the flight were attached to the Ninth Strategic Reconnaissance Wing of the Strategic Air Command.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.856" offset="901070">That is a branch of the Air Force which is charged with the execution of periodic high level supersonic training flights.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.591" offset="931999">These flights, I understand are used for training pilots for combat missions and are regulated by comprehensive predetermined flight plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.916" offset="965331">The Commander-in-Chief of the Strategic Air Command General Holloway who ranks for purposes of this type of operations directly below the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated in his affidavit that he directed the operational training of Air Cruise by supersonic flights.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.008" offset="1025727">And that the November 14 flight was in his words, “Authorized by and conducted pursuant to my direction”.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.562" offset="1055924">Other affidavits filed by high Air Force personnel also stated that the flight was at all times on course, with respect to location and altitude as prescribed by the mission flight plan directed by the Commander in Chief and this statement is, I gather not controverted in any of the record of this case or in the Court of Appeals opinion, nor it is alleged at all that the flight plan itself was in any manner faulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.659" offset="1168355">The District Court granted the government's motion for summary judgment on the authority of the Dalehite case, on the ground primarily that the planning and execution of the flights in question was a “Discretionary function” for which the government is specifically exempted from liability under section 2688 of the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.411" offset="1247349">And I shall address myself to that discretionary function provision shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.316" offset="1266889">The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's plan of summary judgment and the Court of Appeals held that the discretionary function exemption was inapplicable in this case for reasons which as I say, I shall refer to later.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.568" offset="1319970">On the merits of the case, after getting over the discretionary function exemption, the court held in direct contradiction I believe to this court's holding in Dalehite, that even though no negligence in the planning or operation of the flight had been alleged and no wrongful conduct at all had been alleged, the government could still be liable under the Tort Claims Act under a fury of strict liability for engaging in ultra hazardous activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.618" offset="1424146">The government believes that Court of Appeals erred in both aspects of its holding, both respect to it's refusal to apply the discretionary function exemption and on the merits in it's imposition of the theory of absolute liability for the conduct of ultra hazardous activity under the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.373" offset="1495199">And I shall with the court's permission deal first with the merits of the case, that is, the question whether the Tort Claims Act gives rise to government liability for ultra hazardous activities without finding a fault or negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.860" offset="1561132">As I imagine the members of this court are well aware that Tort Claims Act was enacted by Congress in 1946 and authorized for the first time in this country's history, a very limited and well defined range of Tort actions which could be brought against the Federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.143" offset="1634275">The issue whether the government ought to waive its sovereign immunity from Tort Actions had been vigorously debated in virtually every Congress since 1990 and over 30 bills had been introduced and extensively discussed in both houses of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.660" offset="1700313">We attempt to show throughout our brief in this case, as we did very extensively in our brief in the Dalehite case.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.740" offset="1728629">We have put in our brief here a summary of extremely complex legislative history of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.281" offset="1758827">As this court noted in Dalehite the overwhelming concern of the Congress throughout its discussions about whether to subject the United States to tort liability was the need to provide compensation without resort to the laborious process of private bills for those who had been injured by the ordinary common law tortuous acts of individual government employees and agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.074" offset="1853913">And the chief example of such a tortuous act used literally hundreds of times in the discussions is the negligent operation of a motor vehicle driven by government employee in the scope of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.598" offset="1908038">Indeed the house report in the 79th Congress which ultimately passed the final version of the Tort Claims Act noted the need to ensure that the Act would “Preclude any possibility that the Bill might be construed to authorize suit for damages growing out of an authorized activity where no negligence on the part of any governmental agent is shown and the only ground for suit is the contention that the same conduct by private individual would be tortuous.”</text>

            <text syncTime="488.435" offset="2027366">I thought that the government had a department where the person who suffered damages of this nature can submit a claim and they would be paid administratively.</text>

            <text syncTime="511.954" offset="2121511">It is at West, where I come from, this sonic thing has been a terrible nuisance and it has injured a lot of properties, people have filed their claims and they get paid.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Stone</label>
            <text syncTime="523.676" offset="2168322">Yes, and so in this case, similarly in this case a claim was filed to the Air Force.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.384" offset="2187235">What the Military Pay Claims Act does is authorize the Air Force to establish, and there are other branches of the military through whom damage might occur to civilians to institute procedures under which recovery might be sought regardless of fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.242" offset="2258602">And that administrative procedure was indeed followed in this case by respondents and the Air Force as I stated earlier, the Air Force engineer determined that there was no cause of connection in this case between the sonic boom and the damage inflicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.790" offset="2320878">As a routine matter, the Air Force does pay up to a certain maximum amount specified in the Military Pay Claims Act, damages that occur through sonic booms, but this is --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="570.698" offset="2356509">Mr. Stone, one of the most frequent kinds of damages from the sonic booms is shattered windows. Were there any shattered windows here?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Stone</label>
            <text syncTime="578.721" offset="2388587">According to the investigative report, there were no shattered windows here and I gathered that the primary aspect to damage which respondents have alleged is cracking in the walls.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.005" offset="2437697">And the engineer noted in his report a number of reasons why he thought that it was impossible that the cracking in the walls of this particular house could have been caused by sonic boom and I think the Air Force takes position generally, that cracked glass is the primary danger and that major structural damage has really not been proved yet to be correlated with the sonic booms, but I think, that issue is not present in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="900.018" offset="3673707">Our essential position in this case is, I think it is Hornbook Tort law that strict or absolute liability for the conduct of an ultra hazardous activity is imposed not because a person has engaged in conduct which is in any way negligent or wrongful, but merely because the activity is one which poses a likelihood of damage regardless of a level of care exercised and as the commentators, I think, unanimously agree, it is the unique characteristic of this type of liability that it is imposed not because of a wrongful act but because of a policy judgment that the person who engages in an ultrahazardous activity should bear the risk of harm caused by that activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.715" offset="3832531">And whatever the word wrongful means, in addition to the word negligence, it simply makes no sense to say that an act is wrongful because it gives rise to liability under state law, especially when the underlying assumption of that state law is not that the conduct is wrongful but on the contrary, that it is being to give rise to liability for policy reasons in spite, explicitly in spite of its not being wrongful.</text>

            <text syncTime="1694.683" offset="6852391">Well, we'd be happy to address ourselves to this question in a supplemental -- I see, I have right at the time and I have not yet gotten to the second question which is whether the Tort Claims Act precludes recovery on the basis of the Section 2680a exemption for discretionary functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.063" offset="6945909">I would say in brief that I think that the fact that this activity inherently, the planning operation of this flight was inherently a discretionary function within the meaning of a 2680 exemption, is un-controverted by anyone in this case including respondents and the Court of Appeals that the activity was inherently discretionary, follows very much a fortiori from the Dalehite case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.629" offset="7044234">The ground on which the Court of Appeals refused to apply the discretionary function exemption, was not that the activities were not discretionary but that the discretion was moved by the Air Force regulation 5534 which is reprinted as Appendix C to our petition and that is indeed the regulation promulgated pursuant to the Military Claims Act, which deals with procedures applicable to super sonic flights and recovery for super sonic flights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.278" offset="7166801">And I think it's quite clear that, that regulation has nothing to do with the discretionary nature of the activities involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.549" offset="7199820">The court cited specifically two aspects of regulation 5534.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.400" offset="7219255">It first noted that the regulation instructs the Air Force to assure “maximum protection for civilian communities in carrying out the flights,” and from this the court appears to have a reason that if any damage to a civilian occurs, the conduct of the flight in some way, loses its discretionary nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.340" offset="7295010">The short answer to this contention and I think there are several other answers also is that that the provision for maximum protection of civilians is in its own words made applicable only wherever or whenever feasible and accordingly flights are required to avoid populated areas, “as much as possible”, language which on its face leaves the Air Force with considerable discretion and which is not even alleged to have been abused in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.630" offset="7400231">And in addition of course, I don't think that that regulation could have changed, widened the scope of government liability under the Tort Claims Act anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.259" offset="7438683">The court also refused to apply the discretionary function exemption on the ground that the regulation specifies that “The Air Force must accept the responsibility,” for damage caused by sonic boom and from this, the Court reasoned that there is no discretion to fly supersonic airplane without compensating injured civilians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.153" offset="7526246">I submit to the court that this aspect of the lower court’s holding is really plain on words because whatever discretion the Air Force has to under its own regulations to pay or refuse, to pay damages to injured persons has nothing to do with discretionary function provision of the Tort Claims Act, which relates only to the nature of the activity engaged in and not to the obligation to pay a claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1919.010" offset="7749749">When respondents sought relief from the Act, from the Air Force pursuant to this regulation, as I said earlier that the Air Force engineer who investigated the damaged of premises concluded that the damage was really far smaller in amount than respondents had claimed and then in any event it was not the type of damage that could be caused by sonic boom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.485" offset="7843581">And I think one suspects that the court below was motivated in this case essentially by fueling that the government ought to bear the risk of damage caused by its operation of supersonic flights, and indeed I suppose the theory would extend to the risk of most any government operation in which there was some likelyhood of damaged being imposed or even in which damage was inflicted at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.712" offset="8568531">In other words, the Congress has not taken the risk of Tort Claim suits for improper regulations and it has not taken the risk of Tort Claim suits for conduct that is not wrongful and this Court explicitly says so and after this court read the plain language of the statute to to preclude relief in Dalehite, Congress threw a very extensive private relief bill setup an ad hoc commission which it authorized to compensate the victims of the Texas city explosion and throughout all the debates that proceeded this relief provision, there was no suggestion whatsoever of amending the Tort Claims Act in anyway that would change the holding of Dalehite decision, nor has there been any such discussion since then.</text>

            <text syncTime="3243.817" offset="13048949">A Federal statute authorizes the President of the United States as Command in Chief of the Army and Navy, to make regulations of the Army, Navy, and Air force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.251" offset="13110703">Of course, he doesn't actually make them himself, he delegates that to respective agencies, in this case the Air Force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.255" offset="13146647">But when the Courts hold that they are presumed to have been made by the President and they have the force of law, feeling and I might not have time to complete my brief, I have decided to write a brief on that issue before I received the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.671" offset="13248316">We found 31 cases, three from this High Court, holding that regulations of that type have the force of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.725" offset="13292620">We found one the Ward (ph) case making particularly a scrap of paper out of a regulation, the Ward case was a District Court case in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.864" offset="13341103">So lo and behold, when I got the brief of the government, they cited the Ward case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.989" offset="13373599">We had cited in our brief, because along the cases we found two of those claims were made to us, but we cited all other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.313" offset="13426889">They cited the Ward case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.750" offset="13440682">They decided one above all of these other cases, (Inaudible) that this Court had decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.446" offset="13471402">Perhaps the gentlemen belonging to that school of thought that the last cases have any relevance or importance and they stopped where the last advent cheat of a larger system and looked back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.519" offset="13547784">In the first case they find (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.660" offset="13564293">Now Dean Palm (ph) told us that you might as well read throw your whole law books that's just been in the shelf for 30 years, but you didn't lend it back to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.430" offset="13619359">Now, of course the (Inaudible) case, I understand, it is before the Third Circuit and that the Third Circuit is awaiting the decision of this court in this case before it decides the Ward case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.693" offset="13748404">I want to pay my respects to the famous Dalehite case, of course the lawyers were depleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.532" offset="13811829">I had been the defendant against them in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.397" offset="13835235">500 and some persons were killed and millions of dollars worth of property was destroyed and hundreds of persons injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.624" offset="13880166">Now the amount of the damage ought not to have had anything to do with the decision, but apparently it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.340" offset="13915065">But aside from that in the Dalehite case there was no statute involved as a guide to the court and there was no regulation involved as a guide to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.645" offset="13976296">And according to the court's own reading the ultrahazardous doctrine didn't apply, because the court found that the explosion was a result of an accident, hear what I am saying, absolutely unforeseeable by the exercise of the (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="3525.058" offset="14173887">We know that the Federal government has no powers except those granted in the constitution either expressed it or by necessary implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.728" offset="14232610">Now, we have a Federal statute and a State statute on the same subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.038" offset="14273779">What are we to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.120" offset="14282138">We are required by the law to examine both statutes and if they are not irreconcilably -- if they are not wholly irreconcilable, then we must -– what I am saying, we must construe the two statutes so as to let them both stand if we can, and you have a unique situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.486" offset="14415571">The Federal statute actually creates for word of action under the State law, because it says that the federal government will be liable, if any individual in the state (Inaudible) and it says further that the liability must be according to the state law, then you have the discretion that I am referring to in the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.984" offset="14549632">What are you going to do with that, when you come to construe the statutes?</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.496" offset="14571679">Remember, a lot of times, the limited powers of the Federal government and the unlimited powers of the State government except as they are restricted by Federal constitution and its own constitution and by Federal Statute authorized by the Federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.258" offset="14670736">You will have to construe the discretionary function provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act to the effect that there is no discretion on the power of the Federal government or any agency of the Federal government or any person representing the Federal government, no discretion to violate the positive unambiguous state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.138" offset="14790272">Then both statutes can live together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.800" offset="14804900">Now, that construction in my own judgment would be more in keeping with the intention of the Congress to spread the liability over all of the taxpayers instead of requiring the poor taxpayer who sustained the loss to bear it all.</text>
