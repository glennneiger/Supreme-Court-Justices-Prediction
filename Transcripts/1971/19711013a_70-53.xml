            <label>Mr. Richard B. Stone</label>
            <text syncTime="59.005" offset="309660">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.960" offset="325542">This case which is on direct appeal from the United States District Court from the Southern District of West Virginia is in a somewhat unusual posture and that a Single Judge District Court has declared unconstitutional Section 224, the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.944" offset="389490">In the more normal instance of course, an adjudication that a Federal Statute is unconstitutional, would originate and direct appeal would be taken from a Pre-judge Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.727" offset="432540">This Court has held; however in a closely similar context in Flemming v. Nestor reported at 363 U.S. and in other cases as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.269" offset="470783">That a Pre-judge Court is not mandatory under 28 U.S.C 2282, when an action based on the alleged unconstitutionality of the Federal Statute, does not seek to enjoin the operation of statutory scheme, but merely to acquire the payment of some benefit afforded by that scheme and the Court has invariably retained direct appeals in these circumstances and no question has been raised by other side as to jurisdiction, and I take it that there is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.744" offset="596693">In this case, the provision in question, Section 224 of the Social Security Act, provides that Social Security Disability Benefits, which caused by roughly to lost earnings resulting from the claimant’s disability must be reduced according to a fairly complex formula by virtue of the recipient’s simultaneous receipt of periodic Workman’s Compensation benefits under a state of Federal Workman’s Compensation Plan, in the ordinary case, of course, it is the state plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.606" offset="728142">The offset provision only applies for purposes relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.840" offset="745069">If the total of the claimant’s Social Security Disability Benefits and his Workman’s Compensation Benefits exceed 80% of his average monthly earnings and that is gross earnings without taking into account tax computations acquired to injury.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard B. Stone</label>
            <text syncTime="189.981" offset="833572">Yeah, the average monthly earning is computed on a five year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.671" offset="860321">And, benefits are only reduced in so far as they exceed 80% of those earnings, and of course, the actual effect for anyone whose tax status put him -- causes him pay income tax, in excess of 20% of his gross salary, actually comes out even with the 80%, comes out with more and take home pay that he had acquired through his injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.084" offset="949973">The appellee in this case Mr. Belcher became disabled in 1968 and was awarded at $330 a month in Social Security and Disability Benefits without regard to any Workman’s Compensation, and the Secretary had no notice of his receipt of Workman’s Compensation at that time and that award was made in October of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.970" offset="1033565">Three months later, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, notified Mr. Belcher that his Federal benefits would be reduced by a $104 a month because of his simultaneous receipt of $203 per month in State Workman’s Compensation Benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.123" offset="1102111">The scheme is quite simple, without the offset, Mr. Belcher would have received a total of $534 in Social Security and Workman’s Compensation Benefits which would have been a 100% of his prior gross earnings, and as a result of the offset, his benefits total to $430 or exactly 80% of his average prior earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.761" offset="1188733">Mr. Belcher requested a hearing to challenge the reduction of his Federal benefits and the hearing was held before a Hearing Examiner at which appellee was represented by an Attorney, who I believe represents him here in this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.391" offset="1239201">The Hearing Examiner upheld the reduction and this ruling became in the normal course of HEW Administrator rulings, the final decision of the secretary of HEW.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.537" offset="1283818">I believe he then brought suit in the United States District Court under Section 405 or 42 U.S.C. 405G to reveal (somebody coughed) the Secretary’s administrative decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.287" offset="1326868">And I take it that at no point in the court below or in the administrative process has appellee denied in any aspect of the factual or legal basis which underlay the Secretary’s determination that Section 224 applied to him and precisely the manner in which HEW applied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.481" offset="1403564">Nor has appellee raised any question whatsoever as to the procedural rights, such as an evidentiary hearing which has been fully afforded to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.816" offset="1444942">His sole contention and the sole ground of decision in the District Court below was that it is unconstitutional, as a substantive matter for Congress to reduce Social Security Disability Benefits by virtue of Workman’s Compensation Benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.704" offset="1508471">In upholding appellee’s claim, the Court below stands alone and it odds with eight other District Courts, at least eight other District Courts that have routinely ruled on this question and with their recent decision of the 6th circuit Court of Appeals, which has upheld the constitutionality of Section 224.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.496" offset="1591645">Now, the Court arrived at its decision that Section 224 is unconstitutional on essentially two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.055" offset="1621843">The first of these grounds, I believe, can be dealt with rather briefly and I think it reflects a misconception of certain decisions of this court which are to be pretty readily apparent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.909" offset="1673356">In Goldberg Versus Kelly, at 397 U.S., this Court held it when the Administrators of a State Welfare Program, in that case it was the Aid to Dependent Children program, determined that a particular recipient no longer qualifies for benefits under the statutory standards governing that program, those benefits that cannot be cut off until the recipient has been given some sort of an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.001" offset="1781712">This Court reasoned in Goldberg that a welfare recipient in the ADC Program has at least, a sufficient right whether you call it a property right or whatever you call it, in those benefits, so that it violates standard notions or procedural due process to cut off those benefits summarily without any kind of a proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="452.700" offset="1884426">No, no claim whatsoever, Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.882" offset="1897173">It maybe said, I suppose that Goldberg, what Goldberg did was put to a final rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.113" offset="1922146">A theory that really the Government had not attempted to make in a welfare context for sometime, that those benefits are really a privilege rather that a right and if that automatically cuts off any procedural difficulty in simply taking them away.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.032" offset="1989751">And I think, that that document has been laid to rest and those extractions happily are not issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.367" offset="2019113">However, this District Court through a process that is not entirely elaborated and which is somewhat mystical to me, reasons on the basis of Goldberg and Kelly that Congress cannot build into the statutory formula for computing Social Security Disability Benefits, which it analogizes to welfare benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.560" offset="2099884">Any circumstances which would reduce the maximum allowable benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.723" offset="2120573">Now, without going into the applicability of Goldberg and Kelly to Social Security Programs, a question which we assume be before this Court in which Certiorari was granted yesterday, I gather.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.009" offset="2169683">I think, it is safe to say that Goldberg and Kelly which dealt entirely with procedural rights are not in question here, but in no way implies a limitation on the legislative authority to device a reasonable substantive formula for determining the proper amount of Social Security Benefits owed to any claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.519" offset="2251707">In other words, from Goldberg and Kelly which is applied to this case, I suppose, might preclude HEW from cutting off the claimant’s benefits without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.587" offset="2288070">It is very, very long steps to the notion that that claimant has a vested interest in the maximum amount of benefit which statute ever even potentially afforded to him or the notion that Congress can attach no other qualifications to the statutory standard which governs the amount of benefits owing to the claimant.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.377" offset="2363198">(Inaudible) HEW could not do anything to that?</text>
            <text syncTime="576.259" offset="2378662">Assuming they had a hearing, they had lawyers and they had everything else they could not do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.615" offset="2396112">But just what they did, is they did it.</text>

            <text syncTime="582.772" offset="2404785">That is right Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.902" offset="2409278">This is the statutory standard and it is the statutory standard which Mr. Belcher brings to question here and I wish the District Judge ruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.176" offset="2450342">As a matter of fact here it shows in the record that this hearing process was, I suppose, essentially a little useless since the ground that was being claimed was the unconstitutionally of the statute and the Hearing Examiner noted several times that you do not seem to bring in the question anything about your applicability to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.207" offset="2526515">Now, it is interesting to know, just put this in perspective, that when disability benefits were first introduced into the Social Security Program in 1956, recipients were required to offset the full amount of Workman’s Compensation Benefits regardless of whether the total of Disability and Workman’s Compensation exceeded any specified limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.856" offset="2605092">That provision was temporarily repealed in 1958 and then reenacted in 1965 with the current proviso that the benefits will not be reduced unless the total of the two types of programs equals 80% of prior earnings, and I --</text>

            <text syncTime="660.568" offset="2715955">It was repealed in 1958, essentially because there was a testimony in legislative hearings to the effect that there really were not that many instances of duplication.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.872" offset="2769141">I have pointed out that the Workman’s Compensation program is very much expanded since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.280" offset="2790770">It was thought that the offset was somewhat experimental when it was passed in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.333" offset="2806966">In 1958, Congress was persuaded in some way that there simply were not enough instances of duplication to (Inaudible) to go through the administrative difficulty of enforcing these offset provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.044" offset="2865898">Now, between 1958 and 1965, there were volumes, and volumes of testimony to which we refer in our brief to the effect that in fact there was a serious amount of duplication that state Workman’s Compensation Coverage had grown by leaps and bounce, and that this duplication was posing a serious problem both from the point of view of purposes of the Social Security Act which I shall discuss shortly and from --</text>

            <text syncTime="733.602" offset="3008109">Now, I think, it is also worth noting that, though I think it is quite clear that Congress did not have to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.821" offset="3032978">It did, in fact, restrict the offset provision contained in Section 224, the persons whose injuries occurred after the date of statute and thus who had not come to rely upon a receipt of a certain amount of income which will then be later on lowered.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.331" offset="3095044">Appellee's injury occurred in 1968 and so that in order to attack the application of Section 224 to this case, he must argue as I suppose he does, and either that the original Section 224 was unconstitutional and its inclusion of an offset provision or that the temporary repeal of that provision in some way forever precluded Congress from restoring an offset or from reducing the maximum allowable benefit with respect to an individual claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.233" offset="3206640">I think, that it is not an exaggeration and it does not need much elaboration to say that the holding of the Court below on this point, that Congress cannot in effect include an offset provision in this kind of statute or reduce benefits which are theoretically and potentially in the statute, would throw into chaos, a great number of the Social Security and Welfare Programs enforced today virtually, all of which by necessity compute their benefits in terms of offsets and reductions which are geared to the legislative view of need and which are designed to provide the most effective distribution of limited funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="830.780" offset="3396811">The second ground which the District Court relied upon in which the appellant's raise to invalidate Section 224 is based upon the claim, that Section 224 discriminates invidiously between the Workman’s Compensation, recipients of Workman’s Compensation Benefits whose Social Security Disability Benefits maybe reduced in certain circumstances and recipients of any other type of relief such as Tort recovery and private insurance policy whose Social Security Disability Benefits are not thereby reduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.011" offset="3529722">Now, with respect to this argument, which I suppose is really the key argument in the case, I would like the outset to reiterate to very well known and related equal protection concepts which have been repeatedly affirmed by this Court and which are quite clearly at -- I would even say, perhaps are classically applicable to the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.840" offset="3628987">One of these is the concept that legislative reform such as Congress had in mind in the offset provision Section 224, is not invidiously discriminatory merely because it is not going far enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.574" offset="3679978">In other words, even if the reasons which Congress had in mind when it formulated the offset provision such as to avoid excessive benefits and encourage the rehabilitation of workers, even if those reasons are equally applicable to recipients of other kinds of other kinds of disability recovery and I will show shortly that Congress did not believe that they were equally applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.997" offset="3757614">Congress is failure to acquire the offset of these other benefits, it is not by itself wherein the Section 224 unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.771" offset="3792723">This Court, I suppose, the classic statement of that was Williams v. The Optical Company in which a 348 U.S. in which the Court said that the reform may take one step at a time addressing itself based the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.280" offset="3850819">And in this case, the legislative history which we had referred to a link in our brief shows, I think, clearly that the problem which was most acute in Congress’s mind was, in fact, the high percentage of disability recipients whose simultaneous Workman’s Compensation Benefits brought their combined receipts from those two sources, well above, their pre-injury salaries and incomes.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.527" offset="3939740">And I suggest it is natural enough that Congress would have focused primarily on Workman’s Compensation, since these programs have really become very, very wide spread are now in operation in all states and jurisdiction for the United States and in many States are in fact compulsory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1005.518" offset="4095743">Just to bear remind the second, and this is perhaps the most important concept applicable in this area, all together, it is that, in a context which does not involved what this Court has called Fundamental Constitutional Rights and a context in which the classification is not a suspect in any grounds, for example, of race or religion which I clearly take it -- no one claims what this classification is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.026" offset="4201800">In that context, a statutory classification is not invalid merely because it is rough or imperfect in some respect, but only if that classification cannot be rationally justified on any ground, whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.535" offset="4255822">This Court has quite reasonably applied that in notion to the area of social welfare in Dandridge v. Williams decided at 397 U.S. and of course in Flemming v. Nestor at 363 U.S., in Dandridge, the Court held valid under the equal protection clause a statutory scheme which promised eligibility for assistance under the Aid to Dependent Children program on the basis of the number of dependent children but then set a maximum amount of benefit that could be recovered regardless of the number of children, and I submit that this place in which the provision, the offset provision, in question is not even applicable unless the very standard of need which Congress has defined which is 80% of prior earnings has been met, is considerably easier to decide really on both of the grounds raised by the appellees in the Court below than is Dandridge and Williams and it is far easy to decide than that in Flemming and Nestor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.991" offset="4505657">I think that appellees in the court below raised a number of interesting questions with respect to what Mr. Justice Marshall has just asked, a number of interesting questions with respect to the wisdom of Congress's decision to apply Section 224 to recipients of Workman’s Compensation only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.446" offset="4571485">But I think that their arguments have in no way casted out upon the constitutionality of Section 224 because the offended funded legislative history in this area shows that Congress indeed had a perfectly plausible, even if debatable rationale for singling out duplicating benefits arising from Workman’s Compensation Programs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1159.009" offset="4709725">Its primary focus was on the Workman’s Compensation problem and -- but I think it is important to note that the reasons why it especially wanted to avoid duplication in the Workman’s Compensation area are not applicable to these other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.392" offset="4771270">So, that Congress did focus on certain specific reasons which would not have been applicable to other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.202" offset="4794466">At every stage of the history of this provision, Congress considered volumes of testimony to the effect that if excessive duplication of benefits were allowed, many States would eliminate or seriously curtail the coverage of their Workman’s Compensation Programs, and the reason for this is that the states will inevitably want to avoid excessive duplication, and to encourage rehabilitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.186" offset="4894463">And that theory would not be true with the disable workers themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.728" offset="4908569">It is perfectly natural that the disabled workers themselves are perfectly happy to get better benefits after their injury than before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.149" offset="4934274">They are not going to have any particular interest in rehabilitation, really, only the state administering a state run program is going to be watching after that interest, so that alternative roots to Federal coverage will really only be cut off in areas which are governed by the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="1312.745" offset="5324648">I would add another rationale which we illustrated in our brief is that the Congress has really from the inception of the Social Security Program attempted not to discourage potential claimants from procuring the protection through private means such as insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.747" offset="5384625">It appears that this consideration, the interest in maintaining other alternative methods to Federal protection has really outweighed Congress's interest with respect to private insurance Tort recovery and so on has outweighed Congress’s interest in awarding duplicating benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.083" offset="5457977">Indeed, if you take as the overall rationale which I think comes quite naturally out of the legislative history, that everything Congress has done in this area has reflected an interest in encouraging the maintenance of non-Federal sources of this recovery with this interest in mind the decision to acquire offset in the case of Workman’s Compensation recoveries but not in other cases, it seems sensible enough even if its conclusions are arguable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2815.264" offset="11334692">If Congress had a specific purpose that was impartially applied to all people who would be disabled, then it would be perfectly -- I would be perfectly agreeable that this is a good law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2848.421" offset="11467394">And I think probably in 1956, that someone was delegated with the job of coming up with an Accident or Disability Provision for the compensation for the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.769" offset="11516713">And looking to see where they would find what would be the proper terms to put in there, they picked up Accident and Health Insurance.</text>
