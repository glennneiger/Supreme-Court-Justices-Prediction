            <label>Mr. Matthew J. Zinn</label>
            <text syncTime="18.532" offset="147808">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.888" offset="161183">This Federal Income Tax case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.622" offset="188141">It raises a question with which this court is familiar -- whether a shareholder in a closely held corporation is entitled to business or nonbusiness bad debt deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.966" offset="237565">If he is unable to collect a debt owed to him by his corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.140" offset="258254">The difference between a business and nonbusiness bad debt deduction is critical since the former is deductible against the ordinary income and maybe carried back as part of a net operating loss, whereas the latter is deductible only as a short term capital loss and may not be carried back to offset the ordinary income prior years.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.401" offset="359296">This court’s decision in Whipple against the Commissioner in 1963, settled the question whether merely investing in a corporation is a trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.512" offset="411749">The court held that it is not and consequently a mere investor in a corporation who is unable to recover his advances to the corporation, is entitled only to nonbusiness bad debt treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.141" offset="466189">On the other hand, since the rendering of services to a corporation for remuneration constitutes a trade or business, an employee who advances funds to his corporation in order to protect his job and salary and who is unable to collect the debt owed to him by his corporation, is entitled to a business bad debt deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.609" offset="564096">The problem in this case arises where a taxpayer bears the dual relationship of shareholder and employee to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.373" offset="603175">If he were merely a shareholder, then as I have said, he would be entitled only to nonbusiness bad debt treatment but if he were only an employee who advanced funds to protect his job and salary, he would be entitled to business bad debt treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.800" offset="668899">In the dual status situation which arises here however whether taxpayer is motivated both by desire to protect his job and salary and by desire to protect his investment, the Internal Revenue Code makes no provision for allocating the loss in part to business and in part to nonbusiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.662" offset="752282">The loss must be characterized in its entirety as business or nonbusiness in nature even though the shareholder employee was motivated by both business and nonbusiness considerations to make a loan or guaranteed his corporation’s debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.723" offset="824589">Section 166 (d) of the code is the relevant statute and it is set out on page 36 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.616" offset="868161">It provides that the term nonbusiness debt means the debt other than a debt created or acquired in connection with the trade or business of the taxpayer or a debt or loss from the worthlessness of which is incurred in the taxpayer’s trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.700" offset="944438">The pertinent regulations are set out on pages 36 and 37 of our brief and insofar as they are relevant here, they provide as explicated in Whipple, that a debt will be considered a business bad debt, if the loss resulting from the debts becoming worthless is proximately related to maintaining the taxpayer’s trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.709" offset="1048510">The position of the United States in this case is that in a dual status situation the test to satisfy only if the dominant motivation for the taxpayer’s undertaking was to protect his business interest as an employee rather than his nonbusiness interest as a stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.120" offset="1130117">The position of the respondent is that a taxpayer is entitled to business bad debt treatment even if his dominant motivation was to protect his investment so long as he was significantly motivated by his business interest as an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.290" offset="1202842">With this background, let me turn to the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.306" offset="1218933">Mr. Generes, the respondent and his son-in-law William Kelly, each owned 44% of the stock of the Kelly-Generes Construction Company, a corporation engaged in heavy construction work, principally for governmental authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.208" offset="1286538">The remainder of the stock was owned by a son and another son-in-law of Mr. Generes.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.523" offset="1311720">The corporation had been formed in 1954 as successor to a partnership in which Mr. Generes and Mr. Kelly had been equal partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.418" offset="1351322">Mr. Kelly was the Vice-President of the corporation, was in charge of its day to day operations and received a salary of $15,000 a year for the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.482" offset="1395625">Mr. Generes was President, was principally responsible for obtaining bank financing and securing performance and bid bonds on construction jobs undertaken by the corporation and was paid a salary of $12,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.147" offset="1458215">Mr. Generes’ principal employment was as President of a Savings and Loan Association for which he worked full-time and received an annual salary of $19,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.612" offset="1508161">At a pretrial deposition, Mr. Generes testified that he devoted about one hour a week to the affairs of the Kelly-Generes Construction Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.624" offset="1548181">At trial, he testified that he spent 6-8 hours a week on the corporation’s affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.092" offset="1578065">Mr. Generes’ original investment in the corporation was $38,900.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.840" offset="1605023">In addition, he advanced funds to the corporation from time to time when it was short of working capital and also guaranteed the corporation’s bank loans to enable the corporation to purchase machinery and equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.379" offset="1663224">In 1962, when the corporation was in serious financial difficulty, he advanced it $158,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.730" offset="1704602">The corporation was required to the furnish performance and payment bonds in connection with its construction business, which was largely performed for governmental authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.488" offset="1751622">Most of these bonds were written by the Maryland Casualty Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.491" offset="1771684">From 1954 to 1958, casualty as a matter of course, required Mr. Generes to indemnify it with respect to each bond issued to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.930" offset="1825392">Bonds were issued on an individual job basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.744" offset="1840647">Late in 1958 to obviate the need for individual bonds on each construction job, Mr. Generes and Mr. Kelly acting for themselves individually and also for the corporation, signed a blanket indemnity agreement with Maryland Casualty.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.246" offset="1918701">Under this agreement, casualty agreed to add as surety for the corporation for up to a million-and-a-half dollars on anyone job and two million dollars overall.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.215" offset="1962483">Mr. Generes and Mr. Kelly in turn agreed to indemnify Casualty for any loss it might suffer as surety.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.283" offset="1998845">In 1962, the corporation defaulted on two contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.408" offset="2019325">Maryland Casualty made good on the defaults and Mr. Mr. Generes was called upon to respond under his indemnity agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.093" offset="2054016">He indemnified Casualty for a $162,000 which he was unable to recover from the corporation because of its bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.274" offset="2094767">He was also unable to collect the $158,000 that he had advanced to the corporation in 1962 in direct loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.206" offset="2138548">In his income tax return for 1962, Mr. Generes treated the loss on the direct loans as a nonbusiness bad debt and the commissioner allowed that loss and it is not here in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.427" offset="2191420">However, he treated his indemnification loss of $162,000 as a business bad debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.772" offset="2220781">The proper treatment of that $162,000 as business or nonbusiness is the sole issue before this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.720" offset="2256517">The case was tried before a jury in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.958" offset="2269474">The trial lasted one day.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.122" offset="2282117">Mr. Generes testified and I refer now to page 67 of the record that the only reason he signed the indemnity agreement with Maryland Casualty was to protect his part-time job with the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.958" offset="2345542">In response to the question whether he had given any thought at all to his investment in the corporation in guaranteeing, and his investment on my point out it consisted both of his stock interest and his direct loans to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.260" offset="2406669">He testified and I quote, “No, I never once gave it a thought.”</text>
            <text syncTime="589.332" offset="2431015">And I quote again from page 69 of the record, “To tell you the truth about it, I never gave that a thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.148" offset="2462257">I never gave my investment a thought.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1085.660" offset="4416321">Well, $200,000 investment and also he had other motivations we think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.516" offset="4439727">After all, it was his son-in-law who was running this business and I think another son-in-law was working in the business, the stock was owned by him individually by two of his sons-in-law and a son and so we think he had significant personal motivations here as well as nonbusiness motivations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.981" offset="4529588">Our position that business bad debt treatment should be allowed in a dual status situation only where the dominant motivation for the undertaking is protection of employment rests on four considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.682" offset="4588416">The first of these arises simply from the fact that we are faced with a situation here where we must characterize a bad debt in its entirety as business or nonbusiness in nature, even though, the taxpayer was motivated by two considerations to guarantee his corporation’s debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.753" offset="4660723">Now, the Internal Revenue code might have provided him such circumstances that half of the debt should be treated as business bad debt and half should be treated as a nonbusiness bad debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.911" offset="4697294">But that is not what it does provide, the choice has to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.336" offset="4710982">Either it is all business or it is all nonbusiness and we submit that purely from the standpoint of logic and in the absence of any overriding policy consideration, it is far more logical to have the character of the debt determined by reference to the weightier consideration rather than by the reference to a lesser consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.123" offset="4798127">Secondly, we have referred in our brief to several analogous situations in which the tax consequences are determined by reference to the weightier consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.043" offset="4837833">In situations were an all or nothing choice must be made just as here and the first involves the business bad debt provision itself prior to 1942, as Mr. Justice White pointed out in his opinion in Whipple, there was no such thing as business and nonbusiness bad debts, they were simply bad debts and whether they were business and nonbusiness or otherwise, that they went unrepaid, they were deductible against the ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.630" offset="4952145">The substantial loophole developed in the Internal Revenue Code where loans would be made to family members and go unrepaid and taxpayers would claim an ordinary deduction against for these loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.060" offset="5021944">So one of the primary purposes of Congress's enactment of the business nonbusiness dichotomy in 1942 was to close up this loophole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.766" offset="5060709">Now you could have a situation where instead of -- as we have here for the most part, we are talking about a nonbusiness investment consideration against a business consideration, where you have primarily a nonbusiness personal consideration against a business consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.443" offset="5127478">Now under the test that respondent proposes the significant test, a business bad debt would be allowed even if the weightier consideration was its personal consideration and we submit this would be squarely contrary to the congressional intent in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.846" offset="5201039">Similarly, as Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out in the Hartman case, one of the purposes of the 1942 legislation was to put nonbusiness investments in the form of loans on a footing with nonbusiness investments in the form of stock and the courts have held that where corporate stock is purchased both for business reasons and investments reasons, that dominant motivation is controlling and characterizing with that loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.337" offset="5311067">Again, to put the two on an equal footing, only the dominant standard can be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.129" offset="5334159">Finally, we refer to the fact that in the legislative history of section 166, there are references to applying the same test as is applied under section 165, in determining whether an expense is incurred or a loss is incurred in a trade or business or in a transaction entered into for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.677" offset="5416393">And under the Section 165 it is clear that the dominant standards controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.958" offset="5441470">And thirdly, a point that I referred to in answering Mr. Justice Stewart, we think the dominant standards is far easier to apply by a jury than the significant standard and we think it is necessary only to the point to what happened in this particular case and the difficulty that the jury encountered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.625" offset="5516181">And lastly, we rely on the opinion in the Whipple case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.931" offset="5533421">The gist of the opinion, it seems to us is that a presumption exist against the allowance of business bad debt treatment to stockholders whose interest on not subordinate to the interest of other stockholders and this is just as it should be, because it is a rare case in which an employee with no other interest in the corporation would undertake to advance substantial funds to a guaranteed debts of his corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.281" offset="5630806">Application of these significant standard we believe would go a long way toward overcoming the presumption in the Whipple case as it can be seen from this case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.411" offset="5675318">A taxpayer maybe able to overcome it simply by testifying that he did not give his investment a thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.127" offset="5702172">I should like to retain my remaining time for rebuttal, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1619.390" offset="6551256">We never had any question about that, as a practical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.295" offset="6566825">What you really get down to here is that over a number of years, this company was in the contracting business and you are talking about a very unique kind of business, you are talking about a business that was engaged in municipal public works contract for which they had to have payment and performance bonds and I have in testimony introduced of the Vice-President of Maryland Casualty Company, by a local insurance agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.098" offset="6654074">All of them testified, we will not grant payment in performance bonds to small corporations without the personal endorsement of the principal officers of those corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.100" offset="6694094">As a result of this, Allen Generes and his son-in-law William F. Kelly agreed to indemnify the bonding company for writing bonds for the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.552" offset="6731919">It was the only way the corporation could have gotten bonds and the only way the corporation could have stayed in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.941" offset="6753444">And consequently over a number of years this was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.941" offset="6765461">Finally in 1958, a blanket indemnity agreement was executed and this is why you talk about two million dollar exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.930" offset="6793359">The government is strongest scarecrow, I mention here, when I say, “Look he is endorsing -- why would he expose himself to two million dollars worth of liability for a simple $12,000 a year?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.577" offset="6835991">The fact of the matter is, you are not really exposing yourself to anything like two million dollars worth of liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.732" offset="6860651">This meant merely that Maryland would bond contracts which aggregated a contract price of two million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.932" offset="6893356">That meant the corporation had contracts to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.013" offset="6905686">It meant there would be money paid on those contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.329" offset="6914985">There would be retainage, there will be stage payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.109" offset="6926061">Mr. Generes would only be liable to Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.027" offset="6937764">If the corporation did not perform the contracts and if the amount of retainage that was left in the contract was insufficient to pay Maryland off and then you had all the assets of the corporations to go against before Mr. Generes would become liable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1868.601" offset="7548089">That is the language of the statute, the 1939 code said the debt must be incurred in the trade or business.</text>

            <text syncTime="2073.460" offset="8367498">That is correct but I would submit that there is a significant relationship in the business relationship area that gives rise to a business bad debt and if Congress did not intend that result, all Congress had to do was say primarily in connection with and that would have ended the matter and they have done that in other section of the code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.701" offset="8432491">This court has interpreted other of the section to the code as for example with the capital assets, we talked about primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business and the court is interpreted the word primarily and that would have put it in to the matter here but when they say in connection with, this Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued its own regulations and used the word proximate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.941" offset="8517441">I said that is what is meant here, a proximate relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.287" offset="8530816">And then of course they get annoyed when the courts look at the word proximate and as the Second Circuit did and as the Fifth Circuit did, they see that there is an analogy in the tort law, they have not drawn on the tort law but we know that you may have more than one proximate clause and all that we are talking about there is certain nearness, a certain importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.945" offset="8621408">The point here is that this will not give rise to baseless deductions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2217.849" offset="8945118">Your honor that would be somewhat misleading because what happened was that in 1962 of the end of the game really -- this corporation which had been having millions of dollars of business every year, in 1962, they seriously under bid two major contracts and the corporation became default -- they defaulted on those contracts and Maryland stepped-in in order to try to bail out the corporation and to salvage the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.246" offset="9050652">Then in 1962 Mr. Generes made loans to the corporation of a very substantial amount, you are right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.838" offset="9076984">He tried to salvage the corporation at a time when it was going under and I submit that is a big difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.727" offset="9100598">There you are talking about loans to the corporation and Mr. Generes deducted those as nonbusiness bad debts because he loaned them to them and the last year at a time when the corporation was going under.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.114" offset="9150127">What we are talking about in this case is not a loan to the corporation, it never was and it is misleading if we try to think of it as a loan of a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.205" offset="9186489">This was an agreement to a bonding company to personally indemnify that bonding company, if the bonding company would write bonds for the corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2291.534" offset="9239779">In order to stay in business and in order to have a going business you needed bonds as a fact of life in the construction business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.541" offset="9271857">Kelly-Generes Construction Company could not get jobs, if it could not get payment in performance bonds and it could not get payment and performance bonds without the personal endorsements of Allen H. Generes and William F. Kelly and as a result, Generes and Kelly both agreed to Maryland we will personally indemnify, that is not a loan to the corporation and the issue in the case was in executing the agreement to indemnify the bonding company, what was Generes’s motivation?</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.687" offset="9380422">Now, the trail judge charged this jury that there are number of factors that they should consider and only one was the motivation but the test has now boiled down and got into this court is when he executed that indemnity agreement agreeing to indemnify Maryland so that the corporation could get bonds and go as a growing concern, he was probably was significantly motivated by the desire to protect his trade or business as a salaried option.</text>

            <text syncTime="3135.963" offset="12617516">I think and if the business relationship between the Taxpayer’s Act, the debt and the loss, if there is a significant relationship between that debt and the trade or business of the taxpayer then I submit that under 166 as written, the taxpayer is entitled to a business bad debt deduction and if the Commissioner of Internal Revenue disapproves of that, he wants them to have the predominant test or the dominant motivation then they should go to Congress and get Congress to amend Section 166 and say a debt created or acquired as the case maybe primarily in connection with the trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.358" offset="12755129">That would have resolved the point and I would not have the nerve to argue a significant motivation test to the court if Congress had put in the word 'primarily' as they have in many other sections of the code.</text>

            <text syncTime="3197.877" offset="12865157">I should like to respond first to the principal argument which respondent makes here, it was the principal argument in his brief which focuses on subsection capital A of Section 166(d) 2, the 'in connection with' language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.547" offset="12939867">As I understand the argument of respondent, he conceives that subsection B would not be sufficiently broad to allow a significant motivation standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.040" offset="12993784">Now first of all, let me point out to the court that the term proximate as it appears in the regulations under that we have quoted on page 37 applies only to subsection B, that regulation was there long before the code was amended in 1954 to add subsection A.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.864" offset="13077167">And we have pointed out on page 15 of our brief in footnote seven, what Congress's purpose was in enacting subsection A and it is really quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.750" offset="13124709">Under the law as it existed before 1954, a taxpayer who acquired a debt when he was in a trade or business and then went out of the trade or business before a final determination was made as to the worthlessness of the debt was entitled only to a nonbusiness bad debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.478" offset="13203599">The sole purpose of subsection A, as we have stated in footnote seven was to make it clear that if the taxpayer went out of business after having acquired a debt in a course of a trade of a trade or business and then the debt became worthless, he would get a business bad debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.519" offset="13275697">But this court to read in to that edition of subsection A, all that respondent urges, it seems to us would be making an awful lot out of a little.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.986" offset="13317598">And I urge the court to read legislative history of subsection A, it is very short and that is the sole purpose of the addition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.258" offset="13354692">As far as the absence of the word primarily, I would make two points, first it seems to us that just as we are trying to read the word 'primarily' into the statute, the respondent is trying to read the word 'significantly' into the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.095" offset="13414042">We think there is a gap there that this court has to fill and it is not a one sided gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.493" offset="13431596">It has to be filled one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.539" offset="13439851">Congress simply did not contemplate this dual status case when it enacted the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3406.552" offset="13699926">It was found that the primary purpose was personal and that was the end of the case and the word 'primarily' does not appear in section 165(c) 2 as well as in section 166(d) As far as the word proximate, we would only note again that so far as the tort law is concerned, the considerations are entirely different.</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.478" offset="13807550">Here, we have to go back to the fact, what choice has to be made?</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.861" offset="13821134">That simply is not the case in the tort law, you can hold two or three or a greater number tort fees as libel for single tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.965" offset="13861572">And I guess, I even pointed out except in passing that the considerations that have expanded notions of proximate cause are wholly different from those that this court has to take into account in deciding this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.003" offset="13913712">One final point Mr. Nathan would have this court draw a severe distinction between loans and guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.558" offset="13943909">But we do not think that is permissible under the decision of this court in the Putnam case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.665" offset="13964285">Mr. Justice Brennan, their writing for the court held loans and guarantees ought to be considered the same for purposes of interpretation of the bad debt provision of the code.</text>
