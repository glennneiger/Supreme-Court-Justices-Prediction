            <label>Mr. Donald A. Schabel</label>
            <text syncTime="36.962" offset="221469">May I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.737" offset="232649">These cases are here on direct appeal from an interlocutory injunction granted by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, sitting as three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.291" offset="278833">That Court by a 2:1 decision held Article 27 of the Indiana Election Code, insofar as it establishes a procedure for a recount of the votes cast for the Office of United States Senator to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.861" offset="337139">Further consideration, the question of this Court's jurisdiction has been postponed to the hearing of the cases on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.276" offset="366814">The issues presented by the two appeals are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.997" offset="381651">In addition to the jurisdictional issue, the questions presented are as follows: without regard to the applicability of the Anti-Injunction Statute or to the alleged unconstitutionality of the election code, first substantive question presented is whether the interlocutory injunction was proper under established principles of equity jurisprudence?</text>
            <text syncTime="102.396" offset="483216">The second question is whether the interlocutory injunction appealed from is prohibited by the language of the Anti-Injunction Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.814" offset="520936">The third question presented is whether Article 27 of the Indiana Election Code insofar as it establishes a procedure for a recount of the votes cast for the Office of United States Senator conflicts with Article 1, Section 5 of the Constitution of the United States, which makes a Senate the Judge of the elections returns in qualifications of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.238" offset="610589">Now, I am dividing the time of the Appellants with Mr. Richard Johnson, so I shall discuss the jurisdictional issue in the first of the questions I have stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.811" offset="648936">Mr. Johnson will discuss the second and third questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.715" offset="668580">Before addressing myself to the question of jurisdiction, I shall first state the relevant facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.777" offset="696793">Appellant Roudebush and Appellee Hartke were candidates for the Office of the United States Senator at the January Election held in the State of Indiana on November 3, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.732" offset="744544">The canvass of the return show that Hartke had the greater number of votes by a margin of 4,383 votes out of a 1,737,797 votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.022" offset="813717">The Indiana Election Code provides that any candidate for any office voted upon in any election held in the State of Indiana including specifically the Office of the United States Senator has a right to petition for a recount of the votes cast in any voting precinct, any or all voting precincts of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.267" offset="894696">Provided he petitions in the appropriate Courts within 15 days after the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.479" offset="919565">Pursuant to this, Appellant Roudebush filed Petitions for Recount on November 17, 1970 in certain selected precincts in 11 Indiana Counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.713" offset="972541">Two days later, Appellee Hartke appeared in all 11 proceedings and moved to dismiss on the grounds at the proceeding interfered with the prerogatives of the United States Senate under Article 1 Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.815" offset="1028966">On December 1, 1970, the Superior Court of Marion County Room 3 in which one of the proceedings was pending overruled Hartke’s motion to dismiss and appointed the Appellee’s Samuel Walker, John Hammond, and Dugg Butler as a Recount Commission, the directed that they convene on December 8, 1970 and commence a recount of the votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.802" offset="1124887">On December 3, 1970, the Lake Circuit Court also overruled Hartke’s motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.978" offset="1153622">Instead of seeking relief from the Supreme Court of Indiana and if necessary from this Court, Appellee Hartke instead filed a compliant for Injunctive Relief in the Court below on December 3, 1970, and this complaint he resided the proceedings had in the Marion County Election and alleged that the recount statute conflicted with Article 1 Section 5 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.968" offset="1249544">Jurisdiction was predicated under 28 United States Code Section 1343 subparagraph 3 which confers jurisdiction on the District Courts in Civil Right Actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.438" offset="1295415">Generally, the complaint alleged that the Defendants acting color of law would deprive Appellee Hartke of the rights, privileges and immunities, secured to him by Article 1, Section 5 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.255" offset="1350690">This complaint contained no explanation by relief was not sought on the Supreme Court of Indiana that contains no showing of irreparable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.301" offset="1390918">The prayer was that a three-judge court be convened to declare Article 27 of the Election Code unconstitutional and to restrain the Defendant’s from proceeding with the recount.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.114" offset="1438148">Along with the complaint, Hartke filed a verified application for a Temporary Restraining Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.451" offset="1463434">In this application, he specifically alleged that he appeared in all 11 recount proceedings and raised the constitutional question and he also resided that the ruling of the Marion County Court against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.313" offset="1510873">Not withstanding this, the District Judge to whom the application was presented issued a Temporary Restraining Order without notice, although the recount was not scheduled to commence in Marion County for another five days.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.678" offset="1568342">Thereafter, Hartke amended his complaint and Theodore L. Sendak as Attorney General of Indiana was permitted to intervene so as to defend -- to be heard upon the constitutionality of the recount statute.</text>

          <turn speaker="donald_a_schabel" startTime="435.946" stopTime="692.693">
            <label>Mr. Donald A. Schabel</label>
            <text syncTime="435.946" offset="1817446">That was a point we have been trying to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.676" offset="1832388">On December 17, 1970, a hearing was held before a three-judge District Court and Appellee Hartke's request for a preliminary injunction by 2:1 vote, that Court held Article 27 of the Indiana Election Code so far as to applies to races for the United States Senate to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.460" offset="1911487">The Defendant’s motions to dismiss where denied and the interlocutory injunction requested by Hartke was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.549" offset="1947849">The majority and minority of the Courts subsequently filed opinions but made no separate findings of fact to conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.640" offset="1980241">Thereafter, both Appellants Roudebush and Sendak filed notices of appeal and on January 13 and 15 of 1971, jurisdictional statements were filed in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.551" offset="2027888">When the 92nd Congress convened on January 21, 1971, by unanimous consent of the Senate, the oath was administered to Appellee Hartke without prejudice to this appeal or to any recount that might ensue.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.366" offset="2087134">Thereafter, Hartke moved in this Court to dismiss the appeals as moot on the grounds that the Senate had already judged the case in his favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.238" offset="2118585">Then on March 22, 1971 this Court entered no corresponding jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.763" offset="2144708">Now, with respect to the jurisdictional question, there appeared to be two aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.496" offset="2163620">The first is the Court’s jurisdiction of this, a direct appeal from the District Court; this other aspect is Appellee Hartke’s contention that the appeals were moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.117" offset="2206148">With respect to jurisdiction, this Court’s jurisdiction of course is invoked under 28 United States Code, Section 1253.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.145" offset="2246272">Jurisdiction under this section depends upon whether the case was one required to be heard by District Court of three judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.525" offset="2275738">The authority to convene the three-judge court in this case rests on 28 United States Code Section 2281 which is set out on page 8 of Appellant Roudebush’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.989" offset="2321609">As contemplated by this section, Hartke’s complaint sought injunctive relief against the enforcement operation and execution of the States’ statute upon the grounds of the constitutionality of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.639" offset="2376257">So far the case is squarely within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.016" offset="2389736">But for 2281 to be applicable, the injunction must restrain the action of an Officer of the State in the enforcement or execution of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.682" offset="2444384">In this case, the duty to enforce the election recount statute is imposed upon the Circuit in Superior Courts to the various Counties by seeking to restrain the Appellant that is Roudebush from taking any actions whatsoever to affect recount procedures under the recount statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.125" offset="2518154">The injunction is thus directed against the Circuit in Superior Courts in which these proceedings were pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.962" offset="2545531">It has been recognized for many years that restrain of a party initiating that proceeding as tantamount to restrain the Court in which the proceeding was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.088" offset="2585968">Accordingly, it follows that a Three-Judge Court was necessary to enter the injunction sought against Appellant Roudebush because such injunction necessarily restrained the action of the Eleventh Circuit or Superior Courts and the officers thereof in the enforcement and execution of the Indiana recount statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.022" offset="2673740">Now, with respect to the other aspect of jurisdiction, I do not think Hartke’s contention that the appeals are moot need detain us very long.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.173" offset="2714386">First, the Senate itself sworn in without prejudice to this appeal and suing recount, so in their action and from their view point they judge nothing, Secondly, the term for deceit and dispute does not expire for another five years until January 3, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.326" offset="2799023">So I do not think it could be said that there are not live issues before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.165" offset="2826295">Now, so much for the jurisdictional issue unless there are questions from the Court.</text>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="692.693" offset="2844476">One question.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.639" offset="2848238">Is there anything in Indiana Law that would make it moot?</text>
            <text syncTime="696.994" offset="2861612">I mean, does the recount has to be a certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.199" offset="2874464">I know it is a certain time before but is there a certain time when you—well, could you have a recount now?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_a_schabel" startTime="705.965" stopTime="897.617">
            <label>Mr. Donald A. Schabel</label>
            <text syncTime="705.965" offset="2897557">Yes!</text>
            <text syncTime="706.707" offset="2900482">Because we were initiated within the proper time been suspended by this injunction and we are in the state of suspended animation right now, ready to go forward once the injunction is lifted.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.651" offset="2960251">Now, without regard to the applicability of the Anti-Injunction Statute or to the alleged unconstitutionality of the recount statute, the substantive question that I would like to discuss is whether the interlocutory injunction was proper under established principles of equity jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.690" offset="3028378">It would seem to be a hornbook law that Courts of equity should not act when the party has an adequate remedy at law and when he will not suffer irreparable injury that denied equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.899" offset="3073309">In this case as I have already said, Senator Hartke interposed its constitutional contentions in all 11 State pending recount proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.945" offset="3113433">Two of those Courts rejected his contentions and ruled against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.050" offset="3129838">He then had an opportunity to reply to the Supreme Court of Indiana for writ of prohibition to review those questions and if necessary had a right to appeal to this Court under 28 United States Code Section 1257 subparagraph 2, and bring the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.910" offset="3201309">Instead of that, being sought relief from the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.887" offset="3221266">But surely, relief from the Supreme Court of Indiana and from this Court would constitute an adequate remedy for proving equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.587" offset="3260032">Moreover, his complaint neither his original complaint nor his amended complaint makes any allegation concerning irreparable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.073" offset="3293991">Now, it is no answer to say that he filed a application for Temporary Restraining Order in which he tries to set out alleged injury because that application was not part of the pleadings, and it was not even served under Defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.065" offset="3353968">And I, myself never first saw it until I was preparing this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.114" offset="3378105">The Court below however held as a matter of law that Hartke would suffer irreparable injury and only authority would sign, it was Humpty Dumpy stating that the harm to be avoided would take place immediately and irrevocably once the case seals and the ballot bags are broken.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.066" offset="3457936">But the breaking of the seals in the ballot bags could not cause irreparable injury for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.925" offset="3481341">First under the statute, the Court in which the recount is pending instructed by the statute, can pound the ballots and make an order for their protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.354" offset="3519062">Now it cannot be assumed or presumed that that Courts is not going to do its duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.695" offset="3540482">Next, so long as the ballots are preserved intact, it is of no consequence how they are originally counted or sorted.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.489" offset="3583637">And finally, since the Senate is the Judge of the elections in returns of its members, neither the original count nor the recount a binding on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.056" offset="3629926">So regardless of what happens during the recount, if it is not binding on the Senate, it can not cause irreparable injury to Senator Hartke.</text>

            <text syncTime="1368.589" offset="5548045">The Lower Court further reasoned that the Indiana Recount Statute is unconstitutional and in violation of Article 1 Section 5 of the United States Constitution which provides very briefly that the Senate is the body which determines the election and qualifications of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.979" offset="5633622">Article 1, Section 4 imposes a duty on States to prescribe the places, time, and manner of holding the elections for Senators and Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.607" offset="5680120">It is our contention that the Indiana Recount Statute is more analogous to the counting of vote than it is to an election contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.454" offset="5731529">The Recount Statute although the Recount Commission is appointed by the Court and so forth, the Recount Commission simply retabulates the vote.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.891" offset="5825256">I think it is significant to realize that from the record, the Appellee chose not to take his case through the State Court procedure but chose instead to go directly to the Federal Court after having lost his case on the motion to dismiss in the Lower Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.446" offset="5935493">Two of these three decisions which are relied on by the Appellee were decided prior to the 1961 Amendment of the Indiana Recount Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.273" offset="5994739">The amendment provided that recount would be use for informational purposes and would not supersede any previously issued certificates of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.884" offset="6041237">Logically, the Amendment would apply to races to the US Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.248" offset="6066628">Since the Indiana and Federal Constitutions have primarily identical provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.661" offset="6100273">In addition, it is the Appellant’s case that a recount stands on the same footing as the original count, that a recount is merely a retabulation of the vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.106" offset="6150115">The Appellee will counter that argument by saying that, “Well, judgment is exercised by a Recount Commission”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.256" offset="6186687">I would answer that by saying “The judgment is exercised when the vote is tabulated initially”, that is which axis is within the circle, which is without.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.131" offset="6238200">If the vote has been cast by a machine, whether it has been counted or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.011" offset="6265681">The Supreme Courts of the States of Minnesota, Georgia, and Oklahoma have held that a recount procedure does not violate the provisions of Article 1 Section 5 of the US Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.452" offset="6315522">Providing the procedure is the intrical part of the Election Code of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.593" offset="6340078">This is the fact in the State of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.814" offset="6356900">The reasons for having a recount procedure are compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.476" offset="6379575">In Indiana as in many States, polls are open from 6 am until 6 pm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.580" offset="6411967">Members of the Precinct Election Boards have had a long day by the time the polls close.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.910" offset="6437358">However afterward, they must count the votes and certify the results to the Counting Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.863" offset="6469122">The members of the Precinct Election Boards in many cases are housewives, anxious to get home to the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.745" offset="6500678">What I am trying to bring to the Court’s attention is simply that the chance of error in the initial tabulation increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.840" offset="6541011">There is a direct relationship between the chance of error and the physical well being of the Precinct Election Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.264" offset="6582703">Therefore, it is incumbent to have some sort of recount procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.591" offset="6616035">In view of the safeguards present in the statute and the fact that the procedure is and has been an intrical part of Indiana Election Code since 1945, the Appellant respectfully submits that there is no conflict with Article 1 Section 5 of the US Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.833" offset="6688969">I will sit down if the Court has no questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.413" offset="6699313">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1731.919" offset="7001393">It was a contest as the Indiana Supreme Court has three times held declaring this very statute to be unconstitutional, before it was amended and after it was amended wherein the argument is made it well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.531" offset="7059803">After the Amendment, it became a discovery statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.496" offset="7071611">But in fact in Bachelorette (ph) cited by the our Court, our Supreme Court, the Indiana Supreme Court said “It violates Article 4 Section 10 of the Constitution of Indiana, which is the mirror image of Article 1 section 5 of the Federal Constitution”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.720" offset="7128558">So, three times, our highest Court that struck down this statute as saying that it could not apply to the members of the Indiana General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.447" offset="7159487">Now, there are 4,400 precincts in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.085" offset="7182056">They petitioned in 11 Counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.092" offset="7194073">440 precincts and 11 Counties are 4,000 plus precincts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.003" offset="7221658">In one of the Counties in one in which the principal case came up into the Federal Court, came over in the Federal Court, it was fragmentary, just part of the precincts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.024" offset="7261782">Now, the Court was moving.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.409" offset="7271291">Commissioners were been appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.705" offset="7276515">33 Commissioners were being appointed in 33 different State Jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.632" offset="7296159">As shown by the evidence and by the Law of Indiana, the Appellant’s party control every precinct in Indiana, all 4,400 of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.124" offset="7334193">By that I mean, the Judge and the Inspector in the majority party which was Appellants control every precinct, giving them the opportunity to make the original judgment as state of a Counsel as each person came to the polling place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.740" offset="7408590">In Marian County, the Election Board by virtue of the fact that his party had cast a highest number of votes at the previous election was controlled by Appellant’s party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.734" offset="7452580">The Canvassing Board which does check arithmetical errors was controlled by Appellant’s party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.400" offset="7483300">Now, in that atmosphere and I must be candid to tell you, every Judge in Indiana at this time was also selected on the partisan political ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.627" offset="7524156">Right along with the County Treasurer and the County Clerk, and our Supreme Court and Appellate Court Judges are like wise selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.227" offset="7550592">So, you can see the atmosphere in the United States Senate raise between two strong political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.991" offset="7573684">Now, that was the atmosphere, and the recount proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.801" offset="7588835">Alright, it was at that point that we had to look at the Indiana statute on recounts, which has been thrice declared to be unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2856.283" offset="11498843">We did not see any question of abstention or comity involved in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.456" offset="11519532">So, we went to Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.325" offset="11526951">We got a Restraining Order and then we got a Temporary Injunction after a full scale hearing where evidence was had.</text>

            <text syncTime="2896.158" offset="11658295">And, we cite many authorities and there is Court deposition that these were not proceedings in the State Court which were specifically prohibited under Younger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.046" offset="11697896">Certainly, they are criminal prosecutions and Watson versus Pig and the State Ex Rel McCormick, one was a Prosecutor and one was a County Auditor, and they described these people as a ministerial and I believe Counsel in appellant's brief concedes or at least argues the same way that these are ministerial proceedings, not judicial proceedings, or that they are not judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.719" offset="11780548">Now, the next question is of course, does John reply?</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.808" offset="11792878">We say no.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.323" offset="11798938">We say it does not apply for a reason that these are not State Court proceedings under 2283.</text>

            <text syncTime="3223.405" offset="12967238">That would be a new departure in some regard, I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.906" offset="12977269">But seriously, I do not think it means a thing constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.020" offset="12993779">I think he seats there just every other Senator subject to be in crude that he was not elected and the place that you prude that in the United State Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.652" offset="13024290">Now, that is the ruling Precedent at this Court in Barry versus Cunningham.</text>

            <text syncTime="3249.321" offset="13070997">Alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.394" offset="13075281">But they all fall back deceited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.847" offset="13081028">The Constitutional Provision in every State is very nearly identical to the Federal Constitution Provision Article 1 Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.155" offset="13106314">And, they all fall back to the same argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.732" offset="13116554">Well, the Legislative Body is the judge of the election, returns and qualifications of the member.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.075" offset="13137975">Now, we are talking about the election returns and qualifications of the United States Senator, why should they not be presented to the United State Senate?</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.854" offset="13173083">Why should it not be presented there in the first instance?</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.015" offset="13189697">We filed a motion to dismiss on this Court, the Court deferred the jurisdictional question till the day as I understand it, and I want to press strongly to the point that he is seated in under Barry versus Cunningham that I believe that in (Inaudible) this case, I think it is moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.728" offset="13248629">I do not think anything could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.775" offset="13280812">The State recounts as in the various -- there are all kinds of different cases on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.921" offset="13297322">Some say they are valid and some say they are not, and you have to look at the various State Laws to determine whether they would be valid measures in Article 1 Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.654" offset="13332326">But look at our recount statute and what Laxalt v. Cannon says about Nevada’s case and what Wickersham says about the case in that State or the Minnesota Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.771" offset="13384780">We know what the Indiana Courts upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.047" offset="13393870">They have held the statute unconstitutional, that it violates Article 1 Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.202" offset="13458445">Now, the Trial Court did mention as I said title 421983 of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.542" offset="13507869">We trouble ourselves with this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.222" offset="13514556">How do you go in?</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.663" offset="13520303">Assuming we are right that out here is a body, a Ministerial Body actually violating the Senate’s prerogatives Article 1 Section 5 which we thought we proved and the Court thought we proved and the evidence shows it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.720" offset="13572548">We meticulously put the evidence in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.131" offset="13582161">So, we would not get up here and say well, it is a facial argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.869" offset="13593132">On its face they say recount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.089" offset="13602014">So if on its face it says recount, if you can count them once, you can count them twice argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.286" offset="13618837">So, we said we got to prove that you do not do that, and we did prove it and the Court so found that this is a contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.700" offset="13648512">That moves it in to Article 1 Section 5, that moves it in to the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.340" offset="13667007">The important thing, I think that there is no question that the fact shows that the Congressman, Appellant Hartke and Appellant Roudebush had controlled the polling places as party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.887" offset="13725207">Had control of the Recount Commission, had control of the Canvassing Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.260" offset="13746732">Now they wanted to get into a further contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.518" offset="13755718">They wanted to go in to 11 separate Counties, isolated precincts at some case and rehash those Judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.386" offset="13783199">The Court found properly as the Indiana Supreme Court had found three times that that violated Article 1 Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.586" offset="13812038">We do not think it is a question of exhaustion of State remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.752" offset="13824682">We do not think the Writ of Prohibition was necessary, we think we can go the Federal Court and press a Federal Claim where there is no uncertainty in the State Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.761" offset="13852685">And, we did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.062" offset="13861880">Thank you your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3457.780" offset="13904825">Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.218" offset="13918513">I will be very brief but Mr. Justice Marshall already asked the question that I have in my mind, and that is simply if the Indiana recount statute is so unconstitutional, why did not the Appellee seek redress there?</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.140" offset="13990193">As far as the question of the seating of Senator Hartke in making the case before us moot is concerned, Senator Hartke was asked to step aside at the time the oath was administered, and a separate oath was administered to him in which he swore to abide with the constitution and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.612" offset="14080159">But subject to this appeal that is now pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.853" offset="14093116">It is our contention that this was a conditional seating and does not in fact moot this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.960" offset="14137524">The Indiana Recount Statute just one further point, the Indiana Recount Statute is in aid of the Senate’s power to judge the election of its members, not interrogation of it.</text>
