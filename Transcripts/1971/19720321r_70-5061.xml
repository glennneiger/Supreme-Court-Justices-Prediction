            <label>Mr. James B. Zagel</label>
            <text syncTime="27.745" offset="184704">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.260" offset="198706">We are here today to ask for the overruling of the United States versus Wade and Gilbert versus California, insofar as they established a right to counsel at lineups.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.149" offset="238307">It should be made clear that we do not ask for the overruling of Stovall versus Denno.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.987" offset="257638">Insofar as it established or affirmed a due process right of an accused to have a fair or non-suggested lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.591" offset="292015">We do not propose therefore that a person agreed by an unnecessarily suggested lineup should be deprived of law, state and Federal remittance.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.048" offset="333916">With respect to the petitioner's oral argument, there are at least four or five points that I would like to clarify, if I may briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.572" offset="375920">Petitioner in his oral argument has claimed that this particular case can be resolved on Stovall grounds, he assumes without any basis that we concede this.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.562" offset="415940">In fact, point one of the certiorari petition directly raised the Stovall's point and that point of the certiorari petition was not taken by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.541" offset="463796">The Stovall issue was decided in the appellate court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.937" offset="477380">It is available on habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.526" offset="491800">If the petitioner should fail in this court but it is not available, I think, to be raised here and now.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.955" offset="529520">In fact, if you look at the appendix, you will note that the motion is suppressed the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.580" offset="555956">The only issue abstract is the issue of denial of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.355" offset="571107">The only testimony abstracted is the statements of Bean and Kerby that they were not advised the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.242" offset="610605">The other point with respect to Stovall is that the witness Shard was not told of the fact that traveler's checks had been recovered from Bean and Kerby.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.718" offset="700570">The Appendix page 27 makes it quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.372" offset="715199">It is also quite clear from the record of Appendix 31 and 36 that the identification by Shard was instantaneous and that at the time, Shard was brought to the police station, he was accompanied by an officer who knew nothing of the facts of the case, had not seen the suspects and did not know who was suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.835" offset="813001">The last point that I want to make generally with respect to petitioner's argument on the eyewitness identification generally is, the petitioners argue that the eyewitness identification, the testimony in court is perhaps the most potent of all evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.217" offset="886562">They said, at least there is some element of irony in that argument when this case was initially argued, was argued on November 11th and it was immediately preceded by argument in another Illinois case, Lega versus Tumi (ph), which involved the burden of proof volunteering this little confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.006" offset="949674">I can clearly recall, petitioner's counsel in that case pointing out that confessions were by far the most potent evidence far off distancing eyewitness identification and therefore subject to increasing safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.196" offset="1010487">In fact, petitioner's argument that the trial identification is so crucial and so inherently suggestive, is essentially an argument that there's a constitutional right that would lineup in the court room.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.173" offset="1062418">It has nothing to do with the constitutional right to have a counsel at a pre-trial confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.244" offset="1102647">Petitioner also assumes, and I really assume as perhaps too weak a word I would say, (Inaudible) for a supposed concession by the respondent that the arrest in this case was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.490" offset="1155623">Again, I want to point out that this issue, the legality of the arrest was raised again at Point 3 of the certiorari petition, that was not taken by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.674" offset="1196374">I would also point that there seems to be a fundamental misconception in petitioner's reasoning with respect to this issue and that is, he assumes that as soon as we say that a confrontation was investigatory in nature that represents a concession that probable clause did not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.542" offset="1275891">Now, this dichotomy that as soon as probable clause exists, investigation must stop or procedures can no longer be classified as investigative in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.260" offset="1322703">That was raised once before and explicitly rejected by this court in Hoffa versus United States, 385 U.S., Page 309-310, in which the court clearly held that there was no duty to call a halt to investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.102" offset="1382053">The moment that the police have probable cause, a quantum of evidence which may fall far short of that necessary to convict.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.855" offset="1413086">Finally as one clarifying, and the ast clarifying point with respect to the reversal of the conviction of the code offended Bean, the reason that there was an absolute reversal in that case was because since the arrest of Bean was thought to be illegal and it should be clear that Bean was not in possession of Shard's traveler's checks and did not give the patently false and contradictory explanations of how he came into possession of those traveler's checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.074" offset="1553938">Since, Bean's arrest being substantially different from Kirby's, since that arrest was declared illegal, not only was the resulting identification suppressed by the appellate court but so too was that evidence of Shard's cards and identification materials which was found on Bean's purse subsequent to the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.726" offset="1652577">In effect, all of the evidence, both physical evidence and identification evidence, was suppressed in Bean's case and that is substantially different from the case before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.241" offset="1698657">That seems to me that petitioner seeks to avoid the issue in this case which is whether the admission of evidence of the pre-trial confrontation without counsel violated the per se Exclusion Rule of Wade Gilbert, indeed his oral argument thus far has been devoid of any defense of the Wade-Gilbert doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.637" offset="1788205">I am concerned with the right to counsel at lineups, the Wade-Gilbert doctrine is too prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.013" offset="1821746">First we think that the theoretical underpinning is unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.361" offset="1839091">Wade and Gilbert had, that a lineup a critical stage requiring counsel because the presence of counsel might serve to enhance the reliability of the lineup procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.517" offset="1883708">The concept of counsel as a surety for reliable investigation of crime represented a shift in the critical stage rational previously used by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.417" offset="1927385">This reliable investigation theory, I think carries too far, if it is applied seriously, it would require the presence of counsel at every stage of an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.820" offset="1968972">In our brief we discussed several common instances in which the courts have routinely refused to apply, right to counsel, among these are non-custodial confrontations, viewing of photographs of suspects, confrontations occurring shortly after the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.955" offset="2045458">It seems to me that counsel can be as useful in these cases as it can that the lineups involved in Wade and Gilbert, in one area of particular interest, that to which, I think, the amicus curiae will also go is that of the argument that counsel ought to be present when the police interview eyewitnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.171" offset="2130409">Frankly, if Wade and Gilbert's premises are accepted it seems to me a persuasive argument because that is the time when police presumably can engage and suggest the practices which were definitely a concern of instant need, the lineup cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.453" offset="2195506">That is the time when suggestions and other evidence can be planted in the witnesses' mind and indeed one court, the California Court, the Supreme Court has decided that in fact, counsel has to be present at interviews of eyewitnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.535" offset="2259872">Now, I think that under Wade's rationale, the right to counsel probably could be extended to grand jury proceedings and even frankly to scientific tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.689" offset="2300414">Now, it is true, for example, that in Wade and Gilbert, scientific testing was accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.604" offset="2320058">The court said, we are not going to insist on the right to counsel to be present when scientific testing of the evidence goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.212" offset="2358510">But the fact of the matter is, the court against the concern in the lineup cases with deliberate suggestion on the part of the police, a deliberate suggestion that amounts to tampering with evidence and that possibility exists in scientific testing as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.660" offset="2424338">Now, we have made this argument, frankly.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.664" offset="2432384">Our core that the rationale, at great length in our brief and I have no wish to deliver it here since we would not ask this Court to overrule the decision merely because its rationale seems unpersuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.320" offset="2491003">Our principal objection, is that promulgating a right to counsel at lineups, is singularly inappropriate as the solution to lineup problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.154" offset="2538337">So as far as we have been able to discovering the reported decisions, the purpose of counsel at a lineup is to act as a witness, and by his presence to deter unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.226" offset="2586611">The problems with his functioning, in this manner are manifest.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.023" offset="2613778">But the one point that I ought to make clear is, it's seem to me obvious, that no other function can be served by counsel at a lineup other than that of witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.455" offset="2651499">He cannot of course be placed in-charge of the lineup, under the decisions in Wade and Gilbert, he cannot prevent the line up and that this incidentally is a significant difference between lineup problems and those involving interrogation where defense counsel can effectively prevent the police from interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.900" offset="2729240">He cannot prevent the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.704" offset="2740525">His sole purpose is, that as a witness indeed, I doubt that interest of counsel is such that he would want to promote a fair lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.113" offset="2790157">It seems to me that the purpose of counsel, is to secure a lineup that is unfair, as unfair as possible, in favor of his own client.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.794" offset="2840835">His suggestions that he gives to the police, need not be accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.516" offset="2863718">The police of course can, I think have just concerns to whether counsel is interested in fairness, or interested in protecting his client, and I think a reasonable police officer could conclude that the primary purpose of counsel suggestions is not to secure fairness, but to secure some advantage for his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.023" offset="2941772">And of course, counsel is in a terribly difficult tactical position.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.451" offset="2959535">If his client is guilty, and I think it can be fairly stated that this is the case in most situations, he will be slow to attempt to if he sees for example, deficiencies in the line up.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.710" offset="3016482">He is going to be slow to attempt to clean this up.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.858" offset="3029125">I don't think counsel wants to validate the police lineup that maybe his only point, his only legal recourse to try.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.311" offset="3066951">And so far as we are aware there is no contemporaneous objection with respect to what counsel has to do with lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.088" offset="3094014">We know of no court that has required counsel, police present at the lineup to make objections to the lineup, at the time of the lineup, or forever waive his objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.658" offset="3140303">It seems to me that the law is clear that even if counsel is at the lineup, he can raise objections to its fairness at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.258" offset="3186696">So it is really very much, not in the interest of counsel to make objections, to make suggestions.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.607" offset="3228074">First of all, or rather next with respect to its effectiveness as a witnesses, it was thought I think in the opinion that counsel would be particularly effective and his client would not be particularly effective as a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.737" offset="3292649">I think perhaps, it is a somewhat of a misjudgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.669" offset="3324309">I do not think that counsel for a party will be regarded by a jury, or by a court as essentially more neutral, than his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.614" offset="3368090">He is not necessarily an expert in lineup procedure, in what is fair and what is not fair in a lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.674" offset="3404348">Since all he does, his witness to lineup itself, he will not have the occasion for example, to witness outside influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.485" offset="3439666">He will not for example, if he want to assume a horrible case, counsel may be present at the lineup, as the police lead the witness in.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.120" offset="3478118">The policeman might say before the witness where he gets into the lineup room.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.145" offset="3494314">That the man we think did it, or the man on whom stolen property was found, is the man standing second from the left.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.851" offset="3533080">Now, counsel will not witness that, and that kind of suggestion can be brought out only in cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.805" offset="3572890">And I assume that cross examination will be effective indeed, it was not difficult for counsel in Wade, or counsel in Gilbert, or counsel in Stovall, to recreate the circumstances of the lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.854" offset="3625135">Even though counsel in none of those cases was present at lineup.</text>

            <text syncTime="1275.756" offset="5176704">The more significant one is that the study in the District of Columbia which was done by Professor Reid in the UCLA Law Review, indicated that there were incidents of intimidation of witnesses, there were incidents of deliberate altering of the suspect's appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.043" offset="5253818">Once counsel had entered the case, and more significantly, if counsel for example, does attend the lineup, that is perfectly fair.</text>

            <text syncTime="1421.857" offset="5761116">I think what's even more significant is that the kind of an odd case, United States versus Randolph which is cited in our brief, which a legal aid attorney was called to testify on his client's behalf, and he was the man who was assigned to the police station to be present at the time that these lineups occured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.853" offset="5837080">And not only could he not remember the circumstances of the lineup, he had to go back to his notes to determine whether he had represented Randolph and return the next day and said that he'd represented Randolph and then testified essentially from his notes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1781.509" offset="7199731">I point out that that opinion and the language is contained in the majority of opinions was expressly disavowed by four of the six justices who joined in the opinion, that it is hardly reasonable to expect the states to rely and tell the police department yes adopt administrative regulations, deny a man the right to counsel and then wait two or three years to determine whether what has been done is constitutional or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.773" offset="7304743">The one existing case in which there was attempted is a California case, People versus Fowler, in which California police department attempted to adopt regulations and the California Supreme Court said that, yes administrative regulations might render lineups, non-critical, but only when such regulations were of such a nature to ensure that a lineup would be as accurate as ballistics or fingerprint identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.128" offset="7418219">Under that standard, I doubt that anybody could ever draft the administrative regulations sufficient to make the lineup a non-critical stage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1878.402" offset="7587284">California co- heartedly supports the State of Illinois and its contentions in this case that the rules established by the Wade and Gilbert decision should be reconsidered and that if not reconsidered, these decisions should at least be limited to the pre-indictment, rather post-indictment, post-information stage, such as was involved in the Wade and Gilbert cases themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.027" offset="7685818">Now, the California Supreme Court in People v. Fowler did in fact extend the Wade-Gilbert rules to the pre-indictment, pre-information stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.920" offset="7733360">Great many states have done so and that is why we have a particularly acute interest in urging that Wade and Gilbert be reconsidered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.533" offset="7771813">Now, rather than reiterate all of the arguments so forcefully made by the State of Illinois, we are going to undertake to support these arguments by references to various decisions of the California Supreme Court which illustrate the problems inherent in the application of the Wade and Gilbert rules to the post-indictment or pre-indictment stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.734" offset="7864600">Citations to these California cases are given in our amicus curiae brief and at the outset we want to make it clear too that we do not in any way question or urge any reconsideration of the Stovall decision which affords basic Due Process protection for a defendant regardless of the time of lineup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.352" offset="7951117">California in fact has its own decisions establishing those very same safeguards.</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.644" offset="8048293">In People v. Fowler case, as previously indicated, the California Supreme Court did extend the Wade- Gilbert rule at pre-indictment and pre-information stage and did so despite the following circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.763" offset="8100747">The defendant had surrendered himself to the police upon learning of an outstanding warrant for his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.572" offset="8128018">The lineup took place on the same day as the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.000" offset="8141707">It wasn't a situation such as Wade and Gilbert where you have lineup maybe 12 or 15 days after appointment of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.903" offset="8173263">The defendant had been asked prior to the lineup whether or not he had an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.609" offset="8192071">Although he was not told that he could have an attorney appointed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2035.072" offset="8214014">There is no question of that all of the persons in the lineup were male Negroes of approximately the same age and height and there was also identification by voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.795" offset="8256854">But perhaps also significantly the lineup was conducted in complete compliance with a six page set of regulations developed by the Oakland Police Department to ensure fair lineups.</text>

            <text syncTime="2492.856" offset="10045093">And what I think is so important to ask is what would the presence of the attorney due to ensured fairness of the trial that would not be accomplished by effective cross examination of the witnesses of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.210" offset="10106533">You can imagine the next extension of this Williams rationale to have the attorney in the squad room, in the squad car, or at the on the scene confrontation hindering possible police investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2537.366" offset="10223143">In fact most of the commentators who suggest rules of fairness suggest that the witness not make an identification in the presence of other witnesses and that this be left later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.315" offset="10270895">So I think that what's so important here is to realize the vast difference between the function of counsel at a lineup, and its function at an interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.236" offset="10322618">In a Miranda situation at least, the attorney can do something effective with respect to the defendant's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.140" offset="10346232">He can tell him be quite, we have a privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.812" offset="10360965">He can't do anything of that sort at a lineup because as Schmerber and Wade teach us, there is no right to withhold oneself from display for identification purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.069" offset="10409971">And that were not to be sold and indeed, one would have to think that counsel would have to be present at a blood test, at all sorts of various pre-identification procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.326" offset="10458977">Now counsel has no right to assume the role of a stage director, and casting the parts to be played or the stances to be assumed, or the phrases to be uttered in this lineup production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.586" offset="10504012">He can't stop the conduct of an unfair lineup, all he can do is be an observer and a very poor witness, a contrary to professional ethics which indicate he should not be a witness for his plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="2623.221" offset="10566601">No, but of course this would cause great complication, what if it's a post-indictment client, he is representing his client who really have to higher somebody else to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.295" offset="10610905">It certainly is a cumbersome method, I think without any great advantage to the defendant and in Williams, the attorney did have to take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.729" offset="10644551">As Mr. Zagel indicated what can counsel do to effectively serve the purpose of obtaining its client's acquittal, and by preventing identification he can urge the defendant to alter his physical appearance, the UCLA Article there indicates instances in which a mustache was shaved off, the hair was cut, voice was disguised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.139" offset="10738278">He can do these things which are suggestive as far as other person is in the lineup and which may in fact be unfair to the other persons by representing his client and he can intimidate other witnesses who have appeared to identify the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.725" offset="10792613">And this of course uses up a lot of time and energies of the police having the attorney there without really doing anything for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.414" offset="10831378">Now what I would like to indicate to is we've talked about the effect of the Wade and Gilbert rules on guilty suspects but let's consider what is the effect on innocent suspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.536" offset="10871816">The innocent suspect in particular has a common non-adversary interest with the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.014" offset="10897729">He wants to have an expeditiously conducted lineup which may bring about his release from custody.</text>

            <text syncTime="2720.626" offset="10956139">So to mean that perhaps the innocence suspect is kept in custody for another day or two while they hunt around for a lawyer and then it's released when he is not identified.</text>

            <text syncTime="2964.735" offset="11932596">Now, I would like to indicate too that what can an attorney's presence accomplish that could not be accomplished well or better by cross examination in conjunction with a photograph, perhaps with a tape recording or video tape of the whole processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.934" offset="12017442">Then in People versus Lawrence, the California Supreme Court did uphold the showing of a photograph of a lineup to the victim in the absence of counsel even though the defendant had previously retained counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.115" offset="12066134">On the theory that had the police cut out the faces from this photograph of the line up that these mug shots could have been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.667" offset="12100303">But that here there was no confrontation between the suspect directly and his accuser.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.238" offset="12126634">So this shows some of the conflicts because if confrontation is really the basic issue then why did the court in Williams say that the attorney had the right to go into the squad room when the defendant wasn't even there with the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.326" offset="12187029">Now, basically if petitioner Kirby had the right to have appointed counsel at the show up in a couple of hours after his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.581" offset="12220048">I think trial courts and appellate courts in the states would be very hard pressed to decide to draw any recent distinction as to when counsel can be had when if it can not be had at beyond the scene confrontation or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.862" offset="12281174">Well, perhaps attractive on a purely theoretical level, the rules requiring counsel at identification confrontations have presented these numerous practical difficulties in their application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.991" offset="12325687">Difficulties which were perhaps unforeseeable at the time Wade and Gilbert came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.303" offset="12346898">In light of the present experience, we submit that this Court should overrule its experiment of four years the Wade and Gilbert rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.613" offset="12388172">You have to ask in the end, what could counsel have done for Kirby?</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.793" offset="12404890">What difference would there have been?</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.360" offset="12411160">I think when you ask those questions it's clear that counsel accomplished nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.972" offset="12429550">So we urge the overruling of Wade and Gilbert on those grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="3114.418" offset="12531323">Now bear in mind that in this case Mr. Kirby received a sentence of 5 to 12 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.244" offset="12562670">So that when you weigh that as against a possible delay of an hour in order to obtain counsel, that is hardly a prejudice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3415.748" offset="13736717">Mr. Solovy, it was my understanding Mr. Zagel had answered to the question of Mr. Justice White, said that although Illinois wanted the way decision overruled, they also took the position that it could be limited to the post-indictment situation which as I understand were the facts of the Wade and Gilbert.</text>

            <text syncTime="3435.618" offset="13816129">That is correct Mr. Justice Rehnquist and it is our position that when they retreat, when Illinois and California retreats from an overruling of Wade and Gilbert, and state that Wade and Gilbert should be limited to post-indictment cases that we say that the State of California, Supreme Court decisions 6-1 and following apply in Wade and Gilbert to pre-indictment situations is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.914" offset="13913305">That all of the federal court should consider this case, applying Wade and Gilbert to pre-indictment situations are correct because after all 99.9% of the lineup cases happen prior to indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.429" offset="13983418">Now you take this case, for example, these men were not appointed counsel for eight weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.579" offset="14004002">Their right to counsel at a preliminary hearing was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.044" offset="14025840">Let us assume there was a lineup right before after the preliminary hearing but still no indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.427" offset="14051440">Now under the rationale of California and Illinois, Mr. Kirby would not have the protection of Wade and Gilbert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.179" offset="14090415">In this case, the man will arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.081" offset="14102014">You would had a waiting in the police station for several hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.268" offset="14114761">The State of Illinois could show no prejudice to having an attorney present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.124" offset="14134196">They say an attorney would be harmful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.917" offset="14145377">I don't believe that the attorney would help in the search for the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.155" offset="14162304">Now these two gentleman, two Negroes were seated in the squad rooms between two white police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.144" offset="14198249">And the State of Illinois says, that this was an instantaneous identification when the record says they asked if the two Negroes were his assailants and Mr. Wall(ph) in his book and identification which the court cites in Wade says this is the most grossly suggested procedure, now known or ever known to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.904" offset="14289259">Now what could have a lawyer done in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.211" offset="14298559">He could have said to the police, please have the lineup, please let's get at least four or five other Negroes into the room, and let them try and pick from five or six Negroes, not from two white police officers and two Negroes, what type of justice is that?</text>

            <text syncTime="3596.692" offset="14460414">Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, it seems to me without complaining that I would be unfairly treated for, that is Mr. Kirby would be unfairly treated for the State of Illinois to say and the State of California, you do not need Wade and Gilbert to protect the defendant because you have Stovall but poor Mr. Kirby doesn't have the benefit of Stovall because the grant of certiorari did not carry that far.</text>

            <text syncTime="3628.088" offset="14586010">If you do not apply Wade and Gilbert and say if the gentleman and the attorney, because there was no compelling circumstances here to provide him an attorney, then at very least, the Court must apply Stovall otherwise it would be the most rank form of injustice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3688.228" offset="14826546">My position Mr. Chief Justice, is that when you read the broad language of Wade and Gilbert, the rationale for the decision, the reasons underlying the decision and the language itself, brings you to the conclusion that the Supreme Court of California reached and all the Federal Courts have reached, and that is that the philosophy of that decision is that it applies to pre-indictment cases.</text>
