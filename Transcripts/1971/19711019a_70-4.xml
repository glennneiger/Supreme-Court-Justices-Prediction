            <text syncTime="2847.481" offset="11463984">As the Court -- the Court inquired about the basis on which the Supreme Court decision was made and I will quote from some of the provisions there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.997" offset="11546009">This Court had before said that the priorities established by the Code 15-312 are mandatory, leaving no room for discretion by the Court in the appointment of administrators, citing an Idaho case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.464" offset="11599925">Similarly the preference given to male by the Code 15-314 is also mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.920" offset="11625734">The statute itself says that males must be preferred to females.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.688" offset="11648722">Other Courts construing similar provisions have also held that the preference is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.354" offset="11675472">The respondent however contends that Idaho Code 15-314 violates the Fourteenth Amendment, the equal protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.004" offset="11722074">It is well settled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not preclude the legislature from making classification and drawing distinction between classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.953" offset="11757810">It merely prohibits classifications which are arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.410" offset="11779648">It is for the Court to determine in each instance whether a particular classification rests upon rational ground for as in effect without justification and arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.108" offset="11822489">It is equally well settled that legislative enactments are entitled to a presumption of validity and that a classification will not be held unconstitutional absent a clear showing that is arbitrary and without justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.644" offset="11900647">By Idaho Code 15-314 the legislature eliminated two areas or controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.529" offset="11924157">If both a man and woman of the same class seek administration, the male would be entitled over the female.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.311" offset="11959266">The same as relative of the whole blood is entitled over relative of the same class but of only the half blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.224" offset="11986956">The provision of the statute is neither illogical nor arbitrary method devised by the legislature to resolve an issue that would otherwise require a hearing as to the realty of merits as to which of the two or more petitioning relatives should be appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.914" offset="12061666">Philosophically, it can be argued with some degree of logic that the provisions of Idaho Code 15-314 discriminates against women on the basis of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.668" offset="12108686">However, nature itself has established distinction and this statute is not designed to discriminate, but it is only designed to alleviate the problem of holding hearings by the Courts to determine eligibility to administer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.188" offset="12174724">This is one of those areas where a trust must be made in a legislature about enacting Idaho Code 15-314, make a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.021" offset="12230103">Legislature when enacted this statute evidently concluded that in general men are better qualified to act as an administrator than are women.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.932" offset="12269705">A classification having some reasonable basis does not offend against that clause of equal protection, merely because it is not made with mathematical necessity or because in practice it results in some inequality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.023" offset="12334071">On even scale of the classification, such a law must carry the burden of showing that it does not rest upon an unreasonable basis but it is essentially arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.828" offset="12385375">And they go on to say that while a classification may not be entirely accurate and there are doubtless instances in which it is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.145" offset="12430619">They are not prepared to say it is so completely out of basis of fact as to be irrational or arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.719" offset="12468863">Then they go on to show what other classifications on the basis of sex have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.816" offset="12501254">It is our opinion, the State has a legitimate interest in promoting the prompt administration of the estates and that the statute in question promotes this interest by curtailing litigation over the appointment of administrators in addition to the support by the presumption of constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.051" offset="12598221">Appellant in its brief has criticized the decision of the Supreme Court and in his words, misquotes to say declaring that nature itself has established the distinction, the Idaho Supreme Court seemly justified the discrimination challenged here by finding it rationally -- rational to assume the mental inferiority of women to men.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.150" offset="12702606">Well, they rolled in the mental.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.183" offset="12706786">There is no statement in the Supreme Court decision like that and a Court does not think that.</text>
