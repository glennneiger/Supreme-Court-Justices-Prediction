            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73714">So first this morning in number 71-32 Curtis C. Flood against Kuhn and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.004" offset="153649">Mr. Goldberg.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="20.985" stopTime="1007.870">
            <label>Mr. Arthur J. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="20.985" offset="157619">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.894" offset="177263">The issue in this case is the legality under federal antitrust and state statutory and Commonwealth organized baseballs through reserved system.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.912" offset="237345">To paraphrase Judge Waterman's opinion in the Court of Appeals, this is a scheme which binds every American professional baseball player to one team or it's assignee for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.664" offset="296277">And which compels team owners to boycott the player or property of another team owner, and to boycott any fellow owner, and to boycott the player himself and blacklist him, who fails to abide by the agreement among the owners to eliminate competition in recruitment and retention of personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.403" offset="411321">The reach of the reserve system extends beyond the continental United States and even our new states.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.002" offset="449668">Beyond the 24 Major League Clubs which are defendants in this law suit, to 155 Minor League clubs organized in 21 Minor Leagues, to the Mexican League and even to Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.537" offset="543814">An American player boycotted by organized baseball today is boycotted by Japanese employers as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.810" offset="592924">Perhaps it maybe helpful to the court, if I having stated the issue now review a few of the pertinent facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.032" offset="629809">On October 8, 1969 Curtis C. Flood then a major professional ball player for the St. Louis Cardinals was traded, his contract transferred and assigned to another National League baseball club, the Philadelphia Phillies as part of the multi-player transaction between the two clubs.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.188" offset="730432">As Judge Cooper found in the District Court and I paraphrase him at the time of the trade, he was 22 years old, a veteran of 12 years of service with the Cardinals.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.858" offset="789051">Co-captain of the team by the election of his teammates.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.064" offset="805874">And acknowledged to be a player of exceptional and proven ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.571" offset="831996">About that the record is very clear, in his active service with the St. Louis Cardinals, he batted around 300, won several Golden Gloves competition, which is the competition for excellent fielding.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.090" offset="910050">And was regarded to be a great asset for that team, and as evidenced by the fact that he was being paid $90,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.297" offset="954876">Not a salary as we know from reading the newspapers that baseball owners throw away very lightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.216" offset="1006494">The circumstances surrounding his assignment or as Judge Waterman said in the Court of Appeals to use baseball (Inaudible) sale are rather interesting as part of the background of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.998" offset="1065636">Now perhaps that explains why he chose to use the Courts to vindicate his rights, although he had deep routes in St. Louis Missouri, not only with the ball club which he had served faithfully for 12 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.795" offset="1144839">He was also an artist who had an artist studio.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.294" offset="1162811">He had two photographic studios and franchises else where.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.910" offset="1185276">And he had many friends and family in St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.286" offset="1210772">He was not consulted about the training.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.342" offset="1227072">At the contrary he received a form notice and then a telephone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.768" offset="1264689">The form notice was a very cryptic one.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.028" offset="1277750">Record itself does not really display what it actually is, it's a printed form.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.124" offset="1306171">And in that printed form, there is a checkbox.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.023" offset="1325711">Your contract is renewed, your contract code has been transferred, you have been released from the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.913" offset="1373358">Perhaps, I would like to suggest Your Honors you might want to look at the exhibits rather than the cold record, to see how this form is filled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.689" offset="1416408">I should say at all fairness to my distinguished brothers on the opposite side, he also received a telephone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.508" offset="1463742">After the transaction was completed not before presumably, he had relinquished all of his rights to any consultation or disposition of his destiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.061" offset="1529884">When at the age of 15, he signed a contract with the Cincinnati Reds that without the without the assistance of an attorney which was the practice in those days and until very recently, until the 1970 contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.185" offset="1610445">He signed his first professional baseball contract for an average salary of $4000, which of course worked his way up the ladder, but he was playing last.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.651" offset="1668228">He enjoyed this very generous salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.118" offset="1686096">The fact that he was an exceptional player as Judge Cooper found in the District Court and Judge Waterman speaking for the Court of Appeals confirmed that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.188" offset="1734370">It was illustrated by his batting averages.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.083" offset="1754014">After he started to play full time in 1962 he had been there since 1958 with St. Louis Cardinals his batting averages were 1962 296, 1963 302, 1964 311, 1965 310, 1965 267, 1967 335, 1968 301, 1969 285.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.038" offset="1905838">I am not a great mathematician Mr. Chief Justice and associate justices, but this seems to me to be a batting average around 300.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.240" offset="1946589">He was also the winner of several Golden Gloves awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.381" offset="1967174">These are awards given to players for excellent in fielding.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.364" offset="2003118">He got this notice, this form notice without advance consultation, and he got the telephone call telling him that he had to uproot himself, his family, his business connections and move to Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.095" offset="2078037">On December 24, 1969 Mr. Flood wrote to the Commissioner of Baseball, respondent to Mr. Bowie Kuhn, the Commissioner of Baseball asserting his rights to negotiate with team other than Philadelphia and State.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.614" offset="2156091">And it's a rather interesting exchange, this was his letter in part, the relevant part, “Dear Mr. Khun after 12 years in the Major Leagues, I do not feel that I am a piece of property to be brought and sold, irrespective of my wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.011" offset="2229756">I believe that any system which produces that vital result violates my basic rights as a citizen, and is inconsistent with the laws of the United States and of the law of Federal States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="552.772" offset="2284718">The Commissioner of Baseball Mr. Khun replied, Dear Curt this is frankly reminiscent to me of a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court, which reverse the Hamilton case because a witness was addressed by her first name while other witnesses were addressed by their last names.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.416" offset="2371340">Putting that aside the letter read, “Dear Curt, while we agreed with the contention that as a human being you are not a piece of property to be bought and sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.925" offset="2417316">And this is fundamental to our society and could not see its applicability of the situation on him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="596.274" offset="2458798">Faced with the sale which he deemed to be an impairment of his legal rights and denial of his request that he be made a free agent of liberty to seek employment with other teams and without subjecting the new employer to boycott by the team owners, he had no recourse in his opinion, other than to mount this law suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.293" offset="2590873">And this law suit challenges the reserve system which permits this to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.418" offset="2627340">Mr. Flood adhered to his refusal to play for Philadelphia during the 1970 season.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.769" offset="2660777">Well, then Philadelphia sold its exclusive right to negotiate with Flood, to the Washington Senators after 1970 season concluded, and until the necessity compelled him to acquiescence.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.542" offset="2731830">So we have the reserve system, not unfamiliar to this Court, because this Court has passed upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.379" offset="2763177">I think wrongly in two cases and particularly Toolson.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.422" offset="2795360">I think a very accurate description of the reserve clause as contained both in the District Court opinion and in Judge Waterman's opinion for the majority of the Court of Appeals for the whole Court of Appeals, Judge Moore filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.045" offset="2861815">Judge Waterman in the Court of Appeals described the reserve system as a system and I quote him, “which pursuant to a nationwide agreement” and I shall say a word about that, clubs, baseball clubs effectively restrict a baseball player, if he desires to play professional baseball at all, contract negotiations with that club that organized baseball which firstly employs or reserves it, or with that clubs, assignee club.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.054" offset="3005907">Now in the subsequent assignee clubs to which in the (Inaudible) and I am quoting Judge Waterman, “he has been sold or traded, there is a more expensive treatment of how the reserve system operates citing the rules which govern the baseball rules in Judge Cooper's opinion in the District Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="763.042" offset="3125861">Now while I disagree with his conclusion, I do not disagree that Judge Cooper correctly describes how the reserve system operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.496" offset="3171627">Briefly, in addition to Judge Waterman's pungent and succinct description it goes beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.600" offset="3216036">No other club may bid for his services, once he signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.127" offset="3242158">He is not permitted to approach any other club.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.221" offset="3258563">That's called the No Tampering Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.433" offset="3271415">A club which violates this rule is subject to boycott by the other clubs.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.855" offset="3309032">In fact, any player that plays for another club which violates this rule, is subject to discipline, by the Commissioner of Baseball.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.436" offset="3363366">And it also extends beyond, Judge Waterman did not deal with clubs, the Major League clubs that extends the Minor League club, that extends to the Mexican League, that extends even to Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.136" offset="3446227">This is un-contradicted in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.925" offset="3465348">Now Mr. Flood stated out in 1970 and pursues this law suit, challenging the reserve system on several grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.091" offset="3514041">First, that it violates the Antitrust laws of the United States, second that it violates the Antitrust laws and Common law of the several states, and third that it violates the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution, of the United States prescribing that indentured service as well as slavery should not be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.381" offset="3647161">Now, as he stayed out in 1970 as I have said, he was confronted with 1971, and at that time Philadelphia the team that owned him, again I quote, paraphrased as Waterman’s opinion, “The team that owns him sold him to Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.340" offset="3739007">He agreed to play for Washington, he was there for a few months and we can all take judicial notice, I think of what occurred layman, lawyers and I believe this Court, he tried, he had been laid off for a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.083" offset="3805985">After trying for a few months in Spring training and in the actual season he was best, he could not easily regain his skills which is not difficult to understand and he left”.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.966" offset="3885502">Now, the transfer to Philadelphia, the transfer from Philadelphia to Washington was accompanied by stipulations between ourselves and opposing counsel that this was not connected to this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.349" offset="3943076">I am well aware however that private people cannot stipulate a case for this court, but the transfer did not moot this case and Radovich, the football case, this court held that the success of a boycott did not moot the case and furthermore he had experienced damages in 1970, and he had suffered impairment of his career.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.124" offset="4090197">Now, I turn to the reserve clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="3118.415" offset="12547288">Well, Your Honor, there are number of differences in the employment relationship between football, and baseball, and a number of differences in the sport, the character of the sport themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.652" offset="12588248">An obvious difference that receives much publicity is the option rule in professional football.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.092" offset="12609982">A system by which a player can declare at the beginning of the season that he desires to move to another pastures at the end of that season, he then plays an option -- they call like it the (Inaudible) option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.133" offset="12654181">At the end of that additional year, he is technically free to seek employment by another club.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.229" offset="12674556">The rule has another provision that says that any other club that signs that player must compensate to the club from which the player came, either in the amount measured by money players, draft choices, what have you, satisfactory to that former club or if a new agreement can be reached, that the commissioner will establish compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.240" offset="12754596">The Major League Baseball Players Association is announced this arrangement as essentially a fraudulent one, and in fact there's been a little mobility historically in football, and if one examines the collective bargaining process going on in football, one will see that the football players themselves denounced the arrangement as being essentially a cosmetic one, and not one affords them any real freedom of choice and then seeking their employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.792" offset="12860862">Other differences in employment relationship in football, and baseball, rather than football, the management may establish the rules of the game.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.528" offset="12895761">In baseball our collective bargaining agreement expressly recognizes the duty of the major league clubs before enacting any rule or involving in any way, player benefits or player rights to negotiate that rule with the players.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.463" offset="12947484">Also in baseball, there is an grievance procedure which has been agreed to with the players association, one that’s un-parallel by any other sport which places all grievances about club and player matters except those involve the integrity, which are reserved for the commissioner but the garden-variety grievance goes before, an arbitrator external to the game, a man now named Lewis Gill former President of the American Academy of Arbitrators jointly selected by the union and by the clubs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.673" offset="13056362">He has handled dozens of grievances in baseball, makes final and un-appealable decisions with respect to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.484" offset="13083634">And finally with respect to the differences in the character of the game, games themselves football for example, and baseball, football is able to reach out and plug from the college campuses players are ready to play professional football, already nationally known and skilled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.752" offset="13148627">Baseball has no such alternative, baseball has an elaborate minor league system, in which it develop its own players, and to which it devotes approximately 25% of the major league gross revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.381" offset="13199200">Something over a million dollars per year per club, poured into the minor leagues to keep the flow of players, to keep this player development flow operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.494" offset="13235667">There isn't any sport, any professional sport, that has anything that even proximates that sort of an arrangement, or those sort of expenses and difficulties of player development.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.914" offset="13281329">For all these reasons, we believe and the Players Association recognizes and they're bargaining with us, that the experience in other sports is, well not dissimilar from baseball's really, nevertheless neither is it a good guide for the baseball world.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.729" offset="13340574">There are important differences in the businesses and we feel and as I've said the players union feels too that we must work out our own relationships in the light of realities of the baseball business, not in the light of what some other sport may do, or some arid principles, but on the practical level, at the bargaining table, by the people who must live with results of their labors, the players and the club owners.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.766" offset="13588738">I don't know what what we would do at the bargaining table because presumably, not only the present system but every modification there too, everything that we might have work out in this area with the Union would be forbidden by the Antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.763" offset="13640669">And even if only our present system, not speaking of other systems were to be declared illegal, still there would be a third party at the bargaining table and that would be the court and the Players Union I think would be able to use that extremely effectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.587" offset="13696049">We would been buying a new reserve system every time we bargained and that the option would be that we would be faced with more litigation and wrapped with certainty, that probability that the arrangements would be illegal without their acquiescence.</text>
