            <label>Mr. Phillip A. Hubbart</label>
            <text syncTime="46.646" offset="260241">This case is here on a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida to review a decision upholding the constitutionality of a wander on this section of Florida’s vagrancy statute against an attack made and considered by the Florida Supreme Court and rejected that violated the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for vagueness and over breath.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.152" offset="350311">In this particular case the petitioners were charged in a criminal Court of record and in four day County at Florida by an information filed by the State Attorney charging the defendants and tracking the exact language of the statute 856.02 which is before this Court to review charging that a petitioners were “vagrants by wandering and strolling around from place to place without any lawful purpose or objective.”</text>
            <text syncTime="96.114" offset="458145">To this charge the petitioners entered a plea of not guilty and waived trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.640" offset="480192">At the time of the trial, the defense counsel made an oral motion to dismiss this particular charge on the grounds that the statute was void for vagueness and consequently violated Due Process clause for the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.999" offset="533691">That motion was denied and the trial judge made a specific finding of the statute in question “crystal clear.”</text>
            <text syncTime="122.561" offset="563889">He furthermore entered a written order in which he found that the statute was “constitutional” within the meaning of the Due Process clause of Fourteenth Amendment of the United State Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.052" offset="609864">A motion for new trial was is filed in this case attacking the statute not only in the grounds that it was too vague but also on the ground of over breath and that motion was denied and again the trial Court specifically ruled that the statute was constitutional within the meaning of the Due Process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.994" offset="669632">Question has been raised as to whether not the broadness issue was properly raised in the Florida Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.500" offset="691680">That was a contended on the motion for new trial and specifically rejected by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.488" offset="715608">On appeal, the Supreme Court of Florida in a 5:2 decision upheld the constitutionality of a statute and specifically considered and rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.886" offset="749254">In the opinion, the petitioner's dual contentions, the dual contentions made before this Court of the statute was “so broad and vague in nature” as to violate the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.286" offset="794811">The Court has granted certiorari on the question phrased in the petition for writ of certiorari namely whether the wandering section of the statute in question is so broad and vague in nature as to violate the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.792" offset="844862">On resolving that issue, I think it is important to examine first the exact language of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.110" offset="866073">Its legislative history and the construction given to it by the Florida Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="531.526" offset="2199781">It is based on a long line of English vagrancy statutes dating back to the Fourteenth Century which constitute some of the most oppressive pieces of class legislation ever enacted by the English Parliament.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.700" offset="2244503">And the words of Steven and in history of the criminal law of England, these vagrancy laws constituted the criminal aspect of the poorer laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.391" offset="2275223">The purpose of which was to confine the laboring population in England to Stated places and fixed places of the board where they required to work at fixed wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.350" offset="2311063">Furthermore the legislation prohibited wandering around in England and it was exclusively applied of course against the laboring classes in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.882" offset="2349201">Now, the Florida Courts have given some construction to the statute in the line with the decisions of this Court that the Court is bound by State Court in construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.519" offset="2387758">It is important to examine several cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.863" offset="2397162">Leading case is Hanks v. State, Third District Court of Appeal decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.549" offset="2415866">And that case, the Third District Court interpreted the terms persons wandering or strolling around from place to place to mean by any mode of travel whether on foot or in a vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.590" offset="2468006">In that particular case, the petitioner contended that he was not in violation of the statute because he was arrested in a stationary automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.000" offset="2501652">And the Court held that the mode of travel was in material and that one could wander and stroll even in a stationary automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.866" offset="2537178">On remand in Johnson versus State after this Court reversed in Johnson vs. Florida the Supreme Court of Florida reluctantly held that this statute had no application to a person sitting on a bus bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.957" offset="2589528">That was not wandering and strolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.880" offset="2597156">And finally the terms without any lawful purpose or object has been construed in the Hanks case to mean “without good or sufficient reason.”</text>
            <text syncTime="640.269" offset="2634772">Which we submit is even vagrant than the statute itself without good or sufficient reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.588" offset="2660058">And finally, the Supreme Court of Florida in Hedley against Oakwood’s has held that the statute cannot be applied against any person unless they are vagrants of their own volition and choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="693.352" offset="2847095">In the Court below the Supreme Court of Florida interpreted the statute and construed, it has been derived from “the genera of vagrancy laws” which have longed been upheld as necessary regulations to the term vagabondage and prevent crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.896" offset="2905296">And the imposition upon society of able body be responsible through of their own volition become burdens upon others in particularly their family for support.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.592" offset="2940091">And we submit that this section of the statute as construed by the Florida Courts is unconstitutional on its base in violation of the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.459" offset="2983559">First, the statute is so vague that a person of common intelligence cannot know what it is forbidden thereby in abiding arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the statute by State authorities and secondly the statute is so broad that it abridges rights protected by the United States constitution to the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and the right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.283" offset="3066837">The law necessarily enforces -- pretty clear, it has been Stated by this Court in the Conley case that the terms of a penal statute creating a new offense must be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it. What conduct on their part will render them liable to the court's penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.656" offset="3132248">And a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms of vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first essential of Due Process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.175" offset="3182403">And the Lanzetta case, this Court held that a vague criminal statute was void on space, regardless of the facts of the case, and regardless of the details of the offense charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.026" offset="3221796">Now the Supreme Court in this particular case has interpreted this statute to be a necessary regulation “to prevent crimes, to deter vagabondage, to prevent people from levying off other people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="803.220" offset="3286579">Now this construction of the statute, we submit is a frank concession that the law does not even purport to prohibit specific acts of criminal conduct but instead prohibits a vaguely defined way of life which is thought in the future to lead the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.816" offset="3352930">But it is clear that the construction of the statute is that it is not aimed at any specific acts of criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.121" offset="3378112">And District Justice Frankfurter took a narrow view of the void for vagueness doctrine in the Winters case pointed this out precisely when he said that these vagrancy statutes are on the class by themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.513" offset="3435686">In view of the familiar pieces to which they are put definiteness is designably avoided so as to allow the net to be casted large to enable men to be caught who are vaguely undesirable on the eyes of police in prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.851" offset="3489080">Although not chargeable with any particular offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.020" offset="3497753">In short, these vagrancy statutes and laws against gangs are not fenced in by the text of the statute or by the subject matters so as to give notice of the conduct to be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.932" offset="3537355">And that is exactly how the Florida Court has interpreted the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.354" offset="3551043">Namely it is designed to prevent crimes and not to act on any specific acts of criminal conduct and the Attorney General with commendable candor in this case has conceded, that this statute is designed to prevent crime not to punish crime but to prevent it before it even happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.404" offset="3631291">It is aimed at this vaguely defined way of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.794" offset="3640800">Vagabondage and wandering around.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.978" offset="3657623">This Court in Lanzetta v. New Jersey considered a statute which is rather similar to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.854" offset="3685103">It was an anti-gangster statute, the purpose of the statute according to the Supreme Court of New Jersey and the Attorney General of New Jersey was exactly the purpose as urged here in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.146" offset="3726272">Namely it was designed to prevent crime before it happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.852" offset="3741110">And in that particular case there was a New Jersey statute which committed a crime for any person not engaged in any lawful occupation and known to be a member of a gang consisting of two or more persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.193" offset="3786458">And this Court held that the term gang was too vague to withstand any type of constitutional test.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.243" offset="3810596">Now we contend that the term without any lawful purpose or object which means according to the Florida Court “Without good or sufficient reason is too vague to withstand constitutional test.”</text>
