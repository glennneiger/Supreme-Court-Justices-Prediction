            <text syncTime="67.946" offset="345520">This case was commenced on March 15, 1965 before the City of Emporia came into being.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.437" offset="383450">The litigation was litigation against the County School Board of Greensville County to require desegregation of public schools which it operated has a biracial school -- school system for the entire county including what then was the Town of Emporia.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.587" offset="456070">At that time, all of the county's white children attended the schools located in Emporia.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.239" offset="486686">There were two such schools, one, the Emporia Elementary School, one, the Greensville County High School.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.638" offset="512286">Both of which located in the Town of Emporia was at that time, and they were the only schools which white children in the county attended.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.853" offset="549066">The -- in other words, children who live in the county cross the line to attend -- white children who live in the county cross the line to attend schools in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.913" offset="585324">Some of the Negro children, the elementary children who live in the city cross the lines to attend schools at the county, all of the Negro high school children who live in the city cross the line to attend schools at the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.791" offset="620851">That's one school system.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.901" offset="773301">After four years of litigation, we prevailed upon the District Court to require a plan that would prompt us realistically to -- to desegregate the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.208" offset="818545">The essence of the plan was one that was proposed by the plaintiffs and that was to assign certain grades to certain schools and assign children other who lived in the city or in the county to the grade served in that particular school.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.748" offset="872671">Specifically of interest here, all the children in grades one, two and three were assigned to the Emporia Elementary School in Emporia, that then the traditional white elementary school.And all the children in grades 10, 11 and 12 were assigned to the Greensville County High School in Emporia that hadn't been the -- the traditional white school.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.748" offset="944664">And all of the children in those intermediate grades were assigned to the previously all-black schools in accordance to the grades that those schools had served.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.249" offset="974653">Now, immediately after the District Court gave approval to this plan, the City of Emporia decided it would take over the two traditionally white schools and operate them as a separate school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.801" offset="1028883">And the Court of Appeals has held, reversing the District Court that this should have been permitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.697" offset="1232429">Now, we think that Court of Appeals reached its judgment through a certain unfortunate distortions of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.812" offset="1256984">So, we have held to discuss the evidence at quite some length because we wouldn't like the same thing to happen here.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.863" offset="1281122">And first, we'll start with sort of an overview of the county and the -- and the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.770" offset="1308811">The longest is a small county, only 312 or so square miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.212" offset="1330545">Along the straight line distance were being measured from east to west or whether you measure it from north to south is a -- north to south would be about 25 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.441" offset="1367430">The county average is about 12 to 13 miles in -- in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.733" offset="1384671">This shaded area here schematically into some of the county is Emporia.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.770" offset="1404733">And the Meherrin River puts the west-east across and then right through the middle of Emporia and on and over.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.741" offset="1432632">So, in the literal sense, it turns out that all roads sort of lead to Emporia and the only bridges across that river are at -- are at Emporia.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.640" offset="1468263">The bridge that the local people used to use is the connecting link between North Main Street and South Main Street Emporia.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.963" offset="1497520">Another significant fact is which minimizes this question of transportation and so forth, every school in the system of the -- the high school is built for the Negro high school is located both here at the elementary school, one here over, one over here.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.139" offset="1570245">All of them within a -- a radius of two and a half miles from -- from some point in Emporia.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.819" offset="1588949">No school is more than two or three miles over town.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.966" offset="1601592">So, the distance travelled or the difference in distances and this problem are minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.146" offset="1626251">And between 1965 when this litigation was commenced, in 1969 when complete desegregation was ordered, the black majority of pupils had decreased by 223, from 2700 to 2477.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.305" offset="1682885">And white minority had decreased by 518, from 1800 to 1282.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.372" offset="1707126">This is the talk about the school system about 3750 pupils roughly.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.761" offset="1728756">As to that effortless litigation had been two years and going, July 1, 1967, Emporia obtained its conversion to a second class of status.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.380" offset="1775254">And we don't make a big point about the testimony that their purpose was to get a big -- better break of the sales tax proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.541" offset="1803884">But we do submit that whatever the underlying motivation for the transition, the transition was made subject to the right, the power and the duty of District Court to dispose of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.333" offset="1851009">And to accomplish the desegregation of the schools in the county including those that were situated in Emporia.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.085" offset="1873997">Now, as the law required, the -- the Emporia City Council appointed members to a newly formed Emporia School Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.155" offset="1902313">And that School Board function only in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.187" offset="1914434">It joined in signing the April 10, 1968 contract between Emporia and Greensville County of which the county was going to continue to provide certain essential services brought out this year in courthouse and even -- and specifically the public schools and the city agreed that they would pay a share calculated on a percentage basis for those services.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.650" offset="2000325">On the -- on the other function performed by the School Board until desegregation was ordered, was that the School Board met -- I'm -- I'm not sure if it was annually or -- or once a year, joined with the County School Board so that they could legally hire a superintendant of the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.812" offset="2056958">Otherwise, the schools went on, the County School Board ran the schools' business as usual.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.991" offset="2077647">As a matter of fact, there was no complaint, no question at all on the part of the city school officials of the City Council numbers as to the resistance that the county school was putting up to this lawsuit to desegregate the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.534" offset="2139819">And, even after the New Kent case, they now properly filed motion for relief in light of the New Kent, the County School Board was successful by one way or another by proposing plans that obviously would not work a series or everything that they successfully held of inevitable for a full year.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.185" offset="2214424">Until the District Court considering that the County Board had repeatedly failed and virtually refused to propose an adequate desegregation plan as to the plaintiffs would prepare a plan which we did in the sense that that's a plan that's in operation in -- in the schools right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.980" offset="2277641">And when the Court announced that it would adopt that plan and that also being made in June of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.226" offset="2310555">But the taste of a hard-worked victory didn't last very long because suddenly, final result hadn't been another ball game.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.250" offset="2338663">On July 23rd, when the County School Board sought to have the Court make amendments to the plan that the plaintiffs had offered, they would desire -- considered administratively desirable and they were not objected to by the plaintiffs.And the Court taking that matter on advisement was advised that the -- by the County School Board that they may have to come back to submit another plan if the city children withdrew from the school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.364" offset="2443153">And that remark the literate plaintiff's counsel to their counter attack that was then being developed by the City of Emporia.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.526" offset="2475753">We found that on July 7, the count -- City Council had sent a letter to the County Board of Supervisors and the County School Board and their legal adviser which the letter is printed in the appendix at page 56.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.629" offset="2524237">The letter takes note of the federal court's decision, desegregate.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.891" offset="2537298">And the second paragraph of the complaint and we'll quote, “The directive plan becomes even more unpalatable when the school records reflects those students of a city who attend to combine school system are not contributing to the imbalance which apparently led the Court to order school class relocations, bussing, et cetera.”</text>
            <text syncTime="638.131" offset="2626219">The county was by then better requested to transfer to the city the title to all school property sighted within the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.596" offset="2652028">And in return, the county was promised that upon payment of tuition, the county students might attend the city schools on a first come, first serve basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.943" offset="2689435">And we think it obvious that they were referring to the white students of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.060" offset="2705944">As if the -- if they had been anticipating the black students of the county also attending the schools had been no real purpose for their separating the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.316" offset="2738963">This is just one of the many evidences in this record justifying the District Court's finding that Emporia's decision to secede from the county was racially motivated.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.361" offset="2775117">From the beginning, the city's concern was with the 1880 black county children, two-third -- three-fourths I believe, were the plaintiff class who as the city officials sought, calls a racial imbalance which had required the desegregation order.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.292" offset="2830810">On July 14, 1969, the minutes of that time the appendix at page 62 and we think that they are the essence of the plaintiff's case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.716" offset="2860589">On July 14th, the City Council admit publicly on a special session.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.092" offset="2878039">They leave -- those minutes leave no doubt as to the purpose of the assembly was to the motivation as though -- of those who addressed the assembly including the council meetings -- the council members.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.173" offset="2914402">Merely announced and we quote, “The purpose of the meeting is to take action on the establishment of a city school system to try and save a school system for the City of Emporia and Greensville County.”</text>
            <text syncTime="722.805" offset="2964870">He further -- later said that the City of Emporia and Greensville County are as one.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.597" offset="2984096">We could work together to save our school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.415" offset="2995381">And cases came on to trial, the things that -- well, we had to say about the officials of Greensville County were -- were less complimentary and we get the idea that Greensville County and Emporia had been waging along -- long drawn out war.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.439" offset="3039476">By the time they're making this decision that at the time that they're under -- really under the impact of the federal court order, the city and the county wanted -- we can cooperate and still see if our school system and carry on business as we always have.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.381" offset="3087228">Mr. Langford to show the racial interest in -- in their decision of the racial effect in that decision, chairman of the city school board gave a plan based on Judge Merritt's ruling and percentages of Negroes at each school for the first seven grades if Judge Merritt's order would -- would be allowed to go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.847" offset="3169043">You cannot read the minutes of the meeting without seeing that the thing about which the city was unhappy was the fact that the District Court order was going to require actual desegregation of the public schools of Greensville County.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.901" offset="3221288">At the foot of page 65 and -- for me to say minutes, you'll see that Mr. Langford, Chairman of the School Board, told the Council that approximately 500 county children could attend city schools if the city obtained the buildings it wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.179" offset="3270398">They have only 728 white children -- white county children in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.694" offset="3288475">Now, a separate system offered the only way to continue to insulate these children from that mass -- of what we consider mass of 1888 black children who lived in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.440" offset="3335495">And that was what was to be accomplished at all cost even, and we get for the minutes, even if it required moving into temporary buildings and using makeshift equipment as amount of the separation.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.382" offset="3383247">Now, at the interlocutory hearing, hearing on interlocutory injunction some three weeks later, the man responses and city attorney's leading question testified that the primary motive, and seeking to separate was to provide a substantially superior education.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.315" offset="3442911">And once relate that the December plenary hearing, the City School Board exhibited an elaborately expensive budget which the School Board saw for the first time and adopted at a meeting held 15 days prior to the trial in which the city council saw for the first time and adopted the meaning two -- two nights later.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.986" offset="3517621">But in July, the decision to secede was made, the whole mark quality was a more palatable percentage of black children.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.160" offset="3554297">And the physical thinking reflected in the July meeting was the expression of the mayor that city system wouldn't cost anymore than they were paying being with the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.228" offset="3598601">And that they could take county students in on a tuition basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.212" offset="3614588">Nothing else in that meeting, only questions of adolescence sense was expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.863" offset="3629112">That was I think in -- in July when the City School Board was instructed to take immediate steps to establish a school division from the City of Emporia, and the city attorney was instructed to take immediate steps to effect the legal separation in terms of the equity of -- of the -- which the city and county had in the jointly owned -- in the jointly owned property.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.483" offset="3715629">July 31st, the City School Board published a notice to parents that they should -- city parents that they should register in the city schools and in -- but that notice invited the county parents to register their children on the first come -- no transportation tuition basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.898" offset="3777278">The city attorney wasn't quite so prompt in executing his direct there because it went until October of 1969 that he filed a suit to have the state court invalidate the contract if the contract was indeed invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.621" offset="3840181">And for some reason, the Court of Appeals was in the impression that the sequence of events happened at first in June of 1969, the city attorney advised the council that the contract was void.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.425" offset="3883440">And the city then filed action in the state courts to have the contract invalidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.563" offset="3899949">And then the parents were then notified that the city children would attend city schools has been -- the plaintiffs followed the supplemental complaint seeking an injunction, but things didn't happen in that sequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.291" offset="3938820">The notification to the parents was dated July 31st.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.655" offset="3952299">The supplemental complaint was filed August 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.294" offset="3962852">The hearing on the motion for the interlocutory injunction was August 8th and sometime after that hearing, the Council doubt this was advised that the contract might be successfully attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.825" offset="4000991">In the Court now on October 1st, the -- a suit for -- for that purpose was filed in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.902" offset="4025337">Now, there are erroneous empiric questions the Court of Appeals seems to have stemmed with the testimony of Mr. Langford, Chairman of the City School Board who was asked by the city attorney, “When did you obtain a lawyer who advised you that the contract was illegal and violative of the Constitution?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.815" offset="4080926">And his answer was in June.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.796" offset="4088867">But on cross examination, we devote that the advice was a matter -- something to him as an individual, he was not a member of the Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.642" offset="4120214">The chairman of the school board was not giving at a meeting of the School Board of the City Council or any other group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.886" offset="4141216">And when we read -- read the testimony that was being heard at the August interlocutory hearing, we find that the -- that the School Board people and the City Council people looked upon this contract as a formidable obstacle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.996" offset="4197641">As a matter of fact, we went back to the minutes of that July meeting in which the city attorney was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.892" offset="4217285">This followed the contract as being something that might be of a void by mutual consent or by annexation that makes you a territory from the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.516" offset="4247796">The contract had a provision had a provision that it would be terminated if the city did take an annexation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1089.315" offset="4430966">But, in another and perhaps more important aspect, the Fourth Circuit majority misstated the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.039" offset="4457820">The Circuit Court sought to ascertain the primary purpose of the city by looking to the projections of the numbers and percentages of the black and white students will be attending the two systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.326" offset="4507035">The city's witness had predicted a 48% black and a 52% white ratio in the city-operated high school, in a similar but in greater ratio in the city-operated elementary schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.645" offset="4548309">But these predictions link the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.426" offset="4559384">The anticipated return of 10% of the school population from the private school would increase the white percentage of the high school to 56%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.385" offset="4595224">This -- there is some talk in the testimony about annexation and they could annex outline areas of the county and -- and increase the white population of the county immeasurably.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.581" offset="6380015">I think at the outset, it might be well to remark that the facts is found by the District Court and by the Court of Appeals, should be looked to for a determination of what are the underlying facts in this case rather than to the suspicions expressed by counsel at the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.409" offset="6483355">And in this connection, I would point to page 318 of the joint appendix where the Court of Appeals says, “Notably, there was no finding of discriminatory purpose.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.620" offset="6540198">And instead, the quote note -- Court noted its satisfaction that the city would if permitted, operate its own system on a unitary basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.568" offset="6580008">Obviously, the case must be as it appears rather than as one might think it might have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.751" offset="6624730">We have listened here this morning to the Scotland Neck case along with the Court, and that if we may express an opinion, it is a strong case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.124" offset="6666212">We believe because of certain differences of substance at the case which Emporia has before you is an even stronger case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1699.725" offset="6872580">When the town of Emporia in the summer of 1967, became a city, automatically, it became a school district.</text>

            <text syncTime="2767.118" offset="11142137">At the time that we first proposed operating our independent school system, as a part of our hope of persuading the county to do that which it ought to do and that is turned over to us, the school buildings which rightfully should be ours, we included on a first come, first serve, no transportation basis on tuition, the opportunity for anyone who wanted to attend a city school system to attend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.432" offset="11267420">The District Court expressed doubt about the validity of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.624" offset="11288214">We said very well and if there is any question about it, if that shows any casting of doubt upon our good faith, we freely and willingly give it up, and we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.076" offset="11337951">I think that we have to view this case conceptually by going back to the basics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.530" offset="11375776">What constitutional right has been violated?</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.612" offset="11400122">Now, no constitutional right admittedly was violated at the time the Town of Emporia became a city in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.794" offset="11436903">And so, if a right has been violated, it had to be violated as a result of having a separate school system flowing from the city status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.815" offset="11492909">And you look at the school system and you see that there is a completely and wholly unitary system in the City of Emporia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.509" offset="11523734">You look if you will at the county school system and you see a complete and wholly unitary school system in the county.Nothing artificial in either case, nothing forced, nothing temporarily expedient in order to obtain some particular boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.321" offset="11610983">But the natural consequences of non-state action result in two separate school units, each having within it a unitary system, each with no predominance of one race over the other, but each representing the community which it intended to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.393" offset="11699277">Now, if -- if there is a constitutional right involved, it must be a constitutional right to a specified ratio because we're not damaging any other right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.981" offset="11757582">That must be a right to a specified ratio in some geographic area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.196" offset="11778480">We submit that Swann didn't say that, Green didn't say that, and Spencer against Kugler decided by this Court in January did not say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.293" offset="11834904">Where there is no showing of state action which produced a ratio pattern in a community and certainly inside of South Virginia based no racial pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.053" offset="11889866">There is a -- it is a completely intermixed community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.062" offset="11913899">No one in Emporia lives over three blocks from someone of a different race.He just -- it's just that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.558" offset="11951933">So, not only is no state action creating a racial pattern, it doesn't exist just as in Kugler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.943" offset="11985474">Just as in Kugler, the boundary lines of the City of Emporia were not drawn in an attempt to gerrymander in or out anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.401" offset="12035316">And when I mentioned that, I'm reminded of the fact that enclosing counsel for the plaintiffs mentioned something about 75% of the children being included out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.251" offset="12086725">25% of his plans are included in a substantially better system which is the uncontradicted evidence in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.515" offset="12127789">And certainly, they are entitled to rights where a unitary school system can bring about a better school system, then it ought to be implemented too often.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.373" offset="12191215">I feel assure you have the arguments before you that the unitary school system is going to bring about a poorer school system.</text>
