            <text syncTime="32.824" offset="205367">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.269" offset="219160">The case comes to this Court on an appeal from the First Circuit the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.799" offset="245282">This Court noted probable jurisdiction on March 1st, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.585" offset="268375">The case started factually on April 6th of 1967, when the appellee Mr. Baird, addressed group of people, mostly students at Boston University, pursuant to an invitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.923" offset="325739">Approximately 2,000 people were in attendance.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.140" offset="342667">At that time, Mr. Baird used to give a demonstration boards in his lecture on “Contraception.”</text>
            <text syncTime="77.134" offset="382582">These demonstration boards had various contraceptive devices and alongside of the lectern, there was a cotton box filled with various other contraceptive devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.872" offset="437544">After the lecture, he invited the people to come to the lectern, and in grab bag fashion, take what they wish from this cotton.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.355" offset="483519">He then, I repeat it was after the lecture, he then handed a can of Emko, an admittedly contraceptive device to a young lady.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.032" offset="526255">Now, I do want to bring to the Court's attention, an inaccuracy in the Appellant’s brief, in the reference made to this young lady as being unmarried.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.158" offset="570664">The record does not indicate nor did the Commonwealth at this time introduce evidence tending to show that she was unmarried.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.490" offset="640045">It is not however, significant to the case, but I do want to point out the inaccuracy and the correction made by Mr. Balliro in his brief, the original brief, is well taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.301" offset="687274">Repeatedly doing the lecture, the appellee, Mr. Baird, invited the police to arrest him.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.559" offset="712352">He said, “Why do not you arrest me officers, I am violating your Massachusetts Law?”</text>
            <text syncTime="164.456" offset="731891">Finally, when he handed this can of Emko to this particular young lady, the police complied with his wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.979" offset="761984">Now, the appellee was charged in two indictments returned by the Suffolk County Grand Jury, for the violation of Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 272, Section 21 which among other things prohibits the giving away and the exhibition of, to use the words of the statute, articles intended for the prevention of conception.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.990" offset="858010">After the Trial in Suffolk Superior Court, jury waived he was found guilty and the Trial Judge reported the case to the Supreme Judicial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.604" offset="892492">One indictment charged, the defendant with exhibiting contraceptive devices in violation of the statute and the other charged him with the giving away.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.083" offset="930422">Now, there are other words in there which are not important to us such as selling, lending and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.466" offset="951947">Two words that are important, are exhibiting and giving away.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.157" offset="970755">The Supreme Judicial Court reversed the conviction of that under the indictment charging him with exhibiting because in its opinion, it clearly violated his First Amendment rights, particularly the freedom of speech right.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.820" offset="1025403">However, by divided court, he had sustained the conviction under the indictment charging the giving away of the can of Emko.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.384" offset="1447646">The Trial Court then sentenced the defendant to three months in health correction, stayed that sentence pending appeal to the Supreme Judicial Court and a further stay was granted while a petition for certiorari was addressed to this Court to the Supreme Judicial Court and was denied and Mr. Baird then started serving his three months and I believe he served 34 or 35 days of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.488" offset="1556002">When the Second Court of Appeals, and I am getting ahead of myself, in addressing himself to a petition for writ of habeas corpus to the District Court, the District Court I might say denied the petition for the writ, Second Court of Appeals, for the First Circuit issued a stay for a probable cause and released the appellee on bail since he had served, I believe 34 or 35 days of his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.689" offset="1660806">This case then is in the posture of Appeal directly from that order of the First Circuit, and I would add that in both cases, the District Court Judge filed an opinion which we find in the appendix, and of course the Circuit Court filed an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.803" offset="1713259">Now, there are two questions that I think are addressed to this Court, and the first is, whether the Massachusetts Statute, and when I say statute, of course I must include a reading together of the two, whether or not the Massachusetts statute prohibiting it, the giving away of admittedly contraceptive substance, whether or not that is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.576" offset="1808345">And secondly, whether or not the Massachusetts statute is unconstitutional as applied to William Baird, who was admittedly a married man and who was admittedly also not a physician nor a Nurse nor a Registered Pharmacist or clearly not a Public Health Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.693" offset="1872815">I would like to address myself to the second question first and that is, the question of whether or not William Baird has standing to raise this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.844" offset="1913462">Now, he is admittedly a married man.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.588" offset="1924433">He is in effect asking this Court, and even cursive reading of the brief I think indicates this, he is asking this Court to declare unconstitutional a statute as it applies to others because clearly his constitutional rights are not invaded.</text>

            <text syncTime="1228.690" offset="4988806">I would be the first to concede the lack of success that this statute has had with respect to what the founders or the legislature thought in 1879 and the language that was used in the Allison case for a solid and moral citizenry, I am the first to admit that it has certainly not succeeded, but I do question whether or not the lack of success of the statute is any reason for declaring it unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.876" offset="5089534">I think it is factious I repeat to say that it does not have a logical albeit perhaps unsuccessful connection with public morality not to mention public health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.760" offset="5133106">I think to say that, to lift the ban to say that because I can think of only of quick parallel, but I do not suppose anybody would seriously contend that because gambling goes on, illegal gambling goes on in 80% of the, let us say variety stores or bar rooms in Massachusetts that therefore the gambling statute is unconstitutional because it is not working out for the anti-gambling statute and I think the analogy is not too far from here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1304.750" offset="5293080">Now, all of these things, as facts of course must go controverted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1312.390" offset="5323591">I think however, where he fails is, in asking you to draw a nexus between the failure, for example, the high illegitimacy rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.201" offset="5366850">Now, conspicuously absent from his brief, is any study that would indicate that in jurisdictions where the Legislature has seen to relax the law on contraceptions and permit a free distribution of contraceptives, that in those jurisdictions, the illegitimacy rate is any better or any lower and that is significantly absent I think conspicuously so from my brother’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.274" offset="5479176">He is putting forth these social evils, all of which we -- and I think would -- but failing to tie them in with the ban of this Massachusetts Statute has on the free distribution of contraceptives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.261" offset="5547095">The other argument that I would and I think is important here is, he keeps stressing the fact that nobody pays any attention to it anyway, and I have alluded this moments ago, but I would say that, I think it is important enough to repeat that, that cannot be the measure of whether or not this statute is within the framework of the police power, the Massachusetts has, it just cannot be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.361" offset="5663496">Now, there is one argument that I would like to address with respect to the supplemental brief, in appendix, through no fault of my brother, I did not receive this until Monday, in the supplemental brief of the appellee, there was one argument advanced here with respect to an Act of the Congress, a law that was passed in December of 1970, entitled Family Planning Services and Population Research Act of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.310" offset="5791287">Now, the gist of the argument here is that the Supremacy Clause of the Sixth Amendment, now will make the Massachusetts law on this totally inoperative of something of an occupation of the field argued.</text>

            <text syncTime="2062.442" offset="8323806">Let me take it a step further Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.389" offset="8335614">This statute says, that you cannot get a prescription for a non-prescriptive, non-dangerous contraceptive like Emko Foam or a condom unless you go to a doctor, unless the sole purpose is for venereal disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.118" offset="8406562">So the poor mother, let us say, the poor married mother for the time being, without regard to the unmarried woman, she is not going to have $5 or $10 to go down to a doctor and get a prescription, and go down and get a can of Foam.</text>

            <text syncTime="2112.072" offset="8522337">You have got the situation where until 1966, Mr. Chief Justice, this statute did not even hold out any relationship to health whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.000" offset="8558072">It said that no woman, married or unmarried could receive a contraceptive from anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.984" offset="8582001">Now, they put in that second statutory clause about a married woman and a doctor’s prescription and so forth, after the Griswold decision, but they try to tailor it absolutely as closely as they could without any relationship to a health measure.</text>
