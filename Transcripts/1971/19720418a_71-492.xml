            <text syncTime="60.142" offset="314263">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.784" offset="332862">This case is here upon the issuance of a writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.734" offset="376643">The case involves a controversy between shopping center owner and an anti-war handbiller.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.727" offset="420633">I believe, if I am able to properly describe the factual situation in this case, it will be found not to be the same factual situation as in Marsh against Alabama, nor in Logan Valley, nor in Central Hardware.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.472" offset="515614">The petitioner, Lloyd Corporation is the owner of a number of pieces of land divided by public streets in Portland, Oregon, used for shopping centers, as a shopping center, and known generally as Lloyd Center in Portland, Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.504" offset="611640">The respondents in this case are individuals who represented, what they termed the resistance, advocating resistance to the military draft.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.770" offset="664721">Their handbills were anti-war, anti-draft handbills.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.693" offset="696486">These respondents sought to distribute their handbills on certain portions of petitioner's land, in a mall or walkway, in the main building of the the petitioner in Lloyd Center.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.318" offset="770987">May I refer briefly to the Appendix in which we have copied photographs of the center map, and there is a map, first, center at Page 115.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.787" offset="840787">I would -- also at Page 116 is an aerial photograph, Exhibit number 4 of the center and similarly another aerial photograph at Page 117.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.788" offset="916855">The area, that is the entire area including the various buildings and the public streets in the center and the main building, are said to be something in the neighborhood of 50 acres.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.499" offset="995640">Yes, there are, they run through the various parts of the center, Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.756" offset="1024689">None run through the main building which is really the subject of this particular handbilling.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.584" offset="1047990">Are the public streets identifiable in any way, marked in any way that we see them on here?</text>

            <text syncTime="256.130" offset="1098145">There are pictures of the malls and of the public areas, but I don't think that there is a picture of the street as such.</text>

            <label>Mr. George Black Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="276.740" offset="1180587">Yes, the map that I understood you mean in addition to that map at Page 115.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.491" offset="1207650">That will show the public streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.616" offset="1216114">I think, probably it will answer your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.037" offset="1225831">That's Exhibit number 3, and referring to it, you will note that the center on the north is bound by what is known as Broadway.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.209" offset="1262507">A next street that runs through the center is known as Weidler Street, a second one proceeding on down the map is known as Halsey Street, and on the West or left-hand side, the map as one is looking at it, at the 9 street, on the East is I think 16th Avenue and on the South, bottom part of the map here, what you will notice is Multnomah Street, plus an indentation of a public park called the Holiday Park and some other streets, referring further to this map which maybe is the easiest way to explain this.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.459" offset="1443484">There is a dark line around the perimeter of Lloyd center which includes the private areas and the public areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.832" offset="1489041">That perimeter is approximately one-and-a-half miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.222" offset="1518612">With reference to the -- this was not a suburban operation as such, when it was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.852" offset="1545048">These lots and streets were there at the time Lloyd bought that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.112" offset="1586112">Not in the Appendix but in the record, is a map of the City of Portland, which I think, is number 3(a), the Exhibit 3(a), which shows the approximate location here of Lloyd Center in the City of Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.002" offset="1689662">If I may take a moment to further describe this particular area, I’ve applied out that when there is some 39 blocks, and the blocks there are 200 feet by 200 feet with streets on each side of them, some 39 blocks were intended to be devoted to this enterprise in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.205" offset="1794465">There were certain vacation of the streets in some of the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.110" offset="1818080">It will be noticed on the map, and to the large building, there was not a vacation of other streets in the area and instead Lloyd corporation following usual provisions of this city or ordinance of Portland, donated and dedicated other properties to permit the widening of the streets and sidewalks in other parts of the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.317" offset="1926958">I don't think that street vacation question is material in this case but it may be considered material by the respondents in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.253" offset="1974710">The construction of the center which is important so I would give it one more moment here, there were two buildings built with streets adjoining them.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.774" offset="2032806">At the top of the map, there were two more buildings built later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.899" offset="2049316">Then another building, each with public street surrounding them and then the large building which we call the main building, which has in it, what has been referred to as a mall or a walkway, a lobby, a corridor or whatever one got to think.</text>

            <text syncTime="743.462" offset="3047507">When Logan Valley was decided, I think, it was about March in 1968, we changed our policy to permit any handbilling that could come in there, that wanted to come in there, if it was related directly in its purpose to some use that was being made there of the premises by Lloyd Corporation or by its tenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.806" offset="3136950">For example, picketing would have been permitted and actually was conducted inside of the mall, where the relationship factor was present, and also where it was -- there was not an alternative because and it was necessary to allow the person to come in to get to the particular store.</text>

            <text syncTime="796.196" offset="3258471">So that policy was changed and in the Fall of 1968, November, 1968, some six months after the Logan Valley case, this incident occurred in which the respondents, as I have stated, they were advocating what they called the resistance, anti-war.</text>

            <text syncTime="2189.266" offset="8830703">Now, this main part of the shopping center, this former 18 square block area, is as the evidence shows, the portion of the shopping center which gets the main traffic, both in terms of pedestrian traffic, in terms of automobile parking, and this sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.318" offset="8902906">There are other portions of the shopping center, but this is the main portion of it where the handbilling took place.</text>

            <text syncTime="2344.512" offset="9451686">As the District Court found below, the malls and walkways within the shopping center are open to the public at all times, those malls, the principal malls run north and south and east and west, and they are about 50 feet wide in some of the photographs, the plaintiff's Exhibit 11, and some of the photographs offered by the other side, also in the Appendix show and these broad malls and walkways within the shopping center.</text>

            <text syncTime="2407.237" offset="9702671">You can see some of the parking on the following page in the aerial photograph.</text>

            <text syncTime="2414.565" offset="9731928">In addition to that, there is also a lower level of parking, which you cannot see on this photograph, that underlines so far as I know, the entire18 block area except for the skating rink, I think, which goes down into the ground further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.503" offset="9787725">So there is underground parking, under this entire 18 block area, substantially, in additional to parking you see on the upper level on Exhibit 4.</text>

            <text syncTime="2532.564" offset="10203908">As one of the questions indicated, the Lloyd Corporation has permitted a variety of outside activities to take place, non-profit activities on its malls and walkways of its shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.372" offset="10255213">Some of these involve great crowds of people, such as football rallies, political rallies for presidential candidates, various kinds of displays, musical performances, there is evidence that they once had a crowd of 20,000 people there in the shopping center for an (Inaudible) concert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.278" offset="10330759">Someway the auditorium is used as I mentioned before on a non-rental basis, with the Lloyd Center’s Corporation's permission, by some groups, Cancer Society, Campfire Girls, Girl Scouts, but it rents out on charged basis to other groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.958" offset="10393557">In any event, there are large number of outside people coming to the shopping center to use that auditorium or participate in some activity taking place there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.005" offset="10433681">They have also permitted a number of charitable, frankly, charitable solicitations which the court below found, were not put on to induce customer motivation, but were put on because the Lloyd Center thought they were worthwhile charities, such as the Salvation Army, the Volunteers of America, the American Legion selling Buddy Poppies and the like, other groups, similarly considering themselves charities, very few such permissions such as the record shows, the March of Dimes and Hidatsa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.535" offset="10559800">Now, coming to the incident question, the police officers are employees of the corporation and they do hold that commissions where a copy of which is an evidence, vesting them with full police authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.249" offset="10610687">That comes out of the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.746" offset="10616643">I have no doubt that these police officers have the same authority as a regular policeman does in the City of Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.671" offset="10648408">I also have, I think it is clear in the record, that these policemen as the District Court found, caused the plaintiff to believe that they would be arrested for trespass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.405" offset="10691249">If they did not cease and desist, from their handbilling and go out to the exterior public sidewalks, which they did, in order to avoid arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3652.611" offset="14684117">Well first of all, I limit it to the business districts, secondly I limit it to the functional equivalence of sidewalks, in the sense that sidewalks, they are using -- they are being used to carry pedestrian traffic between businesses within the business district and I think that you have then got to the functional equivalent provided that couple of other conditions don't exist, like in Taggart v. Weinacker, is apparently a sidewalk there was so narrow that any exercise of First Amendment speech or whatever would have unreasonably interfered with the owner's use of the property normally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.221" offset="14842524">I can concede that, in that situation, the property right balance is greater than the right of free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.275" offset="14870736">Similarly, if the physical conditions are such that I can distribute my leaflet to to everyone, Justice Marshall was talking about, that are going to be on a sidewalk and I can distribute it to everyone of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.962" offset="14921518">Then there is no need for me go a private property to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.040" offset="14937818">I can do it just as easily on that public sidewalk but I think this record shows that there are a substantial number of people, that are not going to be reached by distributing on the public sidewalk, around the shopping center.</text>

            <text syncTime="3748.835" offset="15069058">It is also conceivable to me that Lloyd Corporation or the City of Portland, may adopt regulations that prevent people from handing out leaflets in any manner that harasses these people, so that you must do it if you do it at all peacefully.</text>

            <text syncTime="3793.897" offset="15249303">Well, I agree that in First Amendment cases, even on public sidewalks that there are difficulties of regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.444" offset="15271454">This court has had many cases like Cox v. New Hampshire, Schneider v. State, all of this line of cases where you have got permits and the question is, is the permit valid or the statute valid because it's too broad or too vague, are difficulties in regulating anything relating to First Amendment, speech and activity.</text>
