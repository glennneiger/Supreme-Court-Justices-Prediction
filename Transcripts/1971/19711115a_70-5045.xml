            <text syncTime="320.254" offset="1354668">On December 15, 1969, they were sent a letter from their landlord’s attorney demanding them to pay rent or vacate.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.055" offset="1389881">At this point, they were faced with the realities of having an eviction action filed against them, pursuant to the statute under attack in this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.378" offset="1423214">There was no question that an eviction would cause the Lindseys irreparable harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.424" offset="1443380">Evictions of low-income families often result in a continuing downward and tightening spar which they find an emotional block to overcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.828" offset="1477026">They do not have the cost of moving and they cannot find housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.851" offset="1493117">They are often forced into less adequate housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.783" offset="1504820">They lose standing in the community and in their children’s eyes and large families are often split up.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.244" offset="1530629">In this background, this action was filed in the Federal District Court prior to any eviction action being filed by the Lindsey’s landlord.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.942" offset="1565424">The best way to describe the operation of the eviction statute is by taking the Lindseys through their eviction, had one been filed by their landlord.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.846" offset="1601055">A complaint and summons would be filed and served upon the Lindseys, setting the time for trial within two to four days which may include weekends.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.812" offset="1672944">I am using the Lindseys as what would happen to describe the operation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.525" offset="1695828">For example, they could be served on a Friday with a trial set on Monday or Tuesday.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.747" offset="1712650">However, two days is all the time for trial that the tenant has a matter of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.359" offset="1739086">Within this time, they would have to contact the lawyer, make an appointment and get him to take the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.996" offset="1769702">His first move would be to ask for continuance and all that he could get without posting cash security would be two days, the granting of which is only the discretionary under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.296" offset="1818812">Even though that defenses that Lindseys would like to raise would not be heard by the Oregon Courts because of the statute he is challenging.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.842" offset="1849010">He might still have conventional defenses based upon issues of fact, regarding what rent was agreed to or if it were truly paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.995" offset="1881610">Litigation of these issues may well require interviewing potential witnesses, subpoenaing them, legal research and trial preparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.051" offset="1917868">At trial, Lindsey would want to raise defenses based upon his landlord’s refusal to obey the housing codes, but these defenses will not be heard or adjudicated on their merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.847" offset="1969068">The reason for this is found on the face of the Oregon statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.659" offset="1984324">They provide that the landlord’s complaint is sufficient as it states: (1) A description of the premises, (2) That the defendant is in possession, (3) That the defendant unlawfully holds by force which is deemed to include failure to pay rent within 10 days after it is due,and (4) that the landlord is entitled to possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.988" offset="2077633">The statute goes on to provide that if the Court or Jury finds the complaint to be true, the tenants shall be evicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.482" offset="2115563">Thus, these statutes on their face preclude the raising of affirmative legal defenses and they have been so construed by the Oregon Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1073.301" offset="4366900">The landlord collects the entire amount of the bond, not just to the damages or expenses if any.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.056" offset="4397934">If the tenant loses at the Circuit Court, he may appeal to the State Supreme Court and the same process is again repeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.747" offset="4436699">We are challenging the three-major restrictions on the low-income tenant’s ability to properly defend himself in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.707" offset="4464494">These are; first, the short time to prepare for trial, (2) The refusal of the Court to hear his defenses and (3) the denial of his ability to appeal because of the double rent bond requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.269" offset="4522799">We contend that these restrictions violate both the equal protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment because they affect certain fundamental interests of the tenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.033" offset="4565849">The first of these fundamental interests is his right to retain peaceful possession of his home or the sanctity of the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.302" offset="4594897">Second, is his right to decent housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.148" offset="4606286">Third, his right to meaningful access to and equal treatment in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.681" offset="4628438">While all of these interests has been treated as fundamental by this Court in various decisions, the right to retain peaceful possession of once home has received the most attention, from the Court being protected under the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.192" offset="4686430">For example in Silverman versus United States at 365 U.S., this Court rejected evidence obtained by the use of spiked mike which intruded several inches under the wall of the defendant’s home as it would have obtained by “actual intrusion” into a constitutionally protected area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.865" offset="4765111">In Camara versus Municipal Court at 387 U.S., this Court held that a warrant must be obtained before homes can be inspected by City Agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.424" offset="4803354">And in Rowan versus United States Post Office Department, this Court upheld in the face of the First Amendment attack, a statute protecting householders from junk mail intrusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.383" offset="4847240">If this Court has found the sanctity of the home to be worthy of constitutional protection against these sporadic intrusions, how much more worthy a protection is the right to be free from a total ousting of possession?</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.043" offset="4901888">Total ousting by the County Sheriff is what faces the tenant who looses an eviction action in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.825" offset="4924980">It is almost inevitable under the procedures we are challenging.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.902" offset="4941281">In addition, certain of the restrictions, we are dealing with involve a suspect classification, one based upon wealth, since indigent tenants do not have the resources to post either the continuance bond or the double rent appeal bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.505" offset="5003661">We do not feel that we are asking for anything unreasonable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.802" offset="5020902">We fully recognize that there are certain interests of the landlord that the State of Oregon may reasonably protect, if it wishes to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.102" offset="5054130">The main interest meant to be protected by the restrictions we are challenging is the landlord's desire to see that he will not lose rent money, he may have come into it during the litigation, that he eventually might win.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.852" offset="5101046">Statutes designed to protect this interest should be constitutional if they are reasonable, but the restrictions involved here go too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.727" offset="5136572">They are unreasonable at the expense of the tenant’s interests in protecting his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.010" offset="5157679">We can understand, for example, shortening the time to prepare for trial on eviction action to something less than that available to other defendants.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore B. Jensen</label>
            <text syncTime="1617.463" offset="6543527">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.958" offset="6561499">I am appearing here for the defendant, Mrs. Normet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.118" offset="6606117">The factual situation in the case actually as we see it was that Mrs. Normet was the record owner of the property, but had become so with an outstanding contract of sale on the property to a party who had in turn rented the property to the Lindseys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.016" offset="6741744">When Mrs. Normet on default on this contract under which the property had been sold and more or less had been abandoned by the contract purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.903" offset="6793258">Mrs. Normet had begin to collect and she did receive the rent payments from the Lindseys up through November, applied them on the contract of sale and commenced a suit to foreclose the contract in order to clear up the title of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.898" offset="6897225">Then in November, the City of Portland, under its Housing Code, notified both the Lindseys, they being the tenants and Mrs. Normet that the property was substandard in a good many respects and posted a notice that the property be vacated or the repairs made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.141" offset="7006208">At that point Mrs. Normet through her attorney gave a notice to the Lindseys requesting them to vacate the property in accordance with order of the city of Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.965" offset="7069529">She not wanting to go ahead and spend the money which would be required to make the repairs because of the existing cloud on the title of the property at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.497" offset="7127625">Now, the Trial Court made a finding that there was a landlord-tenant relationship between Mrs. Normet and the Lindsey’s and treated it as though it were an ordinary landlord-tenant relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.365" offset="7211112">In this case, we view the summary of the argument and briefs of the appellant that they are saying on two grounds that the Oregon Eviction Statutes are unconstitutional because they do not grant equal protection and due process at law and that it deprived tenants of rights and privileges afforded to them in the civil eviction actions in Oregon by denying basic rights needed to enable them to receive fundamentally fair hearings on their defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.008" offset="7397731">Now, I would like first of all to direct my remarks to the Oregon Eviction Law briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.557" offset="7443916">First of all, the Oregon Eviction Law is only available or is only used when there exist a landlord-tenant relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.060" offset="7489891">It does not apply in any other situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.760" offset="7512670">It protects, our position is that it protects all tenants equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.678" offset="7544435">It does not make any distinction as to what their funds may be that they have available to them whether they are rich or poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.481" offset="7587589">It just applies and gives equal protection to all tenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.415" offset="7607338">If the tenants, first of all, we have no self-help procedure in Oregon that is where the landlord can go in and evict the tenant himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.653" offset="7668255">If he wants to evict a tenant from the property he has to go in to the Court and get a determination that he has the right to take possession from the tenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.465" offset="7719560">He can do this, if the tenant has failed to pay the rent within 10 days after due or if the tenant’s lease has expired and the tenant has refused to get out or if the tenant’s month-to-month or what tenancy or whatever the term is has been terminated upon either 30 days notice or if it is a longer tenancy where than on a notice equivalent to the term and then if a tenant refuses to vacate, the landlord must in order to have a determination then of his right to take possession, he must go in and file a complaint in court, setting forth, it is kind of a notice sort of a complaint, at least the equivalent of the Federal rules requirements, in which he in effect says that the tenant is withholding the premises unlawfully and with force and that the landlord is entitled to possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.229" offset="8022580">That is the only issue in the FED case at that point in the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="2082.657" offset="8404281">That is correct Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.148" offset="8430299">As a matter of practice, in most FED cases the simple landlord-tenant relationship of rental of a residence on a month-to-month basis file just for possession without joining any rent or any other cause of action with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.603" offset="8540118">Now, I think the Court should realize that the FED Eviction Laws of Oregon apply not only to the rental of residences, but it applies and is available and used in connection with commercial properties where there is a lease for example and the tenant has refused to vacate at the end of the lease with most leasers providing that if they hold over at the end of the term, then they are month-to-month tenants, then you will have to give a 30-day notice and bring your FED action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.600" offset="8700092">But you can see that in cases involving commercial property where the tenant may find a tremendous financial advantage to him to remain in a particular property for another year or so, it would be a unfair to permit him to stay in just by continuing to pay his rent if the landlord has given him the 30 days notice and his lease term is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.519" offset="8811792">Now, we have personal service in Oregon of the summons in complaint on the tenant and the summons provides that the matter will come before the Court and the return made from two to four days, the day of service is not counted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.992" offset="8905624">So, it comes up then before the Court at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.162" offset="8922342">There need not be any written answer filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.580" offset="8936030">We have procedure in the Oregon Law which grants to the defendant tenant two more days continuance for without any showing of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.029" offset="8997784">He can have an additional two days continuance and then if that is not a sufficient amount and he wishes to have a further continuance that can be obtained by posting security for the payment of his rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.505" offset="9071658">That may -- to cover the period of the time for the continuance that he wants, in other words, the practical aspect of that is that he does not have to go back and pay his delinquent rent, that is not an issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.474" offset="9143547">It is possession and if he wants to remain in possession and get a continuance of the case for more time for preparation or for whatever the reason may be, he can do so from a practical aspect by paying the month’s rent and that would give him a 30-day extension of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2646.068" offset="10657917">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.340" offset="10679024">The Oregon Eviction procedure does not deprive either the tenant or the landlord of the right to assert other claims they may have under the General Court Procedure which is available to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.449" offset="10751436">In other words, they have open to them the General Court procedure for litigating any other claims that they may have against each other arising out of the rent agreement or the rent contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.053" offset="10821862">Now, the appellants seem to argue here that all defendants should be treated equally and that it is wrong to have a separate eviction procedure to determine possession of rented property between the landlord and tenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.862" offset="10889153">In support of that, they compare a mortgage foreclosure case with an FED case under the Oregon Law and then say that since the procedure is different that the tenant defendants in a FED case do not receive equal protection or the same protection as an owner of real property whose mortgages being foreclosed and claim that therefore the eviction or FED procedure is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.965" offset="11029588">Certainly there is a vast difference between the owner of real property who is delinquent in the payment of a mortgage and a tenant who does not pay his rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.939" offset="11089460">It seems to me, that we certainly would not require a landlord, first to obtain a judgment for the rent and then hold some sort of a judicial sale to evict the tenant, terminating his right to possession of the property perhaps even with some redemption rights following the order have some sort of a strict foreclosure proceeding which would grant the tenant some period of time to pay up his delinquency before the landlord could retake possession of his property from a defaulting tenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.489" offset="11243583">I submit that the summary eviction procedures justify because of the intending rights existing in a landlord-tenant relationship and the Oregon Eviction Law grants equal protection to all landlord and tenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.549" offset="11319860">The State of Oregon has the right to establish by legislative enactment a summary procedure to determine the issue of possession between landlords and tenants and that is what it has done with its statute and laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.918" offset="11397392">Now, I would like to make a comment or two with regard to the amicus curiae briefs that were filed in this case primarily to make the point that the Oregon Eviction Laws do provide due process to tenants in compliance with the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.085" offset="11514002">First of all, we have no self-help provision in Oregon for the landlord as there are in Arkansas and Arizona under their unlawful detainer statutes which require some sort of a bond from the tenant to keep possession prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.770" offset="11596758">Before the landlord in Oregon can take any steps towards recovering possession he has to file and commence a case in Court under the eviction statute, filing a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.843" offset="11665095">We do not have what is called conspicuous service or so-called sewer service in Oregon as they apparently have in New York and Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.331" offset="11698949">Oregon requires personal service or the same service as in any other litigation in the Oregon Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.249" offset="11738655">We do not permit an oral complaint as in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.037" offset="11753806">Oregon requires a written complaint filed in a summons issue and we permit continuances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.353" offset="11791109">We do not refuse to grant a continuance as in New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.178" offset="11814410">Oregon grants a two-day continuance without any cause on request and an unlimited continuance if security posted for the rent which may be found due during the continuance period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.772" offset="11872716">In other words, you can pay rent, pay your current rent and get a 30-day continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.088" offset="11906048">In Kentucky, it permits, in amicus curiae brief, there is a statement that there is the trial as before the Court not presided over by judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.118" offset="11946172">Oregon Courts are all presided over by legally trained judges and jury trial on request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.352" offset="11991103">Oregon does not allow in the FED eviction, the landlord to recover both possessions and judgment of money damages as in the California and New Hampshire States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.695" offset="12048468">In Oregon, if you join the rent claim or any other claim that you have then you have to make the usual service as you would in other cases and it proceeds accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.659" offset="12120357">Oregon in some states in referring primarily to California observed from the amicus curiae brief that they allow the FED, the eviction procedure to be used by the purchaser at an execution mortgage foreclosure to recover possession, I suppose after the sale of the property at sheriff sale, if the former owner does not voluntarily surrender possession of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.649" offset="12240311">And they also allow it to be used to recover possession under and after a trustee's sale under a trustee’s deed to evict the former owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.664" offset="12284301">Oregon has no such statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.787" offset="12292869">Our eviction statute is related and confined entirely to the landlord-tenant relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="3643.946" offset="14649428">They may need witnesses to testify as to whether or not rent is in fact been paid or whether rent receipts are available and in connection with that, the attorney still has to ascertain whether or not there is in fact a valid defense and he needs more time in order to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.861" offset="14721108">The third point is regarding the joining of the action for rent and FED under -- in our brief at page 48 footnote 13, we have cited two statutory provisions which provide that the action for rent can be joined with an FED, but at that point the case is severed and the action for rent proceeds as any other lawsuit with the FED proceeding close forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.811" offset="14820895">The fourth point is the -- I would refer the Court to plaintiff’s exhibit number 14 which is the letter sent to the Lindseys by the Normet’s attorney.</text>
