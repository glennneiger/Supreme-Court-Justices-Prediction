            <text syncTime="132.224" offset="602548">Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan that is, if in fact the first question were decided against the petitioner, we submit and our contention is that the two are interrelated that if in fact this Court were to sustain a standard less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt for a trial judge making such a finding, it should constitutionally require that at the very least the jury get a second look at that issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.611" offset="920092">What the state is arguing is that once admitted a confession may only be considered in the context of all the evidence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.700" offset="960425">Our contention is that if a confession is admitted must still be singled out to the jury and it must then be asked to decide the question of voluntariness vel non as a preliminary fact finding.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="413.474" offset="1727589">Well, Mr. Justice White, the petitioner’s position in this case is that the Court need not go -- need not reach if it decides not to the question whether the judge must necessarily find the confession voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.288" offset="1802822">It would be sufficient if someone in the process found it voluntary beyond reasonable doubt and the vice of the Illinois procedure is that there is no one in entire process whoever passed it on voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.155" offset="1862277">Essentially the State’s argument is that a confession is like any other evidence -- the finding of voluntariness vel non is to a confession is like a preliminary fact finding as to whether a statement is for example spontaneous utterance so to be an exemption of the hearsay rule or whether a certain document is the best evidence under the best evidence rule and that therefore the judge and judge alone may make that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.770" offset="1976798">He makes the finding on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence and he then submits that evidence to the jury for it to be considered along with all other evidence in the case, instructing them only as the Winship case now requires that they must find the defending guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on all the evidence in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.897" offset="2061225">Petitioner’s contention is of course that that analogy of confession to any other evidence is plainly unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.333" offset="2103021">The fact that this Court even discussed the question much less that it decided as it did in Jackson v. Denno is a plain indication that the question of voluntariness of a confession because it involves a possible infringement upon Fifth Amendment rights, various constitutional dangers working in the background requires special procedural handling as a constitutional matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.478" offset="2227573">Surely it would not have presented a constitutional issue and this Court would not have considered it if a state say New York simply said, well at the spontaneous declarations, we do not allow a judge to make that preliminary finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.914" offset="2285356">We just have the jury make the preliminary factual finding, or as to any other exemption of the hearsay rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.142" offset="2326212">If a state had done so that would present no constitutional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.513" offset="2343766">Since New York did so with regard to confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.249" offset="2354633">It did present the problem considered by this Court in Jackson and the ruling of this Court in Jackson that there must be a reliable clear cut finding on the issue of voluntariness vel no.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.090" offset="2422029">Now, we submit that it follows from the Jackson decision as well as subsequent decisions in related areas by this Court that there must be a finding on the issue of voluntariness at a trial that a confession is voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.050" offset="2525892">Now, of course the broadest range of that argument is to say that the judge must make that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.990" offset="2553581">When he makes that initial determination required under Jackson v. Denno, he must make it beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.207" offset="2586496">That issue need not, we submit, be reached in this case because in this case and under the Illinois procedure there is no one, no one in the entire process against the defendant whoever makes that finding beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.992" offset="2657653">Consequently, we think that the Illinois practice is invalid even under the opinion of the Chief Justice as Circuit Judge in the DC Court of Appeals, which are cited, the opinions of which are cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.029" offset="2729751">In the Clifton case, the Chief Justice as a Circuit Judge did say and we reprinted that as an appendix to our brief, it appears on page 6 (d) that it is one thing to call for the high standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt from the ultimate fact finders and quite another to ask that the issue be resolved preliminarily by the judge beyond a reasonable doubt contrary to all the law governing admissibility of evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2253.428" offset="9087433">That is the standard Illinois practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.298" offset="9106868">The petitioner in attacking that practice takes basically two separate positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.085" offset="9138006">His first is that in any case where the constitutional acquisition or constitutional legality of the acquisition of evidence is a question, it is the burden of the prosecution to prove that it constitutionally acquired the evidence and it is the burden that they must sustain by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.972" offset="9221598">Now, I would point out and it is been alluded to that there a considerable amount of precedent generally against that rule on search and seizure cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.867" offset="9269141">The Federal rule does not place the burden on the prosecution in cases where there is a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.927" offset="9289412">There are many states that place the burden on the defense, in all cases where illegality of search and seizures challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.904" offset="9317310">That is true in Illinois incidentally by statute, a statute that immediately follows the one on confessions deals with motion to suppress evidence illegally seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.475" offset="9363599">I might also point out that in the few cases in which this Court has spoken on the subject of burden and those have been Bumper versus North Carolina on the burden of proof to establish consent search; and Miranda versus Arizona on the burden of proof to establish waiver; and in United States versus Wade on the burden of proof to establish an independent basis of identification when there is a primary legality, in none of those cases has this Court adopted a reasonable doubt standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.351" offset="9503093">The standard is simply burden of proof in consent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.979" offset="9517617">In Miranda, the language was heavy burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.960" offset="9529529">In United States versus Wade, the language was clear on convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.205" offset="9554502">Essentially its petitioner’s first point that the constitutional nature of the constitutional issues involved make these questions as special.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.346" offset="9607061">I would point out that only if you take a very limited tactical view of the criminal trial, they are made particularly special.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.665" offset="9648334">Questions of the admissibility of hearsay are usually of extreme importance in criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.251" offset="9678636">I point out that, for example, it s not the burden of the prosecution to prove that conspiracy exists and to prove it exists beyond a reasonable doubt before the declaration of the co-conspirator can be admitted into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.851" offset="9737046">And the question of accomplices which is a vital question in most criminal trials where there is accomplice evidence, it is the burden of the defendant to prove witness is an accomplice and that is particularly vital burden since that very often is the difference between a directed verdict of acquittal and a conviction on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.841" offset="9825026">Furthermore, I think that there is a confusion and it runs through all of the arguments of the petitioner, between the purpose served as a reasonable doubt rule and the purpose served by the exclusionary rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.102" offset="9874032">It is clear to me at least that the purposes of the exclusionary rule are in entirely separate and apart from the determination of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.398" offset="9919276">Indeed with some of the exclusionary rules, mostly search and seizure, their existence cannot be squared with policies promoting the accuracy of fact-finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.511" offset="9983746">Furthermore, the reasonable doubt rule, in all of its manifestations, every single one is a rule that is concerned solely with the weight of the evidence in a criminal trial and not with the admissibility of evidence and Chapman upon which petitioner relies very heavily does not change this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.585" offset="10063994">First of all Chapman is a case that applies only when the existence of a constitutional error has been established and it says nothing about the burden of proof to establish the existence of that error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.401" offset="10115299">Second of all, Chapman is essentially an application of a reasonable doubt standard in a case where you are dealing, although it is an Appellate Court that deals with the question, with questions of weight of the evidence because in a harmless error context and what the Court is concerned with is a relative weight of this bad evidence or tainted evidence in a context to the whole evidence to determine whether it harmed the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.649" offset="10224282">It is essentially a question again of weight of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.656" offset="10244344">There is no precedent and I submit no policy consistent with the existing reasonable doubt rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2945.317" offset="11854949">The Court specifically rejected the suggestion that a difference could be made between confessions and other forms of evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3132.955" offset="12605500">And I would generally read the opinions first in the Law Review article.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.062" offset="12633921">The third point made by, is a relatively minor one, third point made by a petitioner I think I ought to touch on it is that the defendant in this case is in a much worse position than Jackson was in the Jackson versus Denno.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.245" offset="12714692">I have a two essential problems with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.535" offset="12723782">The first is that I think that is a terrible constitutional standard that tactical position determines whether a rule is constitutionally required and to put it another way I think that a petitioner would have to contend that Jackson and Denno decided that whatever makes it more difficult for the prosecution to put -- present a confession is a constitutionally required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.919" offset="12833392">My second difficulty is that he -- the petitioner here is not worse position than Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.279" offset="12862754">Plain truth of the matter is accepting a premise of the Jackson opinion, the petitioner in Jackson never had a hearing, an adequate hearing on voluntariness and the petitioner here did have such a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.490" offset="12911655">The other point in this regard made by the petitioner is that if the judge makes a determination that a confession is voluntary by preponderance of the evidence then when it comes to the time of trial, the confession is introduced and the petitioner has to determine whether to get up on the stand and suffer all of the risks connected with his appearance on the stand and he must do this without a proof of voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.729" offset="13048641">I think that argument cannot be sustained in light of McGautha versus California nor can it be sustained in light of the guilty plea cases, the trilogy of cases beginning with McMinn versus Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.274" offset="13106737">And in fact the decision whether to testify is made by a defendant without any determination in most cases of important issues beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.388" offset="13155221">The defendant in effect can take a prosecution case which is barely able to survive a motion for directed verdict, testify in the stand and sink himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.961" offset="13201509">And in that position, far worse one than the petitioner faced in this case, that he has no right to determination that the prosecution's proof establishes his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.957" offset="13253545">The final point made by petitioner is that he ought to have been given a jury trial in effect on the issue of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.100" offset="13290117">I would point out that it seems to me that the essence of Jackson v. Denno was that the jury does not really, in fact, is constitutionally incapable of giving a hearing on the issue of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.097" offset="13354065">That the jury just will not separate the issue, that jury will consider weight probable truth and falsity and will determine voluntariness in the pure classic sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.932" offset="13405369">I point out also that the jury determination of issues of admissibility is not a traditional function of the jury and that would not be binding upon a states under Duncan versus Louisiana and at least in the few precedents that have dealt with the issue seems to be really contended that there is a constitutional requirement of the existing precedent such as that it is against that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.705" offset="13524487">Frankly, the only way to satisfy petitioner’s claim in this regard would be to impanel separate jury on the motion to suppress because it would be only then purely apart from the issue of guilt or innocence that jury could give a determination of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.763" offset="13600765">It is our opinion and our contention that a jury ought not be constitutional required to decide a question that this Court recognized that it is incapable to decide.</text>
