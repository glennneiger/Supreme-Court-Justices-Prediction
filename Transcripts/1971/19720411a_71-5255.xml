            <text syncTime="65.593" offset="335995">The petitioner Willie Mae Barker was indicted in September of 1958 for the murder of Orlena Denton, a vicious heinous crime which he was accused of bursting into her bedroom and beat her to death with a tire iron with an accomplice one Silas Manning who becomes very relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.943" offset="417497">His case was originally set for trial in October of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.813" offset="436933">However, there occurred a series of 16 continuances granted the prosecution in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.777" offset="464831">Willie Mae Barker was not brought to trial until October of 1963, a delay in excess of five years.</text>

            <text syncTime="177.521" offset="783734">The Kentucky Court of Appeals and both in the Sixth Circuit held it was 1963 that this motion was made February 12, 1963 but the -- and where they found this date I have no knowledge, the record clearly shows it was made on February 12, 1962.</text>

            <label>Mr. James E. Milliman</label>
            <text syncTime="200.830" offset="877044">Yes Your Honor but the District Court, it's ironic to District Court on page 22 of the appendix pointed out that the motion was made in February 26, 1962 then talked about the resulting eight months delay but the delay was a resulting 19 months delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.642" offset="944230">So there is confusion as to this date.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.674" offset="956351">The petitioner was released on $5,000.00 bond in June of 1959 and remained free on $5,000.00 bond until he was finally convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.766" offset="1004730">Petitioner then appealed to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky alleging he was denied as right to a speedy trial and other errors in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.296" offset="1042869">The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction then later petitioner filed this habeas corpus proceeding in the District Court, the Western District of Kentucky which denied relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.778" offset="1088740">He appealed to this United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which affirmed the District Court decision and this Court granted certiorari January 18th of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.656" offset="1136283">The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit decided this case on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.949" offset="1157494">They held that petitioner had waived his right to a speedy trial by failing to demand trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.496" offset="1183617">That the demand rule states that the right to a speedy trial is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment is a personal right which may be weighed.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.408" offset="1219352">So the Sixth Circuit computed only the time after the first motion to dismiss was made in computing the length of the delay which had found to be nine months using the 1963 date.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.145" offset="1266268">It also held that petitioner had not shown that he was prejudice by the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.996" offset="1293644">Petitioner's therefore raised two points on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.903" offset="1309318">First that the demand rule is inconsistent with constitutional safeguards and should not be required and the second issue is where there is a five year delay, prejudice should be presumed as inherent in the delay and it's important to emphasize in this case the two amicus briefs have been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.936" offset="1401373">We are concerned in this case with a five-year delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.351" offset="1419032">We are not concerned with a one year delay or two-year delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.582" offset="1435959">This case presents a five-year delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.571" offset="1451946">The demand rule is applied in this case, is subject to attack on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.645" offset="1480263">This Court has consistently held that any waiver of a constitutional right must be voluntary and intelligent knowing and that it will not accept a passive waiver --</text>

            <text syncTime="379.712" offset="1592485">Your Honor in the present case, it is contended that the demand rule as such chills his right to a speedy trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="395.065" offset="1653925">This put him in the position of -- if he has to demand trial to protect his right to a speedy trial, he has possibly asking himself, asking the prosecution to give him the electric chair.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.899" offset="1713275">The result if he is successful is death, this is a grisly choice which this Court condemned in Faye versus Noia, where --</text>

            <text syncTime="1619.006" offset="6549690">The Commonwealth did delay the trial of the petitioner for five years and I think a little more thorough explanation of why it delayed it as an order, the Commonwealth shows to prosecute Silas Manning first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.331" offset="6623042">Now this decision I don't know why it was made but the Commonwealth Attorney did make it and they had not by my brother he -- they did have a difficulty in obtaining a valid conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.384" offset="6687199">I don't think it can be blamed on any incompetence on the part of the Commonwealth Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.624" offset="6716142">And after in December of 1962 when Manning's final trial was held, trial was set for the next term to Court to February term of the 1963 Christian County Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.315" offset="6770895">The chief collaborating witness was the sheriff of Christian County, Sheriff McKinney.</text>

            <text syncTime="1720.382" offset="6955215">And the Commonwealth submits that the real issue in this case is not when the demand should be made or if a demand should be made but narrowest down to the fact made the Commonwealth delay a trial for any reason for this period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.111" offset="7034105">Now, there are several statutes from different states which call for a dismissal of the indictment similar to Federal Rule 48 (b) if a trial was not held within so many days or so many months or so many terms at Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.102" offset="7102128">But every -- every rule or every statute also states in the final line unless good cause be shown and our contention is that the Commonwealth had good cause in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2726.961" offset="10981520">Yes Your Honor, I would like to express my opinion on the reason for delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.061" offset="11005866">The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals do not specifically decide this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.943" offset="11025406">They decided simply that from the period of the time of the demand which they found to be February 12, 1963 to the time of trial but there was a sufficient reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.584" offset="11063963">We do not specifically urge this point on our petition for certiorari for the simple reasons of the Court of Appeals do not really decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.743" offset="11104609">And that this Court could conceivably, if they wish remand to the Sixth Circuit of Appeals for further findings on that issue if they would strike that down the demand rule and hold the petitioner has shown or is not required to show prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.794" offset="11168870">It could remand to the Sixth Circuit for further findings as to the reason for delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.808" offset="11192903">As his Honor, I believe, Justice Blackmun referred to the U.S. versus Marion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.947" offset="11213488">We would like to accept the good and reject the bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.118" offset="11230102">The Marion case is not applicable to this case for the simple reason that in that case this Court held that the defendants were not an accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.257" offset="11274719">Because they were talking about a pre-indictment delay and that the Sixth Amendment applies only to an accused and one does not become accused until he is indicted and there is still no question in this case that Willie Mae Barker fit the definition of an accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.686" offset="11344413">The Marion case would be applicable and that it explained that the statute of limitations for example are designed to guarantee against stale claims and of course in Kentucky and most states, there is no statute limitations for murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.184" offset="11414422">So there is no statute of limitations to apply in this case and it did point out again that reaffirmed the -- this Court's position of the prejudice resulting from the pretrial delays, the anxiety, the hostility and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.420" offset="11475339">So in that respect, it is most applicable to this case.</text>
