            <text syncTime="340.862" offset="1437134">There was no mention of this report.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.718" offset="1448523">There were no witnesses, no examination, no finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.717" offset="1460540">The doctor did not appear in Court, so far as we can tell.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.157" offset="1494290">The Court simply signed a formal order reciting that there was reasonable cause to believe that Mr. McNeil maybe a defective delinquent and he was sent to Patuxent.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.623" offset="1540161">Now, at Patuxent as you know from the Murel argument a week or so ago, when you arrive you are placed on a receiving tier and as the Court also knows, this is a very vital and important part of the structure at Patuxent.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.141" offset="1606303">It is a way -- the tier system is way of advancing out of Patuxent.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.227" offset="1622603">You go to from one tier to the next, depending upon the extent that which you cooperate, and you progress and you show that you are no longer threat to society and so forth, then after you get beyond the forth tier you move out.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.212" offset="1674535">Difficulty is that that there is no way of getting out of the receiving tier and tell there is a report on you and in this case they have never issued a report on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.729" offset="1716644">The people on the receiving tier cannot advance, they cannot receive therapy.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.008" offset="1733780">In effect they are in limbo with little, but limited exercise and television while they are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.715" offset="1756559">Mr. McNeil has been on the receiving tier for almost six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.682" offset="1780383">During this period on at least 15 different occasions, the state says 18, but I think it is irrelevant, he has refused to submit to interrogation by by staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.210" offset="1826567">Patuxent apparently thinks that this is essential to its evaluation.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.233" offset="1842659">He has refused to submit on Fifth ground and so he has remained there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1330.994" offset="5397715">The only way he can get out of the receiving tier and get a report is by saying yes, I stolen the cookies in high school and I might say parenthetically it is rather odd, but in Maryland there is no statute of limitations at all on any crime for which you can be sentenced to prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.695" offset="5472530">They can go back when the man is 80-years old and convict him for something he did when he was 25.</text>

            <text syncTime="1564.070" offset="6329973">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.719" offset="6344602">The full text of the statute, Article 31 (b) is set out in the Murel brief of the state and it is not been reprinted in these briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.019" offset="6381800">Only those excerpts which are directly bearing on the outcome of disposition of the particular arguments made by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.392" offset="6423282">Now, before I get to the question of whether or not there is a privilege against self incrimination which I think is a pivotable point in this argument of the petitioner, I would like to emphasize that the transfer in July of 1966 or August of 1966 of the petitioner to Patuxent was a valid transfer under any fair reading of the cases of this Court or the cases of the circuit courts and appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.642" offset="6552223">Now Mr. McNeil was convicted of committing two crimes, either one of which is a threshold crime under Section 6 (a) of the defective delinquency statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.629" offset="6604259">One was assault upon a police officer which under Section 6 (a) is a crime of violence, a threshold crime triggering the operation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.090" offset="6646055">The second crime was attempted rape under Section 6 (a) (4) a sex crime involving physical force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.801" offset="6680954">Now, there was a conviction on both charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.133" offset="6706241">The sentence, it is true was five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.695" offset="6720451">The sentence of course was discretionary with the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.166" offset="6734349">The case was heard now-jury and upon a point that I hope to return to later in an argument, the sentence clearly could have been at least 25 years if the maximum had been imposed and if the sentences had been in the two indictments to run consecutively rather than concurrently.</text>

            <text syncTime="2470.263" offset="9954724">Now, the most obvious one is that at that point in time when a man's sentence is about to expire or at that point in time at the end of six months when a report because of non-cooperation has been impossible, the petitioner is brought back before the court and bear in mind that the order transferring him runs to the institution, he is put under a specific order directly in court to cooperate with the diagnostic procedures at Patuxent institution and his failure subsequently to so cooperate would bring about convictions of contempt to court, probably direct criminal contempt to court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3472.815" offset="13964938">Please the Court, in view of the concessions made by the state let me just make one last point in regard to the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.691" offset="13988448">The reason I indicated that I think the man ought to be ordered immediately released as opposed to just having a hearing at this point is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.284" offset="14018855">In view of the fact that the state has said in their brief that they cannot find him to be a defective delinquent based on this record, in view with the fact that I as his attorney I am not about to telling him that he should incriminate himself based on the state's assurance to this Court that they do not plan to convict him on the basis of what he is going to say, a hearing would be a wasted gesture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.293" offset="14098894">He has now serve his full criminal term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.666" offset="14108402">I can read you from cases where things that these fellows have said in the course these interviews have then been used in court to keep them in Patuxent indefinitely and moreover we have no idea how in view with fact that what he says goes right into his file which is open to the prosecutor, the information that he gives could not be used as a link to chain to prosecute him later.</text>

            <text syncTime="3535.305" offset="14214878">I take it you say that this information since it would be used in connects with deciding whether he is a defective delinquent which might result in extending his terms, is it so incriminating?</text>

            <text syncTime="3550.368" offset="14275168">While his original sentence was still open they could use it to re-convict him that is no longer true here, but that is in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.207" offset="14302544">Number two, they could convict him now and at any time for anything that he confessed to in the course of this interrogation in which they would get evidence out of this file and number three, without any question they would use it to keep him in Patuxent indefinitely because just to read you in the Daniel’s case a very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.650" offset="14392301">This is man convicted of house breaking and Larceny and when they tried to keep him in they give evidence of sexual behavior of the inmate used and the court said that was alright, they could used that as evidence to keep him indefinitely with Patuxent without any relationship to his original crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.900" offset="14453323">Of course they are going to use it in that is file would never tell this man to talk and why therefore I think a hearing of this stage is a wasted gesture, why his entitled to immediate release.</text>
