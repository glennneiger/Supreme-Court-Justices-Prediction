            <text syncTime="16.120" offset="138214">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.709" offset="152529">The question before this Court this afternoon is relatively easy to state, simply it is a combination claim of the United States patent, infringed by one who manufactures and sells the separate parts in the United States, when all assembly end use takes place in a foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.053" offset="245943">I suppose even more simply the question could be stated, does a combination claim of the United States patent, reach separate, unassembled parts or is it limited to the combination, the assembled combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.236" offset="306652">It is petitioner's view here that there is no infringement on the facts of this case, that a combination claim reaches only the assembled combination and that it does not reach the separate parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.707" offset="364539">As far as our considerations here are concerned, the ship which took Deepsouth's parts from the peer in and New Orleans might as well have sunk five miles offshore, the question is whether or not a combination claim means what this Court consistently has held it means and what the statute says it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.249" offset="454714">Now, perhaps prior to getting into the facts, that is the claim, it would be well for the Court to review or for me to review for the Court briefly what got us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.334" offset="515004">This case began as an infringement case in the District Court in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.726" offset="536634">The respondent, Laitram Corporation brought suit against petitioner Deepsouth, for infringement of two patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.862" offset="569130">Now one of those patents we call the slitter patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.300" offset="582923">Its number is 2694218; the other is called the Tumbler or Deveiner patent and its number is 2825927.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.769" offset="632764">I would like to invite the Court's attention if I may, to the large buff colored Appendix and more particularly to Page 114.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.257" offset="854701">Now, if you will then turn to Page 443 of the Index, which is in the supplement, you will find a picture of Laitram's commercial device, which shows a plurality of blades on the trough.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.679" offset="912379">The only other difference being that the water sprays are omitted in the commercial device, omitted because they didn't work to devein.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.862" offset="957101">Now if Your Honors, then we will turn to the large Appendix book to Page 120, you will see figure 1 of the patent there which discloses the commercial embodiment of the Laitram Deveiner, which is a drum, a cylindrical drum to which the slit shrimp are fed and as they go through the drum with a residence time of between one and two minutes, the veins which have been exposed by the slitting procedure with the previous apparatus are either pulled out if they are hanging free or dug out if they are not.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.895" offset="1373284">The court has said that when you are looking to the issue of infringement, you therefore look very carefully at the elements whether or not they are new and whether or not there is a co-action, the synergism which the opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas in Anderson's Black Rock pointed out so clearly.</text>

            <text syncTime="370.360" offset="1555096">And since it is very short, I would like to examine with you the three elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.838" offset="1577039">An inclined trough down which shrimp are induced to slide, secondly a knife in said trough positioned to be encountered by shrimp to cut the membrane confining the vein, and third a water spray to the trough directed upon the shrimp for sliding them down to the trough and flushing out the vein, as indicated the flushing didn't occur and that necessitated the second patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.243" offset="1686648">If Your Honors will then look at Page 9 of the Blue brief you will see the three element combination claim which is involved in the second or 927 patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.210" offset="1730534">Very briefly one, a support member, two a lip protruding at an acute angle from the support member, and then three means operatively associated with the support for relatively moving the shrimp with respect to said member to cause separation of the vein.</text>

            <text syncTime="464.255" offset="1930737">I am assuming that they are not and they are all old here, but going from this question to the law, I think whatever the combination is, the decisions of this court foreclose in our view, an affirmance of the court below and so does 35 U.S. Code 271 Subsections (a) and (c).</text>

            <text syncTime="514.534" offset="2131880">If that is so and the bolt is resided as an element our law says, that that would not result in an infringement.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold J. Birch</label>
            <text syncTime="528.849" offset="2189140">That is the law of this Court as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.500" offset="2199693">And the Aro case clearly says that the law of this court has been carried forward without change in Section 271 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="539.868" offset="2233130">Of course, here we don't simply have one bolt or one screw, what we have are the three elements in each of the combinations and no one of those elements with the exception of the fingernail belt in the deveiner patent; ever were joined to the other, they were separately manufactured, separately shipped and never joined together in the United States or United States patents are affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.017" offset="2333754">Now, going to 271 (a) the Congress has made it abundantly clear that direct infringement which again this court has held 271 (a) embodies the law of this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.727" offset="2396552">Says, that whoever without authority makes uses or sells any patented invention within the United States infringes the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.633" offset="2444200">What that provision is clearly telling us is not that someone who makes a machine or sells a machine shall be an infringer.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.574" offset="2480040">It says whoever shall make use or sell any patented invention, and I underscore that, shall infringe the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.621" offset="2520164">When we get down to Subsection (c), we there have the provision which Congress enacted specifically to take care of the person who made the parts, but did not directly infringe by assembling the combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.504" offset="2579723">And as this court knows, C resulted from an effort by Congress to resuscitate in part, the contributory infringement doctrine, which I think was given the (Inaudible) by this court in the Mercoid decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.504" offset="2643671">Now, turning to the decisions of this court, which are very pertinent and many of them squarely in the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.794" offset="2672823">In point not to the foreign shipment, but in point to the question of what infringes a combination claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.907" offset="2701349">I would like the Court just to consider with me briefly a few of them which are very germane.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.226" offset="2730606">The first of those starting out early indeed in 1840, was the Prouty v. Ruggles decision, where the same three elements we are dealing with here, that is the three element combination claim was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.039" offset="2793822">There, this court held that the union of all the parts arranged and combined together in the manner described, is the thing patented.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.895" offset="2845231">In other words, in the words of the section 271 (a), the patented invention is the parts combined together is the thing patented, and that case appears on 19 of our main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.604" offset="2904059">Then some years later, this Court in the leads cases which have been very widely, widely cited and which relate to a phonograph, and a record in combination held with respect to the parts that no one part of a resided combination is the combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.524" offset="2987755">Indeed says this court, all of the elements are not, they must be united by the same operation of law, that same decision repeated in the companion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.643" offset="3040314">I would like the Court at this point to consider two cases which appear later in our blue brief at Pages 33 and 34, which I suggest are squarely in point and controlling with respect to the law of this Court on the infringement of combination claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.019" offset="3109800">The first of those decisions both being written by Mr. Justice Hughes is the case of Woodward v. Hurd, the second Seim v. Hurd, both decided in 1914.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.592" offset="3168105">Now these two cases present the classic situations, as decided in the decisions of this Court with respect to what constitutes direct and what constitutes contributory infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.233" offset="3226619">Here the patented device was again a three element combination, a rim, a wheel, a rim of the wheel, a tyre and wires which tighten the rubber tyre in the rim.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.793" offset="3276879">The two cases were brought, one against the man who sold all the parts, and the other against the man who bought the parts and assembled them for the first time and Woodward --</text>

            <text syncTime="1283.468" offset="5207537">You have a right to operate outside the scope of claims and that's all that petitioner and people in the same position here did.</text>

            <text syncTime="1311.533" offset="5319863">And notice that in the three conflicting cases, in the Second, Third and the Seventh Circuits all sorts of devices are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.404" offset="5351315">In Andrea where the decision was against that of the Fifth Circuit, a radio was involved and it was a question of of whether the tools could or could not be put in with or without infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.596" offset="5396036">In the Cold Metal case there was a three-element combination again of rolls, journals and bearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.316" offset="5422995">Then in the Hewitt-Robins case in 1965 and 1966 in the Seventh Circuit, there was a huge machine involved which were shipped in parts, a bridge, a reclaimer wheel and supporting structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.109" offset="5482136">But the small man has every bit as big an opportunity to send his equipment overseas unassembled as the large one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.259" offset="5526753">Then the point is raised that unless the court below is affirmed, there will be a multiplicity of lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.993" offset="5557682">That one escapes me completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.521" offset="5567817">As of the law now, with the three conflicting decisions squarely in point and the law of this Court stating that there is no infringement of a combination claim without assembling, there is no action that can be properly brought against the person who sells only the parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.606" offset="5640124">If the Fifth Circuit is affirmed on the other hand, you not only have direct infringement against the manufacturer of the parts, you have direct infringement against a factor who goes out as the man in Woodward v. Hurd did and buys all the parts, collects them together and resells them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.633" offset="5708252">And then you will have an action for contributory infringement against every vendor who supplies a part that isn't a stable article of commerce if that part is especially adapted to go into the combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.435" offset="5759452">So as far as litigation is concerned, I think you are opening Pandora's box.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.811" offset="5780977">There will be a great multiplicity of lawsuits resulting from an affirmance of the court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="1969.497" offset="7951648">If the elements are old or new, as a matter of fact, you got to describe some sort of relationship at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.345" offset="7975053">The word old elements is almost not relevant to this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.064" offset="7997937">Let me go to something that Mr. Justice Blackmun said when he inquired about foreign patents which is quite relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.999" offset="8025731">There are an excess of 100 jurisdictions in the world that have foreign patents and when a man has an idea that he thinks is commercially valuable, a clock starts running against them and that clock starts at different times in different parts of the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.912" offset="8093336">For example, in the United States, he puts his device on sale, he has one year to file.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.687" offset="8120399">Somewhere, in some other country in world, the minute he has to file before he tries to market his device.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.691" offset="8156448">So in the United States, he files his application in the United States and he put his device on the market before them, he is precluded from getting a patent in the foreign country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.406" offset="8207334">I also might say that the litigation result was not commenced by the respondent, it was commenced by the customer petitioner and the extent of it has been the filling of a complaint and there was no summons ever served, the case as far as I know is completely defunct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2054.455" offset="8291553">No, back to Andrea, in Andrea 2, in Andrea 1, a statement was made, “No wrong was done the patentee until the combination is formed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.454" offset="8351530">What that clerk was saying is that the patentee did not have a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.663" offset="8372324">They were stating a result and the sentence before that, that says, nor is this so highly technical as it might seem, seems to vindicate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.163" offset="8422374">A small amount of defensiveness on the part of the Court in handling that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.761" offset="8440764">They come back to Andrea 2, they put the tubes in the radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.557" offset="8463961">They pull them apart and the Court says, it doesn't matter whether the parts are disconnected at the time of sale and Judge Swan says, aha, we have overruled Andrea 1 because we don't have to have final assembly at the time of sale, and I submit that Judge Swan viewed Andrea 2 correctly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.507" offset="8551733">So what is before this Court is Andrea 2 and the case below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.081" offset="8582035">Let's go to the perhaps most difficult case, the Hewitt-Robins case, the last case that considered this question, the ore reclaimer, the patent on the ore reclaimer issues in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.347" offset="8651102">I go to the Patent Office, I see the patent, it's an enormous device.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.858" offset="8673150">If I go to a manufacturer, we copy the exact pictures in the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.087" offset="8698018">It's a huge thing, we sell it to the man in Turkey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.445" offset="8715468">We never put the things together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.862" offset="8721111">We just copy the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.035" offset="8729783">That's the result of Hewitt-Robins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.742" offset="8740650">The result is that any large device, or any device at all, large or small, can be copied exactly so long as there isn't some sort of an evanescent mechanical connection or electrical connection within the confines of United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2182.802" offset="8804911">Well it's like the (Inaudible), if we come over here and copy, go back and make it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2186.457" offset="8819540">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.058" offset="8825914">It's perfectly infringing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.870" offset="8833124">I think in Hewitt-Robins however there were two or three points involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.494" offset="8847648">One of them was domestic, it's probably not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.089" offset="8866038">Now as to the economic run, Section 284 of the Patent Act provides for monetary recovery when someone infringes your patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.522" offset="8907729">Section 284 talks in terms of use of the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.769" offset="8928732">In this case, use of the patented invention, and this use can encompass any one of the three acts of making, using, or selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.262" offset="8974707">So the patentee is entitled to a monetary recovery regardless of whether the man has made, used, or sold the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.168" offset="9010338">Those acts are mutually exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.180" offset="9026430">In other words, you don't have to use if you make, you don't have to sell if you make, they are completely exclusive one from another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.616" offset="9064151">And the economic (Inaudible) is the inability of the patentee in this case to collect from the person that has infringed his patent by making the patented machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.606" offset="9124128">Back to Andrea 2, and the majority opinion which says, infringement may not be avoided by a separation or division of courts which leaves to the purchaser a simple task of integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.559" offset="9171880">Reflecting on Andrea 1 which allows the hypothetical that I put of the man going to the Patent Office and copying and making all the parts in the United States selling in FOB in New York, San Francisco, New Orleans, wherever, and off they go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.962" offset="9245545">Now, to answer petitioner's reply brief, they've made some remarks about freedom to copy right up to the extent of the claims of a patent and practically every time a patent is litigated in the United States, the scope of the claims is at issue and there are a number of doctrines that operate in favor of the patentee, there are a number of the doctrines that operate against the patentee, when these claims are put at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.865" offset="9389114">So a narrow technical construction of makes or sells would be out of step with the judicial doctrine that is has developed over the last 150 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.022" offset="9429760">Examples of these, and they all occur in this case, as a matter of fact, are equivalence which allows the patentee to go, it doesn't hold them to the exact literal words of this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.000" offset="9481692">Two examples, one of which was -- both of which were asserted, one of which was applied in this case, are file-wrapper estoppel or statements he makes to the Patent Office restrict him within the literal words of his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.722" offset="9540624">Another example is a doctrine called negative equivalence even where the claim reads right on the machine, the patentee has to prove that the machine is even more an exact copy than the claim might indicate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2384.048" offset="9609901">Not whatsoever, but I was merely pointing out to the Court that there are a number of equitable doctrines that have developed to both limit and expand the patentee's rights during this Court interpretation of the patent system, and the Fifth Circuit correctly realized, I submit the lack of necessity for a legalistic construction of the word makes or sells.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.792" offset="9736856">The multiplicity of lawsuit argument that Mr. Birch made, it seems to me that you want to settle all disputes between the two parties who are really having a war in the same place, if at all possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.713" offset="9820552">Mr. Birch's suggestion would -- we must assume that the patentee is going to try and sell his machine wherever there is a market for it, whether it's in the United States, Brazil, Japan, wherever, under the result we urge, this dispute can be resolved in the United States Court and the patentee is not forced to go overseas and sue its customer or sue his perspective customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.584" offset="9928072">It could be settled, let's say, in one forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.214" offset="9938521">In this case -- in this situation, the result that we urge is a little bit analogous, for example, to the Blonder-Tongue case a year or so ago in this court where the patentee in effect cannot go around the United States and bring 11 lawsuits and get 11 cracks in having this patent help valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.291" offset="10042906">The affirmance of the case below, the decision below is completely concerned with the U.S. constitution because the quid pro quo in the Patent Clause of the constitution, is you get something for your disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.821" offset="10141022">In this case, with respect to the export market, you get nothing for your disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.207" offset="10182505">If this court reverses the court below, the result will be the complete exemption of exported patentable inventions namely machines from coverage of the United States patent or stated differently, the total emasculation of the United States patent system as it's applied to exported machines and articles of manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.911" offset="10293368">Now regardless of where those articles were destined for in any --</text>

            <text syncTime="2630.536" offset="10595866">The brief of respondent has gone at great lengths and the same argument has been made here about the meaning of the word machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.824" offset="10632960">That is a red hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.292" offset="10638812">What we are talking about here is the patented invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.645" offset="10652291">I think that was made clear by the questions from the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.898" offset="10669323">You don't make a machine with an invoice or a letter or a letter of credit, you make it with nuts and bolts and wrenches and this was what was done only in Brazil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.143" offset="10710283">Now there is no total emasculation of a man's rights, if he doesn't get a patent which covers him in the United States, whatever it is he's sold, if he can go into the foreign country and get it, he is protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.906" offset="10773290">Again, that's where he makes his profit, that's where his market is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.251" offset="10790740">Now all of these equitable doctrines of doctrine of equivalence, doctrine of negative equivalence and the like, all depend upon something that Mr. Shoup has not mentioned and that is the making of an invention in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.993" offset="10853643">Unless an invention is made, there is no equivalent to worry about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.973" offset="10869630">The point here is that an invention is not made in the combination sentence, and I believe it is most material as Mr. Justice Rehnquist brought up, that if the law is that you must assemble the combination in order to have something patentable, you must reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.175" offset="10934413">That is the law of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.852" offset="10941101">It is no subterfuge, that is what the man got his patent for, a combination, unless the defendant makes it, there is no infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.633" offset="10976209">That is a technicality, that's just giving the man what he has coming to him.</text>
