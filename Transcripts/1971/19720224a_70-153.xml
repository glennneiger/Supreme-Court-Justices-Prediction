            <text syncTime="59.122" offset="310462">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.547" offset="324151">The indictments in this case resulted from the dynamite bombing of the Offices of the Central Intelligence Agency Building in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.149" offset="370544">During the course of the pretrial proceedings, motion was made for discovery of information relating to electronic surveillance that might be in possession of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.503" offset="411922">In response to this motion, the Government served upon the movements an affidavit of the Attorney General of United States, in which he acknowledged that one to the defendants, the defendant Plamondon, had been overheard in the course of a surveillance authorized by him in which he deemed necessary in the interest of the National Security United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.299" offset="499171">The affidavits stated that the disclosure of this information would be prejudicial to the interest of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.837" offset="533339">In addition to serving the affidavit on the movements and filing it with the Court, the Government also submitted to the Court for its in camera inspection, the logs of the over hearings requested by the defendants, included in that in that in camera submission, the Government also offered the of -- the proof of the authorization to the Attorney General of United States for the surveillance and question conducted prior to the time of the bombing.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.473" offset="651831">The in camera exhibit will show, which is now before this Court, that it contains a memorandum from the Director of the FBI to the Attorney General, in which he sets forth all of the electric -- electronic surveillances operated by the Government at that time, approved by the Attorney General or by the former Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.305" offset="743155">Prior to submission however, the Government excised the names of the organizations and individuals which were the subject of surveillance with the exception of the organization which this -- which was the subject of surveillance in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.087" offset="806266">That in camera submission will also show, a characterization in the form of the memorandum from the Director of the FBI to the Attorney General, the organization in question, its leadership and its illegal aims and information relating to the fact that the organization was engaged in activities of a type which would ultimately lead to the destruction for the United States Government before some violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.773" offset="917026">This in camera submission would also show that the authorization of the Attorney General was for a limited period only.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.027" offset="954015">It described the premises where the installation surveillance was involved and indicated that the surveillance was subject to periodic review.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.771" offset="1005006">Based upon this in camera submission, the United States urged that the surveillance and question was lawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.623" offset="1236451">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.234" offset="1250871">The Government’s position based upon this in camera submission and the affidavit of the Attorney General was at the surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.632" offset="1276471">It was a lawful as reasonable exercise of the presidential powers in the area of national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.146" offset="1306564">The District Court after reviewing the in camera submission and I should point out in this regard, that the in camera submission was not intended as a justification for the authorization but simply of proof of the fact that the authorization had been granted by the Attorney General of the United States over his own signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.429" offset="1399664">The respondent court, Judge Keith, held based upon the affidavit and the in camera submission that the overhearing should be disclosed to the defendants as a plaintiff to an evidentiary hearing to determine whether or not the information contained on the logs contributed in any ways to the prosecution of the defendant Plamondon.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.568" offset="1500183">It took -- made this holding on the basis that the President of United States was without authority to authorize a surveillance absent -- the judicial in a position of a warrant by sitting a federal judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.621" offset="1560474">The United States immediately petitioned for a writ of mandamus to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Sixth Circuit unanimously held that mandamus was an appropriate remedy but by a divided Court concurred in the judgment of the District Court on the basis, in the words of Justice Edwards, that there was not one phrase or word in the Constitution in the United States, in the statutory law of United States or the case law of the United States that exempted the President of United States from the provisions of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.829" offset="1705297">We do not contend here, Your Honors that the President of the United States either individually or acting through the Attorney General is exempt from the provisions of the Fourth Amendment or is above the provisions of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.196" offset="1762766">We do suggest that this case puts into issue an intelligence function and procedure which has been sanctioned by six successive Presidents acting through 12 successive Attorneys General.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.108" offset="1818355">And while the Constitutional issue is grave and the stakes as far as the Government are concerned is high, the issue before the Court can be easily framed.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.975" offset="1865898">Stated negatively, the question is not whether electronic surveillance is a permissible governmental tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.639" offset="1904454">More narrowly claimed, the question is whether in a limited area of counterintelligence activities, the President of the United States may authorize electronic surveillance in the absence of a warrant by a member of the judiciary of this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.241" offset="1986897">In order to understand the case and to properly resolve it, I think we must first understand the factual setting as distinguished from the other cases that have been before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.949" offset="2033708">This is not a case such as the Katz case or the Black case or O’Brian or Alderman, where electronic surveillance was authorized for the purpose of obtaining prosecutive evidence in a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.745" offset="2096924">Nor is it a case as in those cases where the defendant was the target of the electronic surveillance which was authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.054" offset="2134123">We have here as we had in the Clay case, a situation where one of the defendants unfortuitously or fortuitously depending upon the outcome of this case happen to dial a number which was the subject of a surveillance authorized by the President of the United States acting through the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.753" offset="2224924">The Government contends contrary to the distinction made by the lower court, that the President of the United States is imbued with two powers in order to carry out two responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.131" offset="2286469">Both lower courts distinguished the Clay case on the grounds that the power exercised in that case was an aid of the powers of the President in the area of Foreign Affairs related that power to defending the interest of the United States against the acts of hostile foreign powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.471" offset="2363791">United States urges that they -- these two powers are separate and distinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.126" offset="2386466">The one power or the power of the President in the area of Foreign Affairs is granted upon the fact that the President is the exclusive national organ of the United States in the area of Foreign Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.825" offset="2441218">The other power is granted upon the responsibility and obligation of the President to protect the security of the United States against its enemies whether foreign or domestic.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.296" offset="2495135">Because counterintelligence activities often involved both powers, there’s some confusion has come to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.716" offset="2540797">In counterintelligence activities involved in the area of Foreign Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.394" offset="2563576">The purpose is to -- purpose of the surveillance is to permit the President of United States to obtain the ongoing intelligence information which is necessary to him to compete on at least an equal footing with the information obtained by foreign powers with whom he has to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.775" offset="2641003">In the area of National Security however, the intelligence that is sought is for an entirely different purpose and the power and responsibility are grounded upon the President’s function in protecting the National Security against the enemies of the United States whether foreign or domestic.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.678" offset="2728670">Out of this confusion in dichotomy, the cases have discussed both powers as if they were one, and I think these case points up most eloquently the confusion which has existed between foreign and domestic intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.244" offset="2818949">The Government contends that as a legal and as a practical matter you cannot distinguish between foreign and domestic intelligence unless you use the situs of the installation as a basis for making a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.478" offset="2879866">Both lower courts however were not confused with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.522" offset="2896062">They did not reach it.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.018" offset="2905989">The respondent court grounded its decision on the basis that the intelligence function exercised here was for the purpose of surveiling a domestic organization and failed to distinguish the difference between surveiling for the purpose of obtaining intelligence information as distinguished from the nature of the organization from which the intelligence was sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.580" offset="3012255">We suggest also that the constitutional authority of the President is not found in any one provision or any one Article but may be gleaned from the Constitution as a whole and I speak now only for the Constitutional authority of the President in the area of National Security Affairs.</text>

            <text syncTime="758.139" offset="3106505">Does the Congress of the United States has a great deal of constitutional authority in the area of internal security and domestic affairs.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.528" offset="3176095">The Congress has undoubted authority in the area of national security, I think you, as pointed out in the amicus brief filed by the National Lawyers Guild and the Black Panther Party in Article 1 Section 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.826" offset="3233251">The Constitution provides the States that the Congress shall provide for the calling of the Militia of the United States in the event of insurrection.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.251" offset="3282988">The amicus brief asserts that because of this provision, the Congress of the United States as distinguished from the President is -- has fair amount authority in the area of the internal affairs of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.676" offset="3356653">I would point out in that regard that the Second Congress confederates of the provision of Article 1 Section 15, did provide for the calling of the militia and repose that responsibility in the President of the United States, post statutes enacted it the Second Congress now subsist in 10 U.S.C. 1031 and 1032.</text>

            <text syncTime="2650.263" offset="10675014">Mr. Kinoy and I have made up a loose arrangement for dividing the argument here and that in addition to supplementing my argument on the main issue he will, I think, deal specially and specially with the matter of the Alderman decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2679.149" offset="10790580">I want to come soon to the Government’s papers but not too soon because I am very clear on one thing the Government’s case has many infirmities, fundamental infirmities that go, that transcend the form of their papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.585" offset="10884307">There may have been controversy in this Court in the past about the scope and about the wisdom of the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement but prior to this case, there has never been a serious challenge to the basic rule that ordinarily searches and seizures must be made pursuant to duly issued warrants and if they’re not, they are unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.516" offset="11008023">Indeed, the Government for 40 years has admitted repeatedly that the fruits of electronic surveillance, the fruits of unauthorized searchers and seizures are not admissible in evidence to all during this period to which Mr. Justice Marshall referred when the Department of Justice was operating under presidential authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.287" offset="11119096">The Government admitted, during all that period, that the fruits of their searches were not admissible in evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2790.226" offset="11234871">Which -- you’re quite right Mr. Justice Stewart and the -- under the interpretation of that Act by the Attorney General, the proscription was against disclosure and all the Attorney Generals admitted that the disclosure point that they could not disclose and if they disclosed the fruits, there was a violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.115" offset="11350436">But during of all of that period the Attorney General sponsored many Bills in Congress to secure the right to wiretap and all of those Bills where either defeated or withdrawn because Congress was concern about the definition of more power about national security and that they were afraid abuses and so, not until 1968 was legislation adopted that overrode the 1934 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.326" offset="11507275">Obviously, this case -- in this case the Government does not claim that the electronic searcher falls within the -- in any of the recognized exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.526" offset="11560043">It seeks instead that it did in Katz.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.110" offset="11574358">A new exemption indeed, it seeks for all searches that the Attorney General may have characterized or may label national security, an exemption from any meaningful judicial supervision either before or after the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.599" offset="11660353">Thus, the Government in effect presents a startling proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.847" offset="11689297">It is that also called national security searches and seizures are non-justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.024" offset="11722002">They simply are beyond the reach, beyond the competence of the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.121" offset="11750423">They are for the Attorney General, the Executive alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.174" offset="11774665">The wiretap here involved was ordered because and only because the Attorney General unilaterally determined that it was reasonable to gather domestic intelligence information deemed necessary as he put it, now I want be of clear about his language, to protect the nation from attempts of the domestic organizations to attack and submerge the existing structure of the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3332.299" offset="13403138">They make some vague statements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3366.282" offset="13539080">Now, they say and this is as far as they go and this is as much as they say on page 8, the fact that an organization is domestic does not mean that its activities cannot involve foreign intelligence operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.972" offset="13589862">A domestic organization for example, may have a large number of significant foreign contacts in association that may influence, may have a large number, and may influence or they even call these domestic activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.229" offset="13634897">Similarly, individuals connect with the domestic organization themselves may have such foreign ties and then they go on to say, it’s a practical impossibility to find the distinctions such as organization unless one uses the principle of geographic size and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.707" offset="13696755">The District Court did not consider this problem but granted decision on the fact that the organization is distinguished from the intelligence sought was wholly domestic.</text>

            <text syncTime="3894.994" offset="15653953">In the exercise the foregoing powers may be received in evidence in any trial hearing or other proceedings only where such interception was reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3915.065" offset="15734201">Well, the committee reports are quite clear on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.835" offset="15749248">They interpret reasonable just as this Court interpreted in Camara and in Katz and in Berger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.959" offset="15781744">They say reasonable the test reasonable is a standard reasonableness shall be the probable cause test under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.410" offset="15819569">They make it very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.552" offset="15824167">So when they use this -- the Congress used this language they meant that in a domestic situation if the Government expected to use the evidence -- the fruits of the electronic surveillance in evidence then they must -- it must be reasonably obtained and that means under the Fourth Amendment probable cause test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.214" offset="15946838">They say, the Government says the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit all searches and seizures without warrant but only unreasonable ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.037" offset="15986126">The test for determining reasonable as they say is to weigh the competing interest involved and they then purport the balance of competing interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.701" offset="16024787">And they say, they find naturally, that the Government interest in protecting national security, the physical security of this country had ways the invasion of personal rights result -- resulting from the surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.382" offset="16071494">Of course, it ignores the essential second step in the procedure and as I say there is unfair weighing if they are weighing the national security against the rights of these three defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.161" offset="16114544">But determination of whether search is unreasonable involved more than a weighing of the competing interest, the process must begin with to quote this Court in Camara, I never known that correct pronunciation, I hope it’s Camara.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.053" offset="16170133">One governing principles justified by history by current experience that is consistently been followed that except and certainly carefully defined classes of cases of search of private property without proper consent is unreasonable unless it had been authorized by a valid search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.793" offset="16241081">The warrant procurement is not merely one method of assuring reasonable search, it is crucial and it is generally indispensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.369" offset="16275458">Probable cause set in the Court in Camara is the standard by which the constitutional mandate a reasonable as it is tested and the burden, the burden is on those seeking an exemption from warrant requirement the show a need for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.935" offset="16329689">Not just a need to search but the need the search without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.431" offset="16351631">Now, of course there’s a Governmental interests who would dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.413" offset="16367618">There's a Governmental interests in protecting the fabric of society so as the Government puts in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.696" offset="16388725">But that’s not the interests as take in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.006" offset="16398025">In Camara, as you recall and that almost identical argument was made in principle, “That the general health and safety of the entire urban population is dependent upon enforcement of minimum fire housing and sanitation standard.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.429" offset="16459674">Then, thus it was claim at required systematized inspection of all physical structures about a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.907" offset="16485587">But as this Court noted the argument missed the mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.960" offset="16497813">The question knows not whether these inspections may be made but whether they may be made without a warrant and so it is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.429" offset="16543684">But the warrant procurement is no mere formality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.937" offset="16561656">We agree with the Attorney General that the President is responsible for ensuring our system of Government as a viable entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.778" offset="16597078">Indeed his duty is even greater than that, greater and more formidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.131" offset="16614423">He sworn not to protect the Government as such but to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States but his powers must be exercise and the need for information satisfied to a constitutionally proper means.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.849" offset="16677326">And the constitution limits the President even in his most awesome responsibilities that this Court has held in a number of cases and that we don’t subscribe to the inherent power of argument, the Government made it in the lower court and in the Court of Appeals that would do formatting its main brief in this case and now it seems to back to the inherent power of argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="4512.186" offset="18122733">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4517.151" offset="18142586">I rise before this Court to represent the three individual respondents John Sinclair, Lawrence Plamondon, and John Forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.956" offset="18185741">But as the Court of Appeals has stated so powerfully in the opinion before this Court, the thrust of this case now goes far beyond the rights and liberties of these three young men.</text>
            <text syncTime="4544.413" offset="18251569">The Government has seen that to use this case as a vehicle for propelling a claim of executive power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.254" offset="18299008">So ominous in its importation and sweeping in its dimension that is as transform this appeal into a case which as this Court has said touches the bedrock of our political system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4573.670" offset="18368598">Mr. Mardian has seen fit this morning to call upon the authority of the Great Chief Justice in Mulberry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4583.148" offset="18406528">I would suggest to the Court that in the words of that Chief Justice this case had become on of those rare cases of peculiar delicacy which call for the historic role of this Court as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.467" offset="18503808">Now, the considerations I suggest to the Court, awesome and foreboding which permeate the opinions of the District Court and the Court of Appeals arise out of an openly expressed and prime attempt by the executive to use this case to obtain the imprimatur of this Court for a program of domestic and I stressed that word, domestic espionage and surveillance of political opponents on Presidents in our history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.464" offset="18675798">Mr. Gossett has exposed fully, I believe the essence of the executive’s claim of executive power to engage in wholesale wiretapping of American citizens without regard for the Fourth Amendment commands of prior judicial approval by a neutral magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4673.455" offset="18767749">The very point of the First Amendment -- of the Fourth Amendment which this Court has thought so recently in Coolidge, in Camara without a showing of probable cause or the necessity of particularity whenever in his sole and unchallenged judgment the ideas, associations or political activities of these citizens may constitute an attempt and here I used his words to subvert the existing structure of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.091" offset="18922289">Now, as Mr. Gossett has pointed out and in the words of Judge Edwards in the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, this would -- to place it bluntly, erase the Fourth Amendment from the domestic light of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4730.356" offset="18995328">The Amendment which this Court has thought is the embodiment of fundamental principles of liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.709" offset="19020823">But I would like to suggest to the Court that the most serious consequences which would flow from this Court’s placing its imprimatur upon this claim of power would be the stifling of the political freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment, the continued vitality of which rests.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.607" offset="19148405">It’s been great deal of discussion today about the security of the Republic and the security of this Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4777.554" offset="19184141">Well, Mr. Mardian did not include in his discussion to the Court, the deepest teachings of this Court that the security of the Republic basically depends upon preserving the essence of this system of political freedom, those great words of the Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.229" offset="19266897">Justice Hughes in De Jonge, preserving the essence of the political freedoms of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4804.919" offset="19293646">Now the fear or the excessive and uncontrolled executive power which permeates the Court of Appeals’ opinion and the opinion of the Respondent District Judge, the fear of this power, to sweep aside Fourth Amendment protection against what?</text>
            <text syncTime="4824.789" offset="19373058">Against warrantless general searches and seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.055" offset="19386120">I suggest to the Court that not since the days in 1761 when the Board of Massachusetts Court, James Otis pleaded a case as a more classic general search ever come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4845.444" offset="19455710">Here you have a search of 14 months duration by the Government words, 14 months duration over 900 telephone calls involving, Lord knows how many thousands of people who as Mr. Gossett said by mistake dialed a number.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.353" offset="19539406">Now, this fear which is reflected in the Court of Appeals opinion of this unprecedented in his power is based not only on the contemporary European lessons of tear news this country is not supposed to be reflect but is based I suggest on the most important of our own experiences as a people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.231" offset="19658838">That the central teaching of our own history has been that arbitrary general searches and seizures always, not always and that is the teaching and the meaning of the essence of our experience of the people is the pact to the assertion of theoretical control over the lives of people and this I suggest to the Court, is the brilliant heart of the Court of Appeals’ opinion which is here for review by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4930.657" offset="19796555">The concepts of the Court of Appeals that beyond doubt, the First Amendment is the cornerstone of American Freedom and the Fourth Amendment stands as the guardian of the First and this reflects the teaching of this Court in Marcus, that the Bill of Rights itself, the Fourth Amendment was fashioned against the background of knowledge that unrestricted power of search and seizure was an instrument for stifling liberty of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.555" offset="19936154">Now the power which the Attorney General seeks here, would legitimatized a widespread dragnet of a secret surveillance of domestic political opposition of which the present record Appendix A to our brief for example is but a tiny preview already the subjects of the Attorney General’s suspicion and I used that word advisably for on leaders of the Anti-war Movement, Black Militant, Catholic Activists, pacifists, Advocates of Youth Culture but what is the deep danger to the country that this claim represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5008.634" offset="20108458">As formulated here this morning and in the brief submitted to this Court, that claim of power can include anyone who speaks out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5019.295" offset="20151089">Now, I put it bluntly to the Court that this is not an exaggeration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.401" offset="20175540">I put to the Court the example of the reason suggestion from high quarters in the executive department that critics of the proposals made by the President of the United States in respect to the Vietnam War and I used their own words, are consciously aiding and abetting the enemy of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5053.239" offset="20286926">That was the Chief of Staff of the White House two weeks ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.628" offset="20308451">Now, I suggest to the Court would these critics be included within the scope of this domestic surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5071.451" offset="20359755">They’re aiding and abetting the enemy of the United States during there phones can be tapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="5079.615" offset="20392461">Now, I would say to the Court that the question asked by this Court in Baggett-Bullitt, where does principle possibility end and intended coverage begins goes to the heart of this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.642" offset="20464559">Goes to the heart of this issue unless this program now loudly proclaimed by the executive of uncontrolled executive warrantless open ended wiretapping of domestic political opponents unless this is decisively repudiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5121.084" offset="20558286">Not sidestepped and I urge deeply decisively repudiated by this Court, the inevitable effect will be not to -- and here I pause for a moment, I will not use the word which I heard the Solicitor two days ago before this Court say, “Was overworked in this Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5144.792" offset="20653163">I will not say that the inevitable effect will be to chill the exercise of democratic right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5152.146" offset="20682524">I would say the inevitable effect will be to choke and stifle.</text>
            <text syncTime="5157.376" offset="20703422">The exercise of First Amendment rights by millions of American citizen, millions of American citizens and I call to the Court’s attention the poignant and incisive discussion of Judge Kiley of the Court of Appeals in the Seventh Circuit in his fascinating article, Private in Black Standard, which he warned us all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.143" offset="20814495">Speaking of this pattern and danger of surveillance, that it seems enough to contemplate this specter of a big brother observing how we think, we feel and act and the oppressive, moral and political climate they were tend to suffocate our freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="5207.285" offset="20903102">Now, to me the most disturbing aspect of this case is the frank willingness of the executive to engage in such a program and in its eagerness to sustain such a program, the executive attempt to evade the prohibitions of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5227.409" offset="20983560">The question Justice Marshall asked from the bench to Mr. Mardian by saying as -- Mr. Mardian said here this morning that this program of domestic political espionage is unrelated to any criminal investigated activity but is merely unintelligence gathering operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.905" offset="21077600">But what Mr. Mardian does not discuss is that attempt to evade the protections of the Fourth Amendment was repudiated by this Court directly squarely and head on in Camara.</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.489" offset="21151893">When the opinion of the Court, Justice White’s opinion of the Court, met head on the argument there made by the state authorities that we're not involved in this Fourth Amendment problem because our intention is not to look for criminal violations, we're looking for other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5292.117" offset="21242381">Go to the health and safety of the community and this Court said that that misses the whole point and what did it do in the fascinating way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5302.046" offset="21282087">The majority opinion according to Camara adopted approvingly the dissenting opinion of Justice Brennan in Abel, Abel against United States in which the justice pointed out and reflected in the Camara opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.896" offset="21333496">That this misses the whole point of the Fourth Amendment that the right protected by the Fourth Amendment is not the right to be secure from having evidence of criminal activity taken from you unreasonably.</text>
            <text syncTime="5329.418" offset="21391592">That’s not the right to protect it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.967" offset="21401832">The right to protect it is to use again the words of these Court again and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.763" offset="21429000">The sacred inalienable -- the right that used in Boyd, the words in Boyd, the words of Justice Brandies in Olmstead, the absolute right to privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5350.604" offset="21476333">That the issue is not, why that right is being violated?</text>
            <text syncTime="5357.934" offset="21505695">The Fourth Amendment stands to protect the citizens of this country from arbitrary invasion of there right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5368.793" offset="21549163">It stuns me a little bit to hear the arguments made by a Representative of today’s executive which were made by the Representatives of George the III in Entick against Carrington, the precise argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5385.598" offset="21616350">This Court is told as was the British Court in Entick that courts cannot look at the reasons for the searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="5397.260" offset="21662952">That resides in the special knowledge of the crown.</text>
            <text syncTime="5402.623" offset="21684477">The British Court was told in Entick, you must sanction this general search for -- and neither words from Entick for reasons of state, for reasons of necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5417.411" offset="21743618">No, we cannot tell you all the facts of those because they reside in the head of our Chief Executive Officer known as the Secretary of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5427.209" offset="21782802">Those were precisely the arguments raised in Entick.</text>
            <text syncTime="5431.298" offset="21799102">Those were the arguments, the Fourth Amendment was designed to eliminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5436.714" offset="21820836">Mr. Mardian’s argument is not with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5440.829" offset="21837241">Mr. Mardian’s argument is with those who wrote the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5448.077" offset="21866289">Mr. Mardian’s argument and the Government’s brief reads as if saying that, “Oh, it is perfectly alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="5456.360" offset="21899413">We can do all these things because we are conducting investigative intelligence gathering as if the executive has limitless uncontrolled powers in the area of political association belief and activities.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5473.988" offset="21969943">All of which as this Court towards in Stanford, all of which are affected by the general searches conducted here, as if the general searches because the Government there -- the general executive, I think it is important for us to be precise in our language here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5494.219" offset="22050818">I prefer not to use the term, "The Government" here, the issue was too profound and too serious.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.865" offset="22081434">The executive says that if these general searches are conducted unrelated to the purposes of immediate criminal prosecution then we can do whatever we like.</text>
            <text syncTime="5513.918" offset="22129604">In the vast area of political association believes in activity we can have whatever wiretapping we want to have there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.105" offset="22154368">It doesn’t matter what effect it has on people’s willingness to engage in political activity, on people’s willingness to engage in political association.</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.450" offset="22203791">I suggest that this Court has thought and only recently as reaffirmed the profound words which this Court now has written into fundamental law of Justice Brandies concurring in Whitney against California, only recently in Brandenburg with this Court write those words into the fabric of our law, that Government action which impinges on the delicate and vulnerable freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.999" offset="22333986">The words of -- but is tolerated if at all only when required to prevent the most eminent immediate serious role attraction of a clear and present danger of a substantive evil of a serious nature within the power of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5589.690" offset="22432729">But the argument of the executive here is a total rejection of Justice Brandies’ philosophy and the philosophy, I suggest of this Court and the philosophy of the Constitution of the United States which Mr. Mardian has told us the President is one to uphold.</text>
            <text syncTime="5608.248" offset="22506916">Because the executive now demands the power for general searches in the area of domestic political activity in the absence of any showing of probable cause for criminal prosecution on the uncheck say so of one man and we were told this morning that the absolute sacred privacy right to the American citizens are best protected in the hands of a one man.</text>
            <text syncTime="5638.836" offset="22629274">Now, those who wrote the Fourth Amendment did not agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5642.341" offset="22643275">And that -- this Court said in Coolidge just last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="5646.191" offset="22658740">Those fundamental values are sometimes question these days.</text>
            <text syncTime="5652.589" offset="22684340">This Court said, sometimes people feel that these values, they don’t work.</text>
            <text syncTime="5658.828" offset="22709313">And the Court pointed out that use the words, feel of internal subversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.713" offset="22728853">Sometimes makes us shake about these values but that’s what this Court seeks here for is to protect those fundamental values.</text>
            <text syncTime="5674.631" offset="22772425">Those judgments were made when the Fourth Amendment was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.596" offset="22792382">Now, I suggest to the Court that no program of Government activities which touches the area of the First Amendment Right has ever come before this Court for review which so totally ignores the most elementary teachings of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.974" offset="22893842">Examination of the Attorney General’s affidavit, perhaps the most imprecise, overly broad, vague, dragnet type standard, words ever brought before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5718.514" offset="22947968">Compare it to the words sanctioned in governmental actions struck down in Baggett-Bullitt, struck down in Cramp, struck down in the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5728.470" offset="22987778">This Court says that when Fourth Amendment problem touches the First Amendment, in the Stanford, precision and strict formulations are required.</text>
            <text syncTime="5741.744" offset="23040964">This is -- has reflect precision, strict formulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5747.399" offset="23063533">Now, I can understand why the Government is so desperately trying in this Court to bury the Attorney General’s affidavit as the basis for there action upon the psychic’s pricing from a litigation point of view, from an elementary thinnest point of view that the first time the executive takes the position that the Attorney General’s affidavit is not what you look to define the basis for the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="5775.920" offset="23177636">The first time they took that position is in the reply brief we got five days before this oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5782.079" offset="23202296">You look back to their main brief, go back to the original brief filed in the District Court that Judge Keith acted on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.911" offset="23233643">Go back to the brief filed in the Court of Appeals to the Sixth Circuit and then what’s so interesting, recently we argued in the Seventh Circuit the identical issue with other representatives of the executive in United States against Dillinger and in the Seventh Circuit, the representatives of Department Justice got up and said, when question from the bench as to what's the basis for the searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="5816.099" offset="23338342">They all look at the Attorney General’s affidavit Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5819.763" offset="23352970">No!</text>
            <text syncTime="5820.214" offset="23354851">In this Court now they’re running from that affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5823.719" offset="23368853">It's perfectly clear why they're running from the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5826.719" offset="23380869">Cause the affidavit on its face reveals the fundamental violation of the First and Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5835.719" offset="23416813">But in one sense there is something deeply serious that is reflected by their running from the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5844.692" offset="23452758">Now these five days prior to argument, the citizens are not even allowed to know the basis for the depravation of fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5880.554" offset="23596118">What are we told?</text>
            <text syncTime="5859.713" offset="23596013">No, you cannot look at the Attorney General’s affidavit any longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5862.793" offset="23595909">That’s not the reason for the right and what kind of limit in judicial review can there be if the citizens doesn’t even know.</text>
            <text syncTime="5870.021" offset="23595804">Forget about the facts underlying the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5873.864" offset="23595700">It doesn’t even know what the basic for it, the claim of right to set aside Fourth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5882.439" offset="23603746">That basis is in secret document which in a magic way seem to enlarge as this case goes on -- the documents before Judge Keith.</text>
            <text syncTime="5894.731" offset="23652856">Then all of a sudden there is supplemental envelops before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5898.740" offset="23668947">Then all of a sudden there are new envelops filed before this Court and here they’re not so secret these envelops.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.023" offset="23702071">What’s in them?</text>
            <text syncTime="5908.059" offset="23706146">Because whenever it suits the executive convenience they tell us and the Courts openly, publicly what are in them, but for the first time today, they were astounding to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="5918.147" offset="23746583">For the first time today, we were told in this litigation that in these envelopes there is a memorandum from the head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation discussing prior wiretaps and prior surveillances.</text>
            <text syncTime="5931.368" offset="23799455">We never heard that before?</text>
            <text syncTime="5932.271" offset="23803008">Well, if that was so secret that it can now be discussed and openly before this Court, why weren’t we told a long time ago?</text>
            <text syncTime="5938.935" offset="23829653">But what emerges is that if the bases for the deprivation of fundamental rights are in the secret documents which we don’t know and we can’t see, which we can’t even challenge, I suggest that we have a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5957.254" offset="23903004">Now in 1972, we’ve already run in 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="5964.316" offset="23931217">Nothing could be more (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="5967.263" offset="23943024">Nothing could be more grotesque.</text>
            <text syncTime="5969.679" offset="23952637">In the situation in which we don’t even know what the basis for the deprivation of fundamental rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5977.192" offset="23982730">What does this do?</text>
            <text syncTime="5977.962" offset="23985760">It makes a mockery of any pretense of judicial review, supposedly a safeguard.</text>
            <text syncTime="5985.237" offset="24014913">Now, I would suggest that if sanctioned by this Court, this warrantless general wiretapping of domestic and I stress that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5998.113" offset="24066426">There is no question here of the so called foreign intelligence exception discussed in Katz, discussed in Giordano.</text>
            <text syncTime="6006.025" offset="24098087">This was not supposed to be a test case from the Government’s point view from the executive’s point view of the so called foreign exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="6013.007" offset="24125986">They allowed the -- from one into the country of the Attorney General’s big speeches in which he talked about this case, which he said they are testing the domestic, their right to have domestic surveillance of so called domestic subversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6027.290" offset="24183142">All of a sudden they discovered they run very shaky constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="6031.631" offset="24200487">So at the last moment, they tried to infect this case with an inference of foreign affair.</text>
            <text syncTime="6039.091" offset="24230266">Why suggest to this Court that it is not so difficult to disentangle one from the other?</text>
            <text syncTime="6046.525" offset="24260046">That this throughout the history of this country have been the sorts of the most serious eroding, the most serious eroding of constitutional liberties, at every turning point in the history of a nation where there’s been a challenged to fundamental constitutional liberties, it has always been in the name of foreign agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6071.029" offset="24358058">When the first attack on Jefferson and the Jeffersonion submerged, what was it?</text>
            <text syncTime="6074.937" offset="24373731">They were French Agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="6076.610" offset="24380418">And therefore Alien Position Act was alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="6079.822" offset="24393271">First, you study the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6082.185" offset="24402675">Pull them in trial for sedition, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="6084.044" offset="24410093">Because they were French Agents, foreign agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="6088.132" offset="24426498">This Court is well aware of the same development around the promenades and the members of this Court was the author of that famouse document practically with the Department of Justice, Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6102.761" offset="24485013">Pointing out, there once again end of World War I, the fear of foreign nation was the thing that intermingled into a cover to destroy, what?</text>
            <text syncTime="6115.929" offset="24537675">Constitutional protections for American citizens, for American citizens, and this Court has lived through and proudly emerged from the period of time we all know as the period of the McCarthy period.</text>
            <text syncTime="6133.411" offset="24607579">The period in which once again the fear, the fear, the cold fear of foreign, foreign elements was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="6143.447" offset="24647703">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="6144.005" offset="24650002">To undermine the Fifth Amendment, the present Solicitor General of the United States wrote an important document on the erosion of the Fifth Amendment during that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6157.492" offset="24703919">I suggest we face that problem once again and this Court as it did at each turning point in our history must stand resolute now to reject this effort to introduce the specter of this fear which erodes the fundamental rights of all Americans, not just to three young men before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6187.314" offset="24823246">I think the serious need of what the executive is asking for is reflected in the constitution of theory which it now emerges full blown.</text>
            <text syncTime="6203.588" offset="24888343">The theory that in the domestic area, there is an inherent power to do whatever the executive feels is necessary to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="6214.262" offset="24930975">I will not take time with this because this Court has over and over again rejected that concept only this last June in New York Times in a powerful opinion of the late Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="6229.156" offset="24990534">That doctrine which this Court at the end of the civil war called the most pernicious doctrine in ex parte Milligan, the most pernicious doctrine that the executive do with inherent powers can watch suspend constitutional guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6250.342" offset="25075275">That’s what they’re asking for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6252.599" offset="25084366">The power to suspend constitutional guarantee because they say.</text>
            <text syncTime="6258.971" offset="25109862">No, this is not the system of Government which was created in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="6265.741" offset="25136924">The system of government which is created in this country is that system of limited powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6271.794" offset="25161166">Yes, it may not work as well as Justice Frankfurter pointed out in Youngstown, may not work as well as some other Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6278.989" offset="25189901">Can be more efficient, the oppressive button in another Government you have to worry about warrants, you don’t have to worry about courts, do what you want to do but that’s why this country was set up in the way it was and that’s why this Court sits.</text>
            <text syncTime="6295.104" offset="25254371">Precisely, to protect this country and the citizens of this country from the erosion of the fundamental constitutional values which make us strong and safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="6312.694" offset="25324693">I have exhausted my time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6315.375" offset="25335455">I would like to say one word if I may just, one word on the last question which the executive has raised here in respect to the Alderman case, the Alderman opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6331.782" offset="25401075">I was rather surprised to hear the representative of the executive say that what they are asking for in there brief is consistent with Alderman that I would not argue that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6342.560" offset="25444229">It’s right in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6343.808" offset="25449140">They ask this Court to reconsider Alderman.</text>
            <text syncTime="6346.728" offset="25460843">They ask this Court to overrule Alderman.</text>
            <text syncTime="6349.356" offset="25471396">They ask this Court to throw out its decision of three years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="6354.347" offset="25491354">Well sort out, well reasoned and the thing that settles the inappropriateness of that request at this moment is the question the Chief Justice asked earlier and that is, that the Court of Appeals itself in looking at these lots and the Court will be aware of that at the end of he opinion said, it is impossible for us to say in looking at this very conversations that they might not have been prosecutorial benefit, and therefore it has to be adversary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6386.808" offset="25621130">So that I suggest that this Court should affirm the decision of the Sixth Circuit and in affirming the decision of the Sixth Circuit, this Court will be affirming the Fourth and the First Amendments of the Constitutions of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="6491.880" offset="26041493">In fact, we urged the Abel case in the Sixth Circuit Court and is interesting to note that the Sixth Circuit Court when referring to Abel stated that Mr. Abel was arrested by a warrant which the opinion of the Court found to have been lawfully issued by a lawfully authorized magistrate and that the material seized at the time of his arrest were held legally admissible as incident to that arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6526.176" offset="26178688">A decision in that case was written by Justice Frankfurter.</text>

            <text syncTime="6789.471" offset="27231840">Well, we would not having adversary proceeding in any instance where the overhearing involved matters relating to the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="6797.218" offset="27262874">If there is a distinction between overhearings in so called foreign intelligence cases as distinguished from national security cases, I have been unable as objectively as I can to do distinguish between so called domestic and foreign intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6818.990" offset="27349914">Now, counsel brought up the fact that in one of our footnotes we referred to some documents which we submitted to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal on our motion to augment the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6832.084" offset="27402263">That case came up -- was tried before the Keith case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6835.539" offset="27416056">That -- that’s the Ferguson or Smith case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6838.581" offset="27428281">In Mr. -- Judge Keith’s opinion, he refers in extensile to the opinion of Just -- Judge Ferguson.</text>
            <text syncTime="6847.519" offset="27464017">In the way matter arose was this, in the Smith case which is still pending before this Court, I understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="6854.638" offset="27492542">We made an in camera submission to the Court and I believe that in camera submission consisted a one sheet of paper which again was an incidental overhearing of the defendant Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="6867.155" offset="27542593">We urge in that case that it was national security intelligence tap and I think the record will disclose that it's the same tapped that is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6877.783" offset="27585120">In that case, we urge that the information contained in the log should not be disclosed and its disclosure would not be in the interest and would be prejudicial to the national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="6891.205" offset="27638724">We did not argue in that case nor was the question raised by the Court or by the defendant that that case involved a domestic intelligence case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6903.818" offset="27689192">Yet, in the determination of the Court in the Ninth Circuit case, Judge Ferguson, he held that the Government was required to disclose again as a prelude to attain hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6919.885" offset="27753453">The overhearing on the grounds that and he used the term 13 separate times, purely domestic or wholly domestic organization or purely domestic or wholly domestic intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6936.148" offset="27818551">And yet the only basis for the fact determination was the in camera submission of one sheet of paper which indicated the overhearing of the defendant’s Smith’s voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6950.282" offset="27875080">For that reason when the matter went before the Ninth Circuit, the Government sought to augment the record and to let the Court view all of the overhearings of the surveillance in question to determine whether it was in fact wholly domestic or purely domestic or whether it was a wholly domestic or purely domestic organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="6972.613" offset="27964418">An examination of the logs will disclose that it’s not wholly domestic or purely domestic.</text>
            <text syncTime="6978.478" offset="27987824">Its foreign ties exceeded its domestic ties and it was for that reason that we made that offer to the Court in the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6987.825" offset="28025231">And we would make that offer to this Court, if the Court would like to view the record which we submitted in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6994.063" offset="28050204">Now, with reference to why we footnoted the reference to the Smith case, that footnote, that brief was drawn at the time that Judge Ferguson sought a petition in this Court for certiorari before the determination in the Ninth Circuit and we acquiesce in that petition and sought to have this Court, hear both cases together so that this Court could view the in camera submission which was made at the Circuit Court level stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="7031.613" offset="28200356">I take and I must take some exception to the characterization of this case as an attempt on the part of the Government to engage in electronics surveillance for the purpose of observing the activities of decedent political groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="7053.110" offset="28286351">The statute under which this Government is operating certainly prohibits that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7060.503" offset="28315922">I would also point out that this whole question of electronic surveillance in what is disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7070.849" offset="28357300">This Court must is a coordinate branch of Government rely almost entirely on the integrity of the executive branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="7081.335" offset="28399305">The executive branch, it was the executive branch through the then Solicitor General who now sits on this Court, who made the disclosure to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7092.877" offset="28445489">And in each instance, where a motion is made under Rule 16, it is the integrity of the Government that has to be relied upon unless this Court is going to fashion a rule which would permit every defendant to rummage all of the files of all the investigative agencies of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="7116.898" offset="28541515">Now administratively, we suggest this cannot work.</text>
            <text syncTime="7121.001" offset="28557920">Administratively, it would break down the separation of powers that exist between Government and would also break down the entire law enforcement function of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="7134.022" offset="28610061">Where do we go less than that?</text>
            <text syncTime="7136.362" offset="28619360">When the motion is made, the Government responds.</text>
            <text syncTime="7141.557" offset="28640154">If the Government is not to be trusted to respond with respect to a motion under Rule 16, then it should be expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="7150.896" offset="28677561">I assume from what counsel said to respond honestly with respect to the nature of its activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="7159.574" offset="28712252">Now certainly, this neither President or any prior President to my knowledge is authorized electronic surveillance to monitor the activities of an opposite political group.</text>
            <text syncTime="7174.553" offset="28772124">The only purpose is -- as I have stated; one, to obtain the on going intelligence necessary to compete in the area of foreign affairs and the on-going intelligence necessary for this nation to protect itself against not only as foreign foes but its domestic foes.</text>
            <text syncTime="7192.657" offset="28844536">Now, Counsel Gossett has suggested that we might in this area you use the provisions relating to cases involving sabotage or espionage.</text>
            <text syncTime="7203.493" offset="28887899">I would submit that if it were a sabotage case or an espionage case, we certainly should invoke the provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="7213.287" offset="28927083">But when we’re talking about the on going intelligence function of Government, there is no probable cause in many cases as that term is used in the criminal prosecuted sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="7226.180" offset="28978701">Now, I do not know that it’s an appropriate analogy but certainly the protection of the President of the United States against assassination is one aspect to the nation’s national security.</text>
            <text syncTime="7239.525" offset="29032095">Heads of State have been assassinated to bring down Governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="7243.998" offset="29049963">A simply -- simple cursory examination of the Warren Commission report will find, will disclose numerous instances by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Secret Service were criticized for not having the on going intelligence necessary to provide adequate protection to the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="7268.907" offset="29149542">I suggest again with respect to the provisions of Article 4, Section 4 of the Constitution which the Congress has -- execution of which the Congress is placed in the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="7281.598" offset="29200324">There is no distinction in the constitutional article or in the statutes passed pursuant thereto with respect to the presidential authority as its relates to invasion or civil insurrection.</text>
            <text syncTime="7295.912" offset="29257584">Both require on going intelligence because without that intelligence, the President cannot make an appropriate decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="7306.046" offset="29298126">As the Court held in the Kennedy case, constitution isn’t a suicide act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7313.167" offset="29326652">The President can’t wait until the moment of invasion or insurrection to start putting together a counterintelligence function.</text>
            <text syncTime="7321.740" offset="29360924">The President must have this information if he’s to carry out his responsibilities under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="7328.344" offset="29387360">To defend this nation against invasion or domestic violence and we submit that the record of the past six Presidents and the past 12 Attorneys General is deserving of the high esteem of this Court, is deserving of permitting the Chief Executive to carry out his functions under the constitution and within the constraints of the Fourth Amendment as I have attempted to define them here.</text>
