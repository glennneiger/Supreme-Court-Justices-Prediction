            <label>Mr. Michael A. Querques</label>
            <text syncTime="27.414" offset="183350">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.390" offset="195262">The facts of this particular matter sparse as they are warrant some little attention here this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.391" offset="223265">Sometime in 1969, Mr. Zicarelli was served with subpoena to appear before a new commission in New Jersey which is called a State Commission of Investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.161" offset="262344">The State Commission of Investigation was operating under something else which was new in New Jersey, and that is a so called Use Immunity or Testimonial Immunity Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.246" offset="306648">Consequently, as result of being asked questions and being offered the immunity, which was provided for by the statute, Mr. Zicarelli chose to invoke his privilege under the Fifth Amendment not to testify on the grounds that use immunity so called was not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.889" offset="385224">He was not upheld in that argument, and ultimately was held in contempt and appeal was taken to the New Jersey Supreme Court and again, his claim of privilege under the Fifth was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.219" offset="430573">As a result of which, under the statute in New Jersey, somewhat peculiar statute, Mr. Zicarelli was confined to an institution in Yardville, New Jersey, presumably for the rest of his life because the statute in New Jersey provides for no particular period of confinement and it was a civil contempt, civil confinement and as I say, no particular period of cut off.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael A. Querques</label>
            <text syncTime="121.584" offset="560036">Yes Your honor, he would have been released.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="123.033" offset="565782">He did, as in most civil contempts, he carried the keys to jail in his own pocket?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael A. Querques</label>
            <text syncTime="128.794" offset="588875">That is accurate, your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.991" offset="601622">So, we are faced then in this case with the ultimate issue as to whether or not, so called use or testimonial immunity is consistent with the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.887" offset="653240">And, this ultimate issue as far as I can make it out from all of the cases that I have read, depends upon the particular answer that you give to the one single test, and that is whether or not, the witness is in the same position, after he has testified as though he had not testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.417" offset="743311">And therefore, I would like to try this morning to persuade this Court that a witness such as Mr. Zicarelli would be in a far worst position after he testified then if he had not testified under this use immunity statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="202.156" offset="882282">There is a case out of the Third Circuit, Catena involving other individual who had exactly the same problem and the I think that the opinion by Chief Judge Sykes in that case is certainly applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.913" offset="949364">Chief Judge Sykes says that the Defendant is in a worst position or stated differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.315" offset="974964">He is not in the same position as though he had not testified because once the District Attorney would have that compelled testimony, the District Attorney would be able to use that compelled testimony in cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.701" offset="1036509">And Chief Judge Sykes says even if there were no over reference to the compelled testimony, the questions could be phrased in such a way that the use of the compelled testimony would necessarily impeach and damage the Defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.435" offset="1143402">Is there anything about the use immunity granted before the Grand Jury or investigative body that would prevent him from claiming his Fifth Amendment privileges anew on any new matter when he was called as the witness in the trial or subjected to cross examination?</text>

            <text syncTime="286.707" offset="1220516">I am not certain that I understand the question but if I do, as I understand the use immunity, it would be of no avail to the Defendant facing the prosecution to raise it all over again because it could be used --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="302.322" offset="1283000">I repeat my question.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.376" offset="1287180">When he is in the Court room for the trial, though some case subsequent to his Grand Jury appearance or in your case appearance before the Commission, is there anything that prevents him from using the Fifth Amendment?</text>
            <text syncTime="321.427" offset="1359382">If he is subjected to a question which he thinks in and of itself will incriminate him?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_a_querques" startTime="328.336" stopTime="509.910">
            <label>Mr. Michael A. Querques</label>
            <text syncTime="328.336" offset="1387072">Well, I think that question is also answered by Judge Sykes and that argument goes along these lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.224" offset="1422599">That the Defendant, even if assured that the answers he gave in the compelled testimony before the Grand Jury or before a Commission would not be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.809" offset="1460947">Nonetheless, it would bear on his mind and he would therefore be influenced to forego and give up or forsake that right that he would have to defend himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.353" offset="1511102">And I think, that is a very crucial consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.909" offset="1529283">Leaving that answer and going to the next one that I have in mind, and that is the one by Justice Brennan in the Picarello(ph) decision the dissent, and that would be that the uncertainties of the fact finding process and the hazards to the witness argue very strongly against use immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.769" offset="1616741">I do not think that anyone could argue against the fact that the Government would have all of the relevant evidence, and any of us who had experience with the Government know that they are files and then there are confidential files.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.158" offset="1674315">Many, many times, if not indeed all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.212" offset="1686540">The young District Attorney trying a case in the Federal Court is completely unaware of so called confidential information resting in the confidential file of the Secret Service or Immigration Authorities or the FBI offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.347" offset="1743069">And consequently, he is not in a position though the burden would be on the Government to show that the prosecution is untainted.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.545" offset="1779849">He would be in no position to rebut the evidence offered by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.262" offset="1802733">In addition to that, the best defense for a person placed in the situation where he has to testify under use immunity could never establish if there was for example, an accidental or an unrecorded exchange of information which somehow tainted his indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.991" offset="1881622">There would be no way of showing that a poor memory was attendant to the situation in order to show the taint.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.252" offset="1930733">Many times, and I think that this Court has seen it recently proofs are lost through either death, through resignation, through disability or through retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.576" offset="1975977">The case that I am thinking about is the recent case out of New York of Santa Belo where one Prosecutor made a so called arrangement with the Defendant, and then as a result of leaving his position, another District Attorney came in and would not honor the arrangement previously made.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.976" offset="2049642">You could have exactly the same situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.127" offset="2058210">One District Attorney would leave his office or would die or retire, and something that was left behind could be used by someone else and the Defendant could never establish it because of that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1076.904" offset="4381332">That is a white color crime, say he did not have criminal knowledge or willful intent sufficient to satisfy the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.794" offset="4408813">I could even concede that he might plead and trap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.382" offset="4419262">But in any event, I see that he would setup some perjurious story, so that would not have to confess and at the same time, he would not have to go to jail for contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.998" offset="4469730">I think it is fairly likely that the person who would not want to accuse himself and at the same time would not want to run the risk of perjury would do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.652" offset="4504316">He would say, for example, there are two years or maybe three years left before the statute of limitations expires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.039" offset="4537858">And so, I will take the contempt and have myself incarcerated, and wade out the statute of limitations because it is easier to wade out a two or three year-balance on the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.426" offset="4587386">Than it would be to face the indictment and prosecution and then perhaps do 10, 20 or 30 years in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.445" offset="4619464">Now because, that situation will occur and it will occur in every single case where use immunity is used, the witness will have to make a choice of one of those three, there is no other choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.640" offset="4676202">I say most respectfully that the State, the Federal Government or whoever it maybe is doing something very, very distasteful, and something very, very contrary to the American concept of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.077" offset="4742031">Because it is, actually inducing or coercing a crime to take place which has not yet taken place to it the crime of perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.447" offset="4795425">If that is not the result, the result is that the man goes to jail for contempt, that is also foreign to our system of justice because you call on a suspect, he refuses to answer the questions, and he ends up in jail for contempt whereas he should have ended up in jail, only if the State in shouldering its responsibility, made an accusation by way of indictment and produced evidence in Court beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.795" offset="4916842">I also wonder as to what role we Lawyers would play in such a situation and I think, most respectfully that Lawyers would be compelled almost to abandon a client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.830" offset="4968982">I can't imagine that a Lawyer would feel at all comfortable with a witness facing this trial on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.438" offset="5003464">Speaking for myself and many others like me, you would be most uncomfortable sitting next to a client knowing that that client has confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.596" offset="5048081">There is one case in this Court that in essence says “A Lawyer who tells his client to cooperate and give up all his rights is in worth his soul”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.129" offset="5094161">I would not feel like I were worth my soul if told a man to give a confession rather than require the State to prove its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.589" offset="5128016">The witness sitting in that chair on the use immunity is sitting and let me call it a “warm chair”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.870" offset="5157169">The chair next to him occupied by the Lawyer is just as warm for the Lawyer indeed it might be very, very warm, it might be hot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.816" offset="5192904">Because the Lawyer would have to be concerned that if his client took the second choice to with perjury, the Lawyer might ultimately be accused of suborning that perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.524" offset="5231774">And if we get down to the third possibility and that is contempt, the Lawyer then really is useless to the client because if the client says to the Lawyer under this situation, I am going to do sometime in jail until the statute of limitations runs out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.924" offset="5297394">There is not anything that the Lawyer can do for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.994" offset="5309619">So, I say for these reasons and many others which I do not have time to elucidate on and hopefully some of the other Lawyers who appear in the cases will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.897" offset="5345250">That transactional immunity as it presently stands should remain, that use immunity is very, very foreign to our system of justice and will work such hazards, and will work such injustices as time will prove if it ever comes to be.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew F. Phelan</label>
            <text syncTime="1342.715" offset="5444516">Mr. Chief Justice, and may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.307" offset="5458935">It is the appellant's contention here this morning that he has been incarcerated on the New Jersey State Commission of Investigation, the immunity statute, and he has been in constituted, incarcerated under a provision which is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.218" offset="5514524">A long line of cases, this Court have held that an immunity statute maybe valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.277" offset="5542840">I submit to you and my further record will State that the commission statute is and was designed to be a use plus proof statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.858" offset="5577113">It was so designed to attempt to reach a particular problem that existed in the State of New Jersey in the period of Spring of 1968, and was so found to exist by a joint legislative committee of the assembly of that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.435" offset="5635418">Now, the statute itself recognizes that in order for a immunity statute to supplant the privilege under the Fifth Amendment that it must be co-extensive with the privilege which it seeks to supplant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.717" offset="5688604">It must never put the individual in a situation in which he would be in worst position than had he exercised his privilege or been allowed to exercise his privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.937" offset="5729459">Now, we contend that this statute does just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.906" offset="5741267">The Fifth Amendment says “No man shall be compelled in a criminal case to be a witness against himself”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.727" offset="5768643">Our statute provides after appropriate steps of Due Process within the commission or within the State process, that individual shall not have any of the testimony or the evidence or evidence derived there from used against him in any criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.125" offset="5834158">We submit that under these circumstances, the individual is in exactly the same position as he was had he not been granted the immunity following his claim of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.965" offset="5881596">Now, since, course Counsel in 1892, which considered a pure use statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.699" offset="5916496">I, for the record and the commission for the record and I feel state would certainly admit that a pure use statute alone which did not protect against the use of derivative evidence must be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.516" offset="5971771">It completely challenges the logic and reason to be able to say that you can compel a man to answer and then go out and secure evidence on the basis of that answer, and use that against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.636" offset="6016284">By the same token in the Brown decision some four years later, the transactional immunity statute or the absolute immunity statute, which I believe flowed from Counselmen and perhaps at a time when we were not considering the middle ground, that absolute immunity statute was upheld and that granted I submit a much broader immunity, that which the Fifth Amendment does require.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.979" offset="6109593">I submit also that it when utilized, it grants a gratuity to the criminal upon who seeks to exercise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.723" offset="6140627">I further suggest that it does an injustice to the best interest of the people themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.982" offset="6165600">Now, in that middle ground then, we come to the point of just what is it, that the Fifth Amendment will require of an immunity statute in order for it to be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.008" offset="6209694">I suggest that is a use plus proofs, an absolute situation whereby once you compel a man to testify, you may under no circumstances use anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.184" offset="6262462">And, I use that term with great consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.064" offset="6273956">Anything whatsoever that flows there from, for if we have compelled him to give up a very sacred right, self incrimination against self incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.992" offset="6313662">That then the Government must bear the burden and must bear the duty, and a very heavy duty perhaps it should be, to show that nothing has ever been used against that individual in connection with any future prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.439" offset="6363399">Now, I submit that under such a rule of law with the use plus proof statute, tied in with a heavy burden being placed upon the Government that was noted in note 18 of the Murphy decision, that the burden is placed upon the Government to establish independent source of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.931" offset="6437378">That the individual may very well be in a better position than he is today under a transactional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.637" offset="6460261">And I say that for this reason, that under the old Haikey decision in 1913, that the individual must prove as an affirmative defense that that transactional immunity statute has protected him against a subsequent indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.893" offset="6509267">I would submit that under a use immunity or use immunity plus proof statute that the burden here would be on the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2044.171" offset="8250380">There has been developed in this Court a rule of law and a body of law which did not existed that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.117" offset="8274204">And to that, I am referring to the exclusionary rule of law that has been utilized in connection with the Fourth Amendment cases, under unreasonable search and seizures, under electronic eavesdropping, under the Sixth Amendment, under the right to Counsel and coerced confessions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2086.927" offset="8421430">I suggest that in terms of the fact that the information and the protection which might be secured to the individual, of course, that information is always in the hands of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.847" offset="8465107">It was in the hands of the Police Department in Miranda decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2106.122" offset="8498125">And still in our Courts, the judiciary throughout this country has found it capable to be able to protect the right of each and every individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.204" offset="8534488">Now, there are, I would submit to the Court, a number of advantages certainly, to a use plus proofs immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.135" offset="8566253">These I believe, in terms of being able to get at, involved conspiracy cases where you are granting solely, the use plus proofs immunity to an individual will allow us a greater opportunity to inquire and to determine the extent of activities in which this individual has been involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.853" offset="8641067">While at the same time, protecting the interest of the State, perhaps in a future prosecution should that information developed at a later date or in other jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.298" offset="8690909">Now for instance, within the State of New Jersey, we have 21 Counties where we are investigating a certain issue in the southern part of New Jersey, and we seek to secure immunity to an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.013" offset="8733750">It may very well be that under a transactional statute or an absolute statute, we maybe granting an individual immunity, and granting him absolute protection to future whereas at the same time and completely unbenounced to us, Mr. Hogan in New York maybe conducting investigation, while the District Attorney and Mr. Inspector in Philadelphia maybe conducting investigation, relating to the same individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.997" offset="8821626">We have absolutely no way of knowing exactly what these individuals are doing, recognizing the entire spread that conspiracy of organized crime, recognizing that it knows no County lines or International lines for that matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2232.519" offset="9003751">Now if I may just add one thing, I think that under a use plus proof statute, we may very well be for the first time protecting the Defendant who was entitled on the Six Amendment to compulsory process and confrontation of witnesses I suggest this because formerly as United States Attorney, I found that when a person is called as a witness by the Defense, and that individual likes to claim his privilege, the Government is effectively precluded from securing that evidence because the only thing we could grant him would be absolute or transaction immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.008" offset="9137707">That fact deprives that Defendant of the right to confront that witness and the right to at least examine on the basis of what he contends is his Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.335" offset="9187027">That situation can be corrected with the use plus proofs immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.518" offset="9203745">And we will be for the first time realistic, extending the Defendant his right of compulsory self process and confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.637" offset="9236241">I will be doing that because then the United States Attorney cannot contend nor could any other prosecuted contend realistically that we cannot grant him transactional immunity because of the fact that we will be giving him absolute protection in the future, I submit to you that this in itself maybe the most important issue that we have under the use plus proofs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2321.951" offset="9361524">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.636" offset="9376258">I appear here as amicus to support the position of the Appellee, State Crime Investigation Commission of New Jersey and the 24 States join in views expressed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.330" offset="9431010">It should be noted that the States still bear the primary responsibility for enforcement of the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.619" offset="9460163">Most crimes are certainly matters of local concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.285" offset="9478867">These immunity statutes have been extremely important part of our rights in fighting crime particularly, organized crime and official corruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.823" offset="9524947">One of the most important powers of any Government in preventing the infiltration of crime in that Government is the power to compel citizens to testify in Court before Grand Jury or Agencies such as the State Crime Investigation Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.923" offset="9589417">On the other hand, we recognized that one of the most important privileges of any citizen is the Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.750" offset="9628705">Obviously, there must be a balance struck between the power on the one hand and compel a witness to testify in Court, and the privilege on the other that anything he says may not be use against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.377" offset="9695160">It seems to me that the-- of course, it all started in Counselmen and whether you read that case as I do, merely holding that the statute in that case was defective because it did not provide proofs immunity in addition to use immunity, certainly, it must be said in all candor that as a result of the equivocal language in that case and the decision of Brown versus Walker case right after it, in which four Justices dissenting and indeed said that no immunity statutes are constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.861" offset="9837162">There arose in the law and in the cases from this Court a many statements to the effect that transactional immunity was the only viable way to compel a witness to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.180" offset="9894422">I think the first crack in the dyke if I may respectfully suggest it came in the three cases of Garidi, Gardener and the Sanitation Workers case, and these cases have been tremendously helpful to the States in official corruption and indeed in calling before official bodies or just the boss themselves in a particular community and requiring public officials under duress of losing their jobs, explaining any particular criminal conduct that might come to the attention of the authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.853" offset="10037051">This Court has held I believe and has stated that only use plus proofs immunity is necessary as a result of any testimony they give and indeed if they refused to explain their activities, they maybe fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.930" offset="10097446">The next crack in the dike, if the Court please, I would say in the unanimous decision of Murphy versus the Waterfront Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.658" offset="10148333">Personally, I fail to take the intellectual step of differentiating the rule in Murphy which applies inter-jurisdictionally, differentiate that from most cases which would indicate a different rule as required in Traft jurisdictionally and that is in the case where this compelling state also is prosecuting state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.524" offset="10263794">To answer the question of Mr. Justice White, I think, they are very practical considerations of the States that are faced within, this very case and Zicarelli, we had at least five indictments and maybe six, I am not sure and three of them have been already tried and he has been convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.628" offset="10328160">At the time, the SCI called him before them and I have no doubt that the SCI would have gone into the matters contained in those indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.281" offset="10374762">But we had clearly intendant evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.083" offset="10386047">We were not worried about prosecuting Zicarelli on those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.545" offset="10399840">We probed them under any test, we could prove that our evidence was independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.450" offset="10423454">However, we would felt much more comforted as it has been if we were sure of our position that use plus proofs has been constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.552" offset="10463892">As the statute provides, I have to say to the Court that even though we have had a use plus proofs immunity statute for sometime in several sectors of New Jersey, we have used it generally for the reason that we were certainly weren't sure of what constitutional ramifications were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.747" offset="10548633">Under the scheme of things, the legislature has ordained that there shall be a State Crime Investigation Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.386" offset="10571203">In my opinion, it was absolutely necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.118" offset="10582174">They did not make the Attorney General counsel for that commission, they said in fact the State Crime Investigation Commission can go out and get a compelled testimony by a Court order without the permission of the Attorney General, to be sure, they must get me 24 hours notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.632" offset="10652182">Indeed in a very relevant investigation of theirs, they could conceivably destroy already made prosecution of ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.948" offset="10693456">In New Jersey, the witness immunity statute intra-jurisdictionally, that is the Federal versus the State has been extremely affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.244" offset="10730654">And in many cases in which the Federal Government has recently got indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.162" offset="10750298">Unfortunately, we have run a file of each other in several instances and some of the cases that we have ready to go to trial may have been affected by that prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.911" offset="10797319">Now, I suggest to you that most all of the States have little systems of Federalism, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2687.743" offset="10824695">With the exemption of Rhode Island in Delaware where all the prosecution is done at one level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.134" offset="10846220">Certainly, New Jersey has 21 County Prosecutors, the Attorney General’s Office, and the SCI and also that Cities are empowered to conduct investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.733" offset="10888643">With 450 some Police forces, it is very difficult to keep from stepping on each other’s toes with all kinds of cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.507" offset="10923751">And therefore, if indeed use plus proofs immunity is constitutionally sound then it seems to me, that is the practical way to have the States and local Government retain their respective rights to use this very, very powerful weapon of witness immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.160" offset="11010373">There seems to be a feeling that the States cannot handle this immunity statute that is too rich for the law that inadvertently or deliberately compelled testimony will be misused in some way because of the closed cooperation among the various Law Enforcement Agencies in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.202" offset="11122491">I say to this Court that I believe the States can use it effectively and constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.872" offset="11149136">I think, for instance, the Picarelli case is a splendid example of effective use of the witness immunity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.257" offset="11186752">In that cases as the Court knows, the individual had pled guilty to beating somebody with a tire arm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.760" offset="11224682">The Prosecution Authorities want to find out whether he was hired to do so, and they called the man before that Court having all ready sufficient and dependent evidence to prosecute him as to matter of fact, he had pled guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.554" offset="11279853">And, they did so and he did indicate that he has been hired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.450" offset="11295526">Unfortunately, he then disclosed individual that hire him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.208" offset="11310468">But he could had and it would have been effective use and there is no reason under the constitution that he should he not have been prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.512" offset="11347771">I believe that a simple task in handling this weapon in this day, whenever you want indeed has Counsel, unlike in the days of Counsel Man and the liberal discovery rules in all jurisdiction neither constitutionally required or by rule of Court, I believe that the Defense Counsel and will they clear record of what is been compel can sort out whether or not your convicting a man from his own lips or the proof’s thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.425" offset="11499386">Now, I believe that the test should be the burden of beyond the State, and that—the test should be that if the Defendant had remain in silence, he would not of been indicted or not had been convicted as the case might do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.840" offset="11569080">This task was originally suggested in Counsel, and I believe that is a sound task and I believe the Courts can handle it without violating anybody’s constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.236" offset="11614638">I urge this Court to overrule Counsel Man if necessarily, and stick with the doctrine of the Murphy case and apply it inter jurisdictionally and I think in that way, we will have much more effective Law Enforcement and indeed Constitutional Law Enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.075" offset="11686004">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2909.476" offset="11711604">Chief Justice, I would like to respond just for a few moment as if I have not left to of what you think that Mr. Phelan said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.916" offset="11737309">Mr. Justice White asked Mr. Phelan or whether or not indeed the State of New Jersey wanted to retain the right to prosecute the man who was called about the very matters about what he was questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.694" offset="11784434">And Mr. Phelan said to the Court that his commission had no prosecutorial responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.337" offset="11815049">While that is true, it is also true under their statute that they are obliged to disseminate the information which they obtained from question for the local Prosecutors who are 21 in number, for the State Attorney General’s Office, and to the Federal Authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.448" offset="11875444">In short, anybody who might be able to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.777" offset="11896760">Mr. Phelan indicated that this statute comes in handy and discovering evidence with respect to large scale conspiracies assume that to be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.475" offset="11947542">I do believe that it is asking for anything to give a man immunity from prosecution, that he helps you to solve a large scale conspiracy case, and gives testimony against seven, eight, nine, 10 or more co-defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.490" offset="12015670">Done everyday, prosecutors like to do it, and it would just actually be a continuation of that situation.</text>
