            <text syncTime="30.498" offset="196015">Certiorari was granted in this case to review the decision of the Florida Supreme Court which held four to three that the right to counsel extends only to those cases which carry a maximum punishment in excess of six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.893" offset="253588">The petitioner in this case John Richard Argersinger who is convicted in the Leon County Court, in Tallahassee, Florida on a charge of carrying a concealed weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.000" offset="290055">The maximum punishment imposable on that charge was six months imprisonment or a fine of $1,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.170" offset="322656">Because the maximum punishment imposable was only six months, the Florida Supreme Court held that Argersinger was not entitled to have been advised of his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.912" offset="361631">Three dissenters in the Florida Supreme Court would have held that the right to counsel extends to any offense in which a man may loose his liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.392" offset="399561">Our position is essentially that.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.587" offset="408338">Our position is that wherever the actual threat of incarceration exists, a man must be advised of his right to counsel and counsel must be appointed for him, if he cannot afford afford counsel, unless the defendant knowingly and intelligently waives that right.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.389" offset="971538">I think that he has the option to waive the right to counsel that point if the court has explained to him the circumstances that exist, the real threat that he may go to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.903" offset="1009677">I do think he can in effect have his cake and eat it too and say now you tried me, now I am going to take this trial because I know you cannot incarcerate me.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.769" offset="1045099">I think that he has to make a decision between one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.112" offset="1058473">I think if he failed to make that decision, and if he stood on that first trial, I do think the decision will be able to be reviewed.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.022" offset="1286157">In that very instance I think the Judge might be left with the fact that he will not be able to impose incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.051" offset="1310189">If there has been a clear situation originally where the man did request counsel and the Judge had made up his mind there would be no imprisonment, I think that is a rare case though.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.065" offset="1346238">I think that what happens in most of these cases --</text>

            <label>Mr. Bruce S. Rogow</label>
            <text syncTime="329.091" offset="1390437">I do not think it would be rare, Your Honor because I think that in very few of these relatively minor offenses and I mean, very minor offenses, for instance violations in the City of New York which carry a maximum penalty of 15 days, very can people actually go to jail in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.398" offset="1451564">A statistic contained in our brief at page 40 shows that over million eight hundred thousand people were tried in New York on these minor violations and only 40 were actually incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.231" offset="1490957">So I think there really is some practical recognition made everyday in every Court in the Country that some offenses, although they carry the possibility because the ordinance says 15 days, there is no real actual possibility have incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.045" offset="1554173">Our position is essentially drawn from the long line of cases beginning with Powell versus Alabama through Johnson versus Zerbst, Gideon versus Wainright, In re Gault, and Coleman versus Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.913" offset="1601716">In this long line of cases the Court has consistently held that the right to counsel is fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.722" offset="1620942">It is essential to the fact finding process and a fair trial cannot be held without the guiding hand of counsel of every point.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.608" offset="1652498">As the Court said in Gideon in our advisory system of criminal justice, any person held into court who is too poor to higher lawyer cannot be assured a fair trial, unless counsel was provided for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.888" offset="1697533">We submit that those words in Gideon are equally applicable to a case where man may lose his liberty for even one day.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.919" offset="1729716">Several courts had held that there is no distinction to be drawn by the constitution between loss of liberty for a long period of time and loss of liberty for a short period.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.288" offset="1763153">Nearly 30 years ago, in Evans versus Reeves, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.577" offset="1784364">The constitution draws as no distinction between loss of liberty for a long time and short time.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.780" offset="1805157">United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has held in every case that has come before it that the right to counsel extended to the indigent misdemeanant or traffic violator who has faced with as in each case there was presented in the Fifth Circuit, 90 days, that in each of those cases the right to counsel extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.359" offset="1875479">There is no real hard and fast rule though in the Fifth Circuit because the Fifth Circuit decisions have been on a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.777" offset="1901079">In one case James versus Headley, Judge Wisdom writing for himself alone, urged the position that we urge here today that anytime there is an actual threat of incarceration, a person should be provided a counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.723" offset="1948935">That position is supported by the ABA Committee on minimum standards for criminal justice which urges a very similar position almost exactly like ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.804" offset="1985193">The President's Commission on Crime and law enforcement has urged a similar position.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.034" offset="2006196">So the position that we submit to the court today is not one that is not been recognized even judicially or by established committees of the bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="557.437" offset="2303783">The difficulty is it has to be sort of a pre-judgment and this Court is acknowledge that kind of judgment in the criminal content cases dealing with right to a jury trial where if a decision is made by the presiding judge that this defendant may get more than six months, there has to be jury trial provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.950" offset="2373791">There are faults in this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.638" offset="2388524">I would prefer I think a flat out rule that anytime a person faces even a remotest possibility of incarceration he should be provided counsel, but the rule we advance and the rule that it is supported by the Solicitor General takes into consideration the practical aspects of what goes on everyday in a low visibility of the criminal justice system and that is at many minor offenders sidewalks splitters, jay walkers these are always a kind of offenses that raised in the decisions which seek to limit the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.538" offset="2496148">Those people do not actually face the threat of incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.220" offset="2510882">Of course, under the ordinance they may, but it is such a remote possibility, we submit that the real threat of incarceration does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.683" offset="2548707">Only 10 States still adhere to a firm and inflexible rule that the right to counsel extends only to felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.656" offset="2576606">The other States have all moved beyond the Gideon versus Wainright decision in one form or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.892" offset="2601579">Not all of them do what Minnesota as done in State versus Borst and say that if imprisonment is likely to be imposed then the court must appoint counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.947" offset="2637837">Several other States have adapted the same position not always on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.999" offset="2654033">The Minnesota decision was based upon the rule making power of that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.467" offset="2667930">New Jersey in Rodriguez versus Rosenblatt arrived at the same conclusion based upon its own laws, but what is important to looking at the States is that they have moved into the field of providing counsel for misdemeanors and there is no great fear on the part of the States, that providing such counsel would cause them any great harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.228" offset="2742953">The arguments that had been advanced in limiting the right to counsel to an access of six month cases are based upon one or several of the following theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.235" offset="2779002">First that because the right to counsel and the right to jury trial both reside in the Sixth Amendment, the right to counsel must be governed by this court's decision in a jury trial case, Baldwin versus New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.486" offset="2823933">We submit that, that argument is just not valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.377" offset="2835531">There is a great difference between counsel and a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.952" offset="2849846">As the Court recognized in Baldwin a fair trial can be had without a jury and in fact everyday in this country fair trials are had without a jury by a judge alone, but a lawyer is essential to the fact finding process and the lawyer must be there to hammer out the facts which the decider will have to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.678" offset="2924766">Therefore, analogy between jury trial and counsel is not valid and one other reason, I think this Court is recognized that the analogy is invalid in holding the right to counsel retroactive, but in refusing to hold the right to a jury trial retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.371" offset="2983489">Another argument advanced in the cases which seek to limit the right to counsel is that because the right to counsel in jury trial both reside in the Sixth Amendment, Baldwin versus New York must govern, but there are other rights in the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.946" offset="3033853">There is a right to a public trial, the right to a speedy trial, the right to confront the witnesses against you, the right to compulsory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.938" offset="3061752">No court has ever held to my knowledge that those rights are contingent upon a sentence which exceeds six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.007" offset="3090068">So any argument that because all these right reside in the same amendment, they are govern by Baldwin versus New York, just does not hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.661" offset="3136671">Another argument advanced by people seeking to limit the right to counsel is that the criminal Justice at Title 18 US Code, Section 3068 at present which is the Federal Standard for appointed counsel, limits appointed counsel only to cases which exceeds six months, but that law relates only to the payment of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.604" offset="3220472">It does not set a firm rule that counsel shall not be provided in so called petty offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.689" offset="3248788">In fact to the contrary, the framers of the law, the legislative history compel the -- support the conclusion that they believed that the right to counsel did extend to petty offenses and they left the Criminal Justice Act open ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.156" offset="3298630">So the counsel will be able to be paid, if this Court holds that the right to counsel does extend beyond or into -- in cases that hold -- that carry less than six month penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.054" offset="6658291">Mr. Chief Justice and may it pleas the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.355" offset="6671456">Perhaps I am too unreconstructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.057" offset="6686294">What I plan to do here is to think of the legal problem in this case in terms of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment, rather in terms of the right to counsel provision in the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.318" offset="6743345">This is a State case and if the Sixth Amendment is applicable, it is true of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.480" offset="6779917">As far as the Sixth Amendment alone is concerned, there are in some minds at least, some verbal or doctrinal difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.109" offset="6822444">By its language, the Sixth Amendment guarantee is only the right to have counsel and not the right to have counsel supplied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.321" offset="6859329">I know that the contrary was decided in the Gideon case and that this was set to rest on the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.820" offset="6893288">For some though this has a more understandable foundation in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.382" offset="6919515">Then there is the fact that the Sixth Amendment by it terms is applicable in all criminal prosecutions and the Court has decided in the Duncan and Baldwin that the right to a jury trial also provided by the Sixth Amendment is applicable where the penalty is more than six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.082" offset="7010317">On this basis, it is contended as it was decided below that the right to counsel provision can be applicable only where more than six months imprisonment is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.872" offset="7065487">Of course they are authorities who are saying that the same words in a statute or constitution may have different meanings and different applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.189" offset="7106761">This involves that some intellectual strain, but as I have said it's easier for me to deal with the problem in terms of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.402" offset="7147616">After all it is a case of procedural due process which lies at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.297" offset="7179172">And two, we are more accustomed to think of due process as a developing idea then we are define such flexibility in some of the earlier amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.236" offset="7230999">On this basis, I look at the Gideon case which with respect it seems to me to have a fairly sound due process foundation in considering the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.775" offset="7289095">I cannot find any basis, any logical ground to stand on for saying that the right to counsel exists for imprisonment of six months or more, but does not apply for imprisonment for less than six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.257" offset="7358999">I recognize that lines have to be drawn on the law like the age of majority and that my case is close to the line on each side will not be very different from each others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.309" offset="7407273">However, with respect to imprisonment I find it hard to draw a line in any place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.386" offset="7431619">Five months imprisonment seems to me to be substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.135" offset="7450532">I do not find much help when the time is reduced to ten days or five days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.691" offset="7476759">There seems to me to be a difference in kind between the imprisonment of any duration and merely monetary sanctions or other sanctions which maybe imposed by judicial decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.066" offset="7538304">These other sanctions maybe a serious burden, but they do not keep involve depriving a person of his liberty and that is something fundamental in our society and thus I have found myself forced to the conclusion that there should be a due process right to counsel and that this right should be applicable, before any term of imprisonment can be imposed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1905.221" offset="7694934">Any imprisonment at all is the only place where I can find a satisfactory place to draw the line, drawing a distinction between imprisonment and monetary penalties of one kind or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.638" offset="7756583">Obviously there are problems at the boarder line, as the case is mentioned by my associate here where a statute authorizes imprisonment but it is rarely imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.836" offset="7813321">I should think that in such cases the prosecutor or judge should make the determination in advance or if something develops at the trial which makes imprisonment seem appropriate, and the defendant has not had counsel, whether he had waived it or not before that without a clear understanding that imprisonment was a likely consequence, there should at the defendant's request be a new trial or a counsel will be provided and very likely before a different judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.042" offset="7942157">If in answer to Chief Justice's question, he says well I stand on that trial, I take it that to be waiver of his right to counsel but he should have a right to have counsel at a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.288" offset="7987192">If he does not want it, it should be forced on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.627" offset="8004537">This conclusion that counsel should be made available for an indigent defendant before any term of imprisonment is imposed is essentially the conclusion which has been reached by two eminent bodies which have considered this problem not as judges, but as persons vitally interested in developing proper standards for the administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.039" offset="8098160">These are the American Bar Association and it is minimum standards for criminal justice and the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.136" offset="8146539">Both are cited on page 17 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.916" offset="8161690">The Bar Association recommendation on this matter has in substance been approved at least three times by the House of Delegates of the Association which is a large and representative group of the profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.700" offset="8224802">Because of these reports and actions, I have more confidence in the conclusion to which I have felt myself compelled as an intellectual matter, and namely that counsel must be made available to an indigent before any sentence of imprisonment can be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.467" offset="8295855">I am also confirmed by the excellent opinion of Justice Jacobs of the Supreme Court of New Jersey for an unanimous court in Rodriguez against Rosenblatt decided last May.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.293" offset="8359175">At this point though another extremely difficult problem arises.</text>

            <text syncTime="2112.514" offset="8524060">Although our information about the manpower situation is sketchy, what we have is encouraging.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.642" offset="8552586">As far as the Federal Courts are concerned, a counsel is now required in all cases unless it is waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.945" offset="8585814">That's Rule 44A of the Rules -- Federals Rules of Civil Procedure and I say the same is applicable with respect to trials in the magistrate's courts because any defendant there may elect to have a trial in the District Court where he can have counsel assigned to him if he chooses in order to save time and to get it over with which I think is often situation in these new cases to go ahead in the magistrate's court, he has had the right to go to the District Court and have counsel and I find it not too difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.765" offset="8721128">Moreover it seems to me not unlikely that counsel can be provided in the magistrate's courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.500" offset="8752057">The latest amendment of the Criminal Justice Act provides for compensation for counsel in these cases because it's now been amended to say wherever it is required by the constitution and if this Court so decides, then it will be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.427" offset="8815691">All cases involving any imprisonment have long been covered in the District of Columbia, where there are of course many petty offenses and this is not proved to be unbarred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.963" offset="8869922">As far as the situations in the States is concerned there is more room for concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.592" offset="8904403">However, the problems will probably not be as serious in actuality as the statistics on the number of cases would indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.438" offset="8947766">In the first place it appears that merely half of the States now cover all or nearly all of these cases and to that extent, to the extent that increases in services are required, there all figures need to be adjusted because it undoubtedly is true that it takes less time to try most misdemeanors than it does the more serious cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.449" offset="9051838">Moreover, it is likely that the counsel will be waived more often in cases of petty offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.234" offset="9074931">And it seems to me that waivers might well be more readily accepted in cases of this sort and where the charge is a bit of serious felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.681" offset="9108785">If the defendant in response to inquiry from the Court says he does not want counsel, it should not be forced when the right to counsel and usefulness of counsel are somewhat attenuated as they are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.881" offset="9177539">We have considerable light on all of these questions in the two briefs of amicus curie which have been filed in this case on behalf of the Legal Age Society of New York which sets out actual experience in a situation where counsel are required in the cases of this sort in our most congested metropolitan area, and the National Legal Aid and Defenders Association and as has been said much the same information is contained in an article in the recent issue of the William and Mary Law Review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.901" offset="9345664">New York has for sometime provided for representation in cases where imprisonment maybe opposed -- imposed and the New York Legal Aid Society shows that the load can be handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.094" offset="9414418">So maybe other brief in the Article summarize experience in other places which indicates that the load though substantial is not unmanageable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.599" offset="9464468">On the basis of this information and experience, I find myself led to the conclusion that the chances are that the adoption by this Court of a rule that counsel must be furnished before any imprisonment maybe imposed would result in increasing the man hours required of the defense counsel by a 50 or 60%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.915" offset="9557673">This is a serious matter that I do not think that it is insuperable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.718" offset="9584945">I have tried to put together some figures but they are much too uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.115" offset="9610441">On the basis of those figures I estimate that it is perhaps as many as 3,000 additional lawyers would required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.383" offset="9647535">At $10,000 a year that would be a cost of 30 million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.598" offset="9664462">If you add half of that for secretarial and other personnel, it might get up to as much as 50 Million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.007" offset="9702078">Whatever that financial load, this should be manageable when allocated to the 50 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.179" offset="9730708">Even though some of the larger States would have to carry a considerable part of the load.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.826" offset="9753278">That California and Illinois and New York now provide for counsel in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.554" offset="9780237">Thus a considerable part of the additional load is already undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.667" offset="9800717">Other States should now be guided to do likewise just as was the situation when the Gideon case itself was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.474" offset="9843871">In this connection with respect to the availability of lawyers to carry the task, I am encouraged by the presently existing fact that there are now twice as many students in the nation's law schools as they were ten years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.154" offset="9914611">That young lawyers are starting their practice in unprecedented numbers and that it is estimated that the number of lawyers in the country will double within the next 12 or 13 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.966" offset="9969886">Already concern is being expressed about the openings which will be available for these new lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.836" offset="9997366">It maybe that the recognition of the need and the availability of the means to answer are about to coincide.</text>

            <text syncTime="3037.053" offset="12222268">It seems to me that it would be very helpful if this Court's decision could make a plain that under a appropriate circumstances, the right to counsel does not require the presence of a fully qualified member of the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.151" offset="12274617">For example, many of these cases might be handled very effectively by law students under proper supervision and it would be helpful if this court's decision could recognize that possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.871" offset="12321533">I have been familiar with the activities of law students in court and I would say from experience that they provide excellent service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.865" offset="12353507">Usually they have much more time available than practicing lawyers and they work on their cases with great energy and enthusiasm and it might also be that other persons could serve as counsel in certain types of cases, involving relatively small sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.129" offset="12410558">These might include clergymen, social workers, probation officers and other persons of that type and finally I have great concern about the more rural areas in the country, Wyoming, Idaho or North Dakota, or Upstate New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.143" offset="12478581">There may well be cases of family assaults where a short jail sentence is appropriate and where there is no lawyer within a 100 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.333" offset="12511391">In such cases it seems to me that real need might be met by the parents on behalf of the defendant of a minister or parent or a probation officer or some other local citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.953" offset="12561859">Often what is needed in cases of this sort is not legal expertise, but simply an assurance that there is not over reaching of some sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.506" offset="12599998">I would hope that this court's decision might leave some flexibility so that cases in remote areas involving relatively minor penalties might be handled with some sort of appropriate representation other than that of fully qualified legal counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.992" offset="12666036">This seems to me to be adequately consistent with the due process concept in cases where the requirement of counsel is clearly stretched close to its limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.762" offset="12713056">On this basis I submit that the decision below should be reversed within the appropriately flexible opinion of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="4465.587" offset="17936397">There really is not much disagreement between my brother Mr. Georgieff and myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4471.111" offset="17958444">As he said in his argument there is no real horrible prospect here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4475.284" offset="17975162">He mentioned several matters that he thought might cause problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.637" offset="17992612">In fact, in his brief on Page 17 the Attorney General of the State of Florida is suggesting a Betts versus Brady rule they are not the same in anyway, that is should be no right to counsel in these misdemeanor offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4491.975" offset="18041931">They have suggested Betts versus Brady on page 17 and we submit that Betts versus Brady was rejected in Gideon versus Wainright.</text>
            <text syncTime="4500.616" offset="18076517">One problem that does concern me in this case and that is in seeking to assure that a decision be reached which will limit the future litigation in terms of on a case by case basis trying to decide whether there was a violation or whether there wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4516.522" offset="18140152">I think that the waiver of counsel must be set forth clearly in any decision this Court reaches, set forth in such a way so that it is clear that the trial court will advise the defendant not just it has a right to counsel, right to appoint a counsel but advise the defendant that trial judge has concluded that there is a real actual threat of incarceration and only in that kind of situation could defend and make a knowing and intelligent waiver on the Johnson versus Zerbst as of his right to counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="4555.809" offset="18297304">I think it would have to be clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4559.441" offset="18311828">Our position is if the Supreme Court of Florida should be reversed the case should be reminded Argersinger and all of the persons who face actual threat of Incarceration should be advised and provided counsel unless they knowingly and intelligently waive that right, waive it knowingly and intelligently waived that right.</text>
