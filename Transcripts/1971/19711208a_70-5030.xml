            <text syncTime="1089.718" offset="4432539">That is a good point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.275" offset="4450825">With regard to the vagueness point, we think that the merit was capsulized very well by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in his dissenting opinion in Winters versus New York in 1940 something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.095" offset="4502025">He there pointed out that this type of legislation falls in the unique category that -- it is perfectly designed to be vague, purposely designed to be open, and it is significance that Mr. Justice Frankfurter did that and it is further significant that he did it in the circumstances in which he did because he was there dissenting from a majority holding that legislation was unconstitutionally vague and he had catalogued the reasons why the Court should be very hesitant to declare a legislation unconstitutionally vague and he specified as an exception the area of vagrancy in which he said within a unique category, by itself it was egregiously bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.824" offset="4660954">In addition to the problem of lack of notice to affected persons we also have a problem that is presented by lack of some sort of enforcement standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.327" offset="4691047">There is no way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.093" offset="4694077">And the police officer or jury and municipal judge or anybody else could know what is intended at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.803" offset="4712885">And this in and of itself and by -- stand unless a discriminatory enforcement especially when we have legislation of the ultimate -- sort of that we have here that can be directed and applied to unconventional or unpopular or unestablished people of the sort -- quite of these anyway from people who are or not willing to be broadminded than others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.657" offset="4800343">Apparently the legislation, because of its breadth and broadness, necessarily must restrict people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.569" offset="4823958">In the attempted exercise and the desired exercise, the rights that are preserved to them without question about the constitution, certainly the right of travel is drawn into question by the provision against wandering from place to place for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.459" offset="4887487">And we have enumerated others in our brief with the suggestion how they might be similarly effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.141" offset="4914237">Apart from that contention, we also contend under a broad grouping that we called abuse of police power that the ordinance is constitutionally invalid in other respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.035" offset="4965855">We contend first that insofar as it relates to people who are in the category of Mr. Justice Brennan spoke off living on the earnings of their wives and so on that it invades the zone of privacy that was thought to be secured by Griswold versus Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.132" offset="5042237">Further even in the part of the ordinance which deals with thieves and gamblers and what have you which might be outside that area, the legislation is still overbroad because of the completeness of its application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.893" offset="5105244">The point that Mr. Justice Stewart was speaking of where it can be applied recurrently over and over again against one individual, so that he becomes permanently an outcast and permanently subject to incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.353" offset="5151115">In this regard, it is significant to note that the only justification offered for that kind of breadth and scope by the City of Jacksonville its prime control and it is significant that they are ample prime control methods available to the City of Jacksonville or the State of Florida that can accomplish the same purposes that this legislation can accomplish without nearly the oppression to human and individual rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.238" offset="5270651">We say also as a third major point and related to the abuse of police power, that really, the legislation is no more than a legislative declaration that some people are suspicious per se, that some people are tending the crime per se and if they must be suppressed at the outset, he independently of any act or an issue on that part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.175" offset="5354348">This is actually borne out by the social history of the legislation by the contention that is made by the City expressed in its brief and by the history of application well documented by boards such as the President’s commission on law enforcement and the American Bar Association’s Foundation For Criminal Justice which have all found that the legislation is used primarily for the arrest of people on suspicion only when police officers require or make ways and they cannot find anything else to use -- its grounds for an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.547" offset="5523935">But we say that this pattern in tradition of use, has become inevitable part of the statute and in fact, it has resulted because it was built into the statutes or into the ordinance in the first the instance and it would only be inevitable result -- and will continue unless the legislation is now struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.399" offset="5595301">I would like to reserve the remainder of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1732.086" offset="7002047">But let me, if I may say how this case got here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.640" offset="7044261">We have a very fine judge on our Circuit Court bench that reviewed this case when it was brought over to him from the Municipal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.268" offset="7078743">The only thing that he was permitted to consider was the constitutionality of the statute on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.529" offset="7111762">Then it went to the District Court of Appeals and in the petitioner’s brief the only thing he asked for was that they consider the constitutionality of the statute on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.239" offset="7158678">At no place did the Florida Court get to look at these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.546" offset="7179889">I will be candid with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.692" offset="7188457">They have made allegations here that they are not even under the ordinance and should have been reversed and the first appellate step in the Florida Appellate Structure should have been permitted and would have in my opinion directed the Municipal Court to straighten that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.812" offset="7248957">There were no prosecutors in this Court at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.697" offset="7260451">And they go in and it is an unfortunate situation that a Municipal Courts run the way they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.200" offset="7282498">But Mr. Jacobson makes a big thing out of 900 and some vagrancy arrests this year, we have 550,000 people in our community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.631" offset="7312173">That is approximately three a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.957" offset="7321473">And let me point out that in the State of Florida, you cannot make an arrest for many, many of the things that are mentioned in the statute unless they are permitted in the presence of the officer, only authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.191" offset="7370478">If it is a misdemeanor or the violation of Municipal Ordinance, if the officer is 30 seconds late, he is required to go around to a magistrate and get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.117" offset="7402139">So, he does use this and then the vagrancy ordinance and then the charge is changed as is often the case in the administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.059" offset="7449891">So out of the approximately three arrests a day, many of them, on the docket, you see, the next morning they would be changed although the arrest was vagrancy because he was 30 seconds late in getting to the same where he was been abroad with the evidence obvious and the people giving the officer good grounds to make an arrest except he just does not have time to get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.068" offset="7537976">And it is a very practical necessary ordinance for the maintenance of public order in Jacksonville, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.252" offset="7566710">Just because it is old, stipulating that the legislature should strike some of the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.013" offset="7605789">Just because it is old, would not necessarily seem to be grounds for reversing it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2319.943" offset="9353486">That was the Court that entered the judgment, the District Court of Appeals merely commented that the statute was constitutional but denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.786" offset="9388803">So that is not a judgment and he should have gone from here -- since he came from the wrong Court and Justice Holmes says that is fake, as we cited that in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.189" offset="9450452">I would like to submit to the Court and in this brief time, we certainly cannot go into a deep alluded philosophical discussion but as old as this statute is, it is archaic, as some of the language is the very important law enforcement tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.488" offset="9531641">It goes to the very heart of police power of our municipality and to the police power of the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.367" offset="9559122">And if it needs to be revised this Court has time after time spoken of the fact that it will not strike a statute if it can be construed to be constitutional but it must be beyond any reasonable doubt unconstitutional and the fact that some archaic language in a statute does not make it unconstitutional in its total situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.099" offset="9666119">This court has in fact held that it has a duty to uphold the police power measure, if it bears some rational relationship to health, safety, morals or general welfare and the means employed reasonably accomplishes the desired result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.322" offset="9746994">The means here were probably an unconstitutional application of a statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2498.168" offset="10066315">The guidelines laid down in Roth for example, and cited in our brief, the reasonable speed of many words that just defy strict definition and as Justice frankfurter pointed out on a number of occasions that this balance between the maintenance of public order and criminal conduct and drawing words and language broad enough to protect the public and narrow enough to protect the individual is what it is all about and it is really -- there is no handbook on legislative drafting that this will be constitutional and this would be not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.270" offset="10250740">This is a tremendously complex difficult area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.472" offset="10263592">And so I will simply submit it on the fact that it is not unconstitutionally vague in view of the many words, that this Court has held to be constitutional, not constitutionally vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.634" offset="10332242">And our brief cites many illustrations to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.001" offset="10349691">There must be a place on reasonable application of this particular ordinance and phrases within these ordinance where it would be held to be constitutional therefore it cannot be stricken on it face under the laws or under the rules laid down by this Court because in many provisions of it, which saved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.267" offset="10458779">And it is vital to the protection of the public and the corporate city, the consolidated government of the city of Jacksonville.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.308" offset="10502978">I would like to point out that I have read most of the commentaries of Mr. Jacobson, my brother has cited to the Court, I find very little that it is written about the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.196" offset="10578524">I would like to point out that the police departments today in the metropolitan areas such as Jacksonville, Florida are watched by the media, television, news paper, they are watched by the prosecutor, they are watched by the Human Relations Committees, they are watched by the Civil Liberties Union, they are watched by the Sheriff himself because he is the elected official.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.613" offset="10660131">We have one police department in our government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.994" offset="10669639">They are watched by the Executive arm of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.054" offset="10677894">They are watched by the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.289" offset="10686880">If they have come in with bad evidence, if they make any illegal search, their evidence is suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.343" offset="10707047">And the idea that there is hanging over Jacksonville, I noticed that these cases were very selectively brought to your attention that there is hanging over Jacksonville, some threat of the police power taking over or being abused is manifestly not fair to the functions of the police department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.844" offset="10793042">We have a thousand, obviously we are going to get some bad outlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.362" offset="10807148">If you are pouring a personal reference until a week ago, (Inaudible) prosecuted a bad outlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.168" offset="10830345">But to say that they are all bad or that they are abusing their authority perpetually under this particular ordinances is manifestly unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.537" offset="10875798">Tree arrest a day in a city of 550,000 people cannot be a wide, broad use of this statute when you are considering that it is being applied in order that some arrest can be made that could not otherwise be made to protect the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.867" offset="10945179">I respectfully submit Your Honors that the crime rate of the United States has grown up according to the authority cited by Mr. Jacobson, 400% in the last 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.094" offset="11014038">The population has grown up 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.434" offset="11027412">We have not been able to keep abreast of it in our community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.592" offset="11044026">43% according to Mr. Jacobson are people in his authorities are afraid to walk down the streets at night alone in our community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.391" offset="11079239">We need to modernize our ordinances and our statutes to do something to help us and to get the balance back in the administration of criminal justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="2763.995" offset="11129708">I would assume that the people of Florida will elect people who can make those decisions with the advice of the Courts that they will make the decisions or rather or not they can make this type of conduct illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.967" offset="11193551">And that those people that they elect will make the appropriate decision and then if they unconstitutionally have stepped over the bounds of the first ten amendments which Justice Black spoke so eloquently about then they are stricken down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.050" offset="11249871">But if they do not and I submit that there is not a single thing here that steps over the bound of the first Ten Amendments of the constitution of the United States or the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2941.975" offset="11841597">I would like first to respond to some of the explicit statements made by Mr. Austin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.727" offset="11872630">The contention that we are out of Court because the writ has been misdirected that we submit is no more than a cripple -- it is not entitled to any standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.760" offset="11916725">We treated this question at some length in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.542" offset="11931876">The matter was also litigated in connection with the application for a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.311" offset="11950893">If in fact the City is correct that the writ was misdirected, the simple answer would be for the review that this Court makes to be at the Circuit Court order which can well be done and that that is the proper remedy in connection with the application for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.796" offset="12008885">We responded to the city's response by saying that we would be very pleased for the writ to be directed to the Circuit Court instead of to the First District if that was the appropriate choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.090" offset="12054025">We think that it makes a difference with -- it is a difference without a distinction from purposes of these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.781" offset="12084849">I might have lost to understand the city's recurrent citation of the Headley versus Selkowitz language by the Florida Supreme Court that the vagrancy statute is not be used very liberally by Florida law enforcement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.336" offset="12147020">I do not see how that provides any comfort to the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.986" offset="12157678">It seems to me that this is no more than or no less than an expressed statement that law enforcers, that law enforcement officers are not to make any even handed application of the statute but that they are given license and freedom to decide for themselves what the standards of arrest are going to be which to us seems to point out the very vise of the statute was complained about.</text>

            <text syncTime="3122.406" offset="12563308">What would he do for example with persons neglecting all lawful business and habitually spending their time by frequent houses of ill fame, gaming houses or places where alcoholic beverages are sold or served.</text>

            <text syncTime="3144.722" offset="12652542">There is nothing archaic about that language and it is not that the language of the ordinance is archaic, it is said that the thrust, the concept which the ordinance represents is archaic and it is outside the boundaries of what is considered minimal due process or minimal decency by our current standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.378" offset="12731223">Further it is not simply and I want to make this point as emphatically as I can, it is not simply vagueness that we complain about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.231" offset="12762570">As much as that, we complain about the extent and sweep of the statute, not only is it difficult to understand who is within it but when somebody is determined to be within it they are subject to this recurring and constant sort of classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.456" offset="12827563">Our basic complaint is that it is unconstitutional to deal with these matters by status proscriptions of the sort that are had here even if there were some way were found to make the ordinance sufficiently definite to pass vagrants test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.081" offset="12902064">Mr. Austin complains that the City has been brought here without any review on the facts by the Florida system and he says that there was no way that the Florida system could have granted him set review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.135" offset="12954204">On the contrary the Florida Courts could -- if they had one or two, go beyond the relief or the theory of what the petitioners sought down there in the same way that this Court did in Johnson versus Florida and three years ago on a similar vagrancy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.124" offset="13018152">But the Florida Court shows not to and I submit that the reason that it shows not to is that they are not opposed to that they approve the application of the vagrancy concept and the clearest manifestation of that is the way in which the Florida Supreme Court responded when this Court’s order in the Johnson case was sent back to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.905" offset="13105296">The peevish grudging, sort of sarcastic and resentful language of the Florida Supreme Court’s opinion reflects the attitude of the Florida Courts on these questions and unless relief comes from this Court, there is going to be no relief.</text>
