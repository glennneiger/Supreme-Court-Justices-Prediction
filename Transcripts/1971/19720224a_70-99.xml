            <text syncTime="20.966" offset="157538">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.066" offset="189930">The Supreme Court of Indiana in this case rested its decision entirely on the Commerce Clause and declared the ordinance invalid under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.593" offset="252101">It filed the validity there and stated that it did not therefore reach the other constitutional issues in the case that had been decided by the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.416" offset="319393">The Trial Court had decided the ordinance invalid under the constitutional right to travel, the Fourteenth Amendment, Privileges and Immunities Clause and Equal Protection Clause and it also found it invalid under the Indiana Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.727" offset="400581">We contend unconstitutionality under all of these and particularly under the constitutional right to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.202" offset="438511">However since I am seeking affirmance of the Indiana Supreme Court decision, I intend to limit or to rely principally or discuss principally the Commerce Clause decision by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.667" offset="524401">The crucial issue, I submit under the Commerce Clause is whether or not, this is a use tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.775" offset="576751">The case has been argued and I think briefed by the other side on the assumption that it is a use tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.937" offset="617397">The cases it cites, the highway use cases principally are use tax cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.708" offset="652506">It is my submission to this Court that the tax is not a use tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.930" offset="681450">It is not a use charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.088" offset="690018">It is not a service charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.244" offset="698690">Rather it is a charge or a tax on the passenger for the act of enplanement.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.721" offset="736620">That is, it is a charge on the passenger for the act of boarding the aircraft for the purpose of departure 88% of the people who are enplaning at this airport or enplaning for an out of state place.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.003" offset="841737">The question and issue of whether or not this is a use tax has been before the Court’s on four states and it has been present in these cases since these ordinances gained popularity some four years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.140" offset="938286">It has been and was discussed directly before the Trial Court and the Indiana Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.026" offset="969841">In this case, they decided that it was not a use tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.802" offset="988859">It was not a charge for use and that it was dependent solely on the act of enplanement.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.883" offset="1017175">It was before the Montana Supreme Court in a very similar case Except that in the Montana case, the charge was nominally levied on the air carrier rather than on the passenger.</text>

            <text syncTime="433.272" offset="1806805">In arguing the unconstitutionality of this ordinance or of a statute similar to this, I am not contending and I do not want to be misunderstood that there is no way that the Airport Board can increase its income or can make as the other side says can make interstate commerce pay its fair share.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.123" offset="1902204">The case is a liegemen under which states and localities have made interstate commerce pay its fair share.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.983" offset="1937626">They are properly apportioned gross receipts taxes, properly apportioned net income taxes, in this case, we have landing fees, in this case, we have rentals and there are privilege taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="830.072" offset="3394005">Clearly, that is a much harder case and a much different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.345" offset="3411037">Now, on the question of the operating need, Mr. Trockman yesterday stated that the Airport Board had an operating deficit and I do not contest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.514" offset="3483761">I think it might be well to put it in some perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.002" offset="3501734">The total operating income in 1967 of the Board was some $268,900.00.</text>

            <text syncTime="878.440" offset="3587415">That’s about equally from aviation sources and non-aviation sources (Inaudible) that was the total operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.212" offset="3618553">The total operating disbursements exclusive of bond retirement of a $166,000.00 leaving an operating profit exclusive of bond retirement of approximately $100,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.381" offset="3679157">The bond retirement cost was $182,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.601" offset="3696085">Incidentally, this is shown, these figures are taken from paragraph 25 in appendix page 59 and from exhibit 5 to the stipulation of facts which was not printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.357" offset="3763063">The only figure taken from exhibit 5 is the operating disbursements and the breakdown of the income between aviation and non-aviation sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.484" offset="3819592">As I said, the bond retirement costs were $182,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.200" offset="3834534">The operating profit exclusive of the bond retirement was about $100,000.00.</text>

            <text syncTime="1035.545" offset="4215817">Yes, Your Honor, of something less than a $100,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.276" offset="4270779">Coming back to the question of whether or not this is a use tax and therefore a sense governed or controlled by the highway use tax cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.485" offset="4327621">The Indiana Supreme Court responded quite directly to the Airport Board’s argument that this charge is a service charge for the use of facilities and stated that there is no question that the incidence of the tax imposed by Ordinance 33 falls on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.953" offset="4405466">And it also held that the tax is on the active enplanement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.555" offset="4427931">Focused quite squarely on the issue of whether the act of enplanement was reasonably related to the use of airport facilities and held that and I quote that, “it is clear that the tax imposed by Ordinance 33 is not reasonably related to the use of the facilities which benefit from the tax.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.175" offset="4502433">Trial court made similar findings stating that not withstanding the name given the charge nor the stated justification for the charge, its operating incidence is solely on the act of enplanement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.221" offset="4558544">The Trial Court also made findings that the use of the airport by the minority who were taxed was no different in quality or amount than the use by the majority who were not taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.995" offset="4669616">That it does depend on the act of enplanement and not use, I think it is clear from the reading of the ordinance itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.767" offset="4704725">It imposes what is called in the ordinance a use and service charge of $1.00 per each passenger enplaning any commercial aircraft operated from the Dress Memorial Airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.374" offset="4763135">It imposes on the airline the obligation to collect that tax and remit it to the state based on the number of enplaning passengers times the $1.00 charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.580" offset="4831993">The tax as the Trial Court and the Supreme Court noted is not imposed on all users only on a minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.667" offset="4884343">While those findings on the discriminatory nature of the charge form the basis of the Court’s holding in part of the basis of the Court’s holding under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and also its holding of invalidity under the Nevada Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.675" offset="4980369">The arbitrary nature of the charge or selection of passengers –- selection of users who will be charged also formed its basis or partly formed its basis for the finding that it was not a use charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.708" offset="5044526">I submit that the fact that the funds collected under this tax go into the Airport Board funds for the use on the airport does not make this a use tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.030" offset="5145776">It is clearly a relevant consideration for the Court to consider in determining whether or not it is a use tax but it is not decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.994" offset="5201678">And I think that McCarroll against Dixie Greyhound 309 U.S. points that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.498" offset="5235637">The Court there stated that it is not enough that the tax when collected is expended upon the state’s highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.792" offset="5264895">It must appear on the face of the statute of the demonstrable where the taxes laid is measured by or has some fair relationship to the use of the highways to which the charge is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.065" offset="5357995">Going back to a minute on this question of what the funds are to be used for, that argument indeed was made in Crandall against Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.282" offset="5390805">There at Page 38, “The state argued that the state makes roads, keeps them in repair, and must in some way be paid in order to be able to do all of this.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.906" offset="5461335">And what difference does it make, whether it is to be paid by a tax of $1.00 on each passenger or by the same sum collected at a toll gate, or by gross sum for a license?</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.645" offset="5512222">The Court in Crandall indicated that it made a good bit of difference as to whether it was constitutional to tax the passenger at $1.00 a head for leaving the state even though he had obviously used the roads, and the state had to build and keep them repaired.</text>

            <text syncTime="1421.444" offset="5759445">In Crandall, it is my recollection, Your Honor, that Crandall was a stage coach operator or owner who was contesting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.255" offset="5846694">Incidentally, the use of the proceeds was argued in the Henderson against the Mayor of New York case where two-thirds of the funds went to the Commissioner of Immigration for inspection and to build wards and warehouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.278" offset="5918792">In the Passenger case part of the funds went to a Marine Hospital in People against Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, the sums went to the Commission of Immigration for inspection expenses and the remainder was remitted to the United States Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.428" offset="6003428">The states at that time were seeking many ways to validate this type of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.493" offset="6043657">And in each one, the argument would be made that the funds were being used to recompense the state for expenses made by it in tearing out its proper functions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1511.770" offset="6120770">Well, I would deal with that in two ways, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.380" offset="6135190">First, it’s not a Commerce Clause but in fact I don’t think it is the most important ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.485" offset="6159641">It is the question under Article 1, Section 10 of the article.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.267" offset="6178762">Secondly, I deal with it by saying that there the Court quite properly found that it was a use tax and was not a tax on a passenger for engaging in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.467" offset="6259533">And I think that the sum of these -- that these passengers are engaging in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.429" offset="6291402">When they board the plane for the purpose of departure, I think it’s fairly obvious under the Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line case where the gathering of gas was considered a tax directly on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.993" offset="6361619">I think the same thing is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.773" offset="6368829">The same thing is present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.999" offset="6377711">I think in the Joseph against Carter &amp; Weeks which was a loading of freight case and Baltimore &amp; Ohio against Birch which was the same type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.104" offset="6426090">The Richfield Oil case where the Court said the commerce begins no later than delivery of oil into the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.873" offset="6453153">All of those, I think indicate very strongly that the passenger boarding the plane for the purpose of departure which is what enplanement means, that the passenger is engaged in interstate commerce and the tax that’s being imposed on him is a tax imposed on him for the privilege of engaging in that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.301" offset="6546880">And the cases that talk about a tax on a passenger engaged in interstate commerce or on a passenger, or on freight that’s being loaded or has been loaded for interstate commerce and striking down those statutes are extremely numerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.576" offset="6655967">Basically, you can probably start under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.896" offset="6685224">I think that basically you can start to submit some of the language in the Passenger Cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.132" offset="6726184">Some of the language by two justices in the Crandall case plus the Perry case which just has a Black has a statement saying that you can’t pass passengers and the people and persons engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.348" offset="6791073">I think the Justice or Chief Justice Taney’s dissenting opinion in the Passenger Cases where he was talking about not aliens but persons who were traveling by ship from one state to another and who were taxed at the rate of 25 cents a head for departing the vessel in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.457" offset="6919490">His comment about those passengers is very strong in saying that the State cannot tax those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.560" offset="6963899">And that dissent was later, I believe, quoted in Crandall and has been re-quoted in cases as recently as Gaston, I think, in the Shapiro case, Shapiro against Thompson as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.375" offset="7039236">In the Minnesota Rate Cases, the Court said, the States cannot tax interstate commerce either by a laying a tax upon the business which constitutes such commerce with the privilege of engaging in it or upon persons of property in transit in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.800" offset="7104855">I would also submit that the fact that here the incident is the act of enplanement rather than use by the passenger, lends itself to considerable different multiple local taxation involving different incidents of travel and also differing amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.244" offset="7186671">As to the amount of the tax, the Evansville Airport Board has stated here on that brief in an argument that even this $1.00 is not enough to cover the cost of their plan of improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.718" offset="7256575">I do not dispute that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.337" offset="7275069">Indeed, as the taxes grow, as this $1.00 becomes more the ingenuity of an Airport Board to plan other improvements can make a charge of almost any amount not excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.155" offset="7342256">So I think that it is quite obvious to anticipate that there will be taxes if this ordinance is allowed to stand, there will be taxes by most local airports in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.872" offset="7441208">The taxes, I think will vary in amount and I think that they will vary as to the incident of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.901" offset="7477257">I think some will be for deplaning passengers, some will be for stopover passengers, and some would be for in-transit passengers.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard P. Trockman</label>
            <text syncTime="1998.143" offset="8066266">I will try to use them as useful as I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.512" offset="8075775">First of all, I would like to comment, Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, on Crandall versus Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.064" offset="8101897">There is no mention on this case whatsoever that this is a tax upon the use of facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.478" offset="8123631">It is the tax upon the mere act of departure upon the privilege of going from one state to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.901" offset="8149335">As a matter of fact, in 1868, when this case was decided, I am not even sure that there was a publicly maintained roadway for the use by a stage coach travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.567" offset="8195938">Certainly, the railroad tax filed with that case was not for the use of publicly supported facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.258" offset="8222687">And as far as the application of that case is concerned, this was stricken and overruled by the case of Hendrick versus Maryland which was decided in 1915 by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.346" offset="8275037">And in this case, it said that with respect to the holding of Crandall versus Nevada involving a tax which was designed to prevent persons from leaving the State of Nevada, that it does not uphold that rationale because in Hendrick versus Maryland, where a tax was levied upon the use of highways by commercial motor vehicles, that this involved the use of valuable facilities provided in public expense and a burden to the taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.223" offset="8406589">And therefore, the holding of Crandall was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.927" offset="8421427">And in Hendrick versus Maryland, which is cited at Pages 29 and 30 of our brief, the Court stated that the highways are public property just like our runways are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.128" offset="8462178">It is within the power of the State to require those who make special use thereof to contribute to their cost in maintenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.441" offset="8495406">And this Court recognized in Hendrick versus Maryland, the distinction between commercial motor vehicles and pleasure cars and upheld the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.956" offset="8529469">The same application applied in a flat fee in the Capitol Greyhound Lines case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.297" offset="8550890">By the way, in that case as we have in our exhibit C is a list of states which have use taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.165" offset="8582341">As to the national uniformity argument which my colleague argues, I would like to say this that the Panhandle Eastern case strikes down this argument by saying the power to taxes not the power to destroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.392" offset="8647229">And this we believe is a relevant holding cited by this Court and we feel that the use tax levied in this instance is fair and reasonable under the Commerce Clause.</text>
