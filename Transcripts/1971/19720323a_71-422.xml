            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73739">We will resume arguments in number 71-422, Lake Carriers Association against MacMullan.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.451" offset="115535">Mr. Solicitor General you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert A. Derengoski</label>
            <text syncTime="13.890" offset="129223">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.541" offset="147822">The Water Resources Act of 1966 and the Water Quality Act of 1970 prescribed to be the national policy that the environment of this country including its waters be cleaned up.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.119" offset="226190">In each of these statutes, they have placed upon the states the primary responsibility for implementing that policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.273" offset="270807">In view in Michigan in the case of the sewage disposal from vessels has enacted a statute which is the ultimate in that area mainly complete retention of sewage and dispose off the (Inaudible) and therefore, I am somewhat surprised at being here.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.054" offset="369863">In response to the question of Mr. Justice White at the conclusion of yesterday’s session, I say that the only controversy now existing between the parties in this cause is the question of how this should be accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.114" offset="450111">Michigan says by complete retention and they say, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.023" offset="473830">In addition, they attacked the statute on numerous constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.488" offset="627639">That is the only controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.511" offset="627535">There is no prosecution pending or eminent at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.761" offset="627430">We realized sir the futility of a prosecution at this time with inadequate shore size pump-out facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.235" offset="627326">But we are working on that and we are making headway until this litigation was commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.817" offset="627221">We realized they must have facilities to pump-out before the law could be properly applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.086" offset="637984">Now, I might go a little further and say insofar as the controversy goes, there is a controversy between the parties in this cause as to what constitutes pollution or clean water.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.919" offset="713321">The appellants in this cause evidently say that by the use of certain devices on their vessels by which they can pull -- if I may use the contradictory term clean soil into wide waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.086" offset="782075">They are aiding and abetting in fulfilling the federal requirements that pollution of our waters be controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.806" offset="816870">Michigan says otherwise, we say in effect “thou shalt not dump.”</text>
            <text syncTime="194.102" offset="850098">Now, putting in its proper perspective, may it please the Court, the devices which these plaintiffs claim will range in their waste less obnoxious to the waters of the State of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.445" offset="927421">I would like to point out that the record shows that at the 187 vessels possessed by these appellants, only some 50 have a device of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.873" offset="985203">In other words, about 15%.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.205" offset="998474">In other words, you have about 85% of your vessels pouring raw, untreated sewage into the waters of the Great Lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.479" offset="1055630">Projecting that to the entire Great Lakes fleet of some 422 vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.194" offset="1078513">The extent of their deprivation is horrendous to be hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.358" offset="1103068">It is a special problem in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.195" offset="1114457">We are surrounded on three sides as the Court knows by waters of the Great Lakes with the longest shoreline in this country except for Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.778" offset="1148835">The bulk of Michigan people take their drinking water from the Great Lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.013" offset="1181749">For example, in Detroit and its suburbs, 3,750,000 people, that was the figure in 1970, take their drinking water from the Detroit River which is one of the bodies of water involved in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.414" offset="1271297">So this seriousness of the situation and the necessity for a total retention requirement by Michigan is also obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.327" offset="1323019">May it please the Court, probably for the first time in my professional career I was pleased to receive a reply brief for in this brief filed by the appellants, I believe the verity of our cause is proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.147" offset="1394281">They say and for the first time they recognized that Michigan has a problem and they say that the problem is solved by the quarantine regulations issued by the public health service under the guidance of the surgeon general in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.198" offset="1474529">Now, I do not intend to be snide or patched in this remark.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.253" offset="1498666">Brother Elder has conducted himself in accordance with the highest standards of the profession during the conduct of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.818" offset="1524998">By the at least 1960 regulation of the surgeon general was of such significance in this cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.494" offset="1559688">Why was it not before the District Court in the 1971 trial of this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="378.735" offset="1588632">I read the surgeon general’s requirements Your Honor insofar as at least Michigan is concerned are quite meaningless numbered paragraph 3 for example, exempts from the requirements vessels which have sewage disposal devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.304" offset="1670866">I have just given you the figures showing how few of these vessels have any device whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.524" offset="1699809">Further in number paragraph 1 of the regulations, it says that all vessels moored shall not discharge sewage, etcetera into the waters if there are dockside facilities available for the disposition of same.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.139" offset="1778281">Well, that is one of the complaints of appellants in this cause that there are no pump-out facilities anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.836" offset="1805030">Although under the surgeon general’s regulations, these people just continue to dump and the basic requirement of the surgeon general requirement is that there shall be no disposal of sewage within three miles of a public water intake.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.666" offset="1888309">Well, Your Honor, that presupposes that the way we use the water, the current and even the sun are just perfect and that the effluent dumped will remain in one spot.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.355" offset="1959153">Those living at the Midwest would know that such a day has never occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.492" offset="1983603">And insofar as three-mile pump-out prohibition is concerned at a three mile radius, the Detroit river river from which I said 3,750,000 people take their water supply is that at its widest point in mile and a half.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.222" offset="6582617">Your Honor I will be very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.064" offset="6593902">We certainly agree that the water should be cleaned up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.431" offset="6611457">We are not asking for a license to pollute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.710" offset="6628488">But if pollution control is valid in Michigan, it’s valid in every other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.834" offset="6657014">Mr. Derengoski said it’s a problem of control that these vessels are moving sources and therefore the state can’t police them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.028" offset="6689824">Who is in a better position to police the pollution than the United States Coastguard which licensed the vessels, inspects the vessels, and has the confident personnel?</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.885" offset="6733187">Our whole purpose here is to promote the pollution control on a uniform basis throughout the entire Great Lakes so that our vessels can install the equipment, whatever it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.302" offset="6786895">Now this Court does not have to decide what the equipment is or what standards are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.340" offset="6811032">But I think this Court is to be bound to decide on the basis of the uniform maritime law that this should be applicable throughout the entire Great Lakes so we can go anywhere to any port.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.943" offset="6865471">Now, the uniform maritime law dictates that in order to carry on commerce, these vessels have to be free to move from port to port.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.338" offset="6919075">I don’t think this is a question that was ever really reached in the Harman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.179" offset="6938405">We do have one other element here and that is the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 between United States and Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.644" offset="6964214">This in turn calls for uniform regulation and I think as a matter of international law, the individual states such as Michigan and Ohio and so forth are not recognized for purposes of treaties and so forth as separate entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.059" offset="7025968">They are part of the United States and the Boundary Water Treaty entitles our Canadian friends and our own vessels to a right to travel throughout the Great Lakes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1776.248" offset="7178627">Finally, one thing I want to point out here, as Mr. Justice Marshall know it, we do have all these people living in Michigan taking their drinking water from the Great Lakes but also the waste created by those people are going right back into the lake through the municipal plants which at best have only primary treatment, and then Michigan in this brief on page 2 the third paragraph says, after talking about these vessels (Inaudible) that it says the municipal systems are normal point of discharge and the water quality for that particular area be set and governed accordingly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1838.647" offset="7428253">The second point is that these very same devices and we have on our vessels, mainly the biogase system are recognized and used in shopping centers, in small communities, the very same device is permitted on land in Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.869" offset="7493141">Now, we say it’s a violation of the Equal Protection Clause to permit them to go ahead and use them on land and not let us use them on the ships but really, we’re doing less harm than anybody because for the most part of your ships lay out on the lake or away from shore, away from populous areas and we think this is a denial of the Equal Protection laws.</text>
