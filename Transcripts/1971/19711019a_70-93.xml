            <text syncTime="59.504" offset="311646">In this case the District Court on jurisdictional grounds dismissed the complaint filed by the National Labor Relations Board and denied the Board's motion for a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.674" offset="376325">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.985" offset="393566">There is no decision here on the merits of the Board's claim and there has been no findings of fact on which a decision on the merits would ordinarily be predicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.066" offset="449886">The decision was made is on the complaint and on the motion for the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.764" offset="476740">The complaint is set forth beginning at page Four of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.960" offset="501504">In it the Board recites that unfair labor practice charges had been filed with the Board by the union which is appearing here as amicus, the amount to made Meat Cutters Union against the respondent Company that on the basis of this charge, a trial examiner of the Board had found that the Company had violated the National Labor Relations Act in several respects by wrongfully refusing to bargain with the Union and by committing another unfair Labor practices relating to the union's organizational campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.519" offset="687705">I should say incidentally that after the present suit was filed as the briefs point out, the Board in ruling on the company's exceptions disagreed with the hearing examiner, concerning their refusal to bargain and held that the Board -- that the Union had not established majority status, but the Board did agree that the Company had committed certain and other unfair Labor practices and issued a cease and desist order for which the company has complied and there is no question here about enforcement of the Board’s order.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.177" offset="834409">The complaint further recited that approximately one month after the issuance of the hearing examiner's decision, employees of the company began to picket the Company stores and the Company ran into the State Court and obtained an injunction against the picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.734" offset="944645">The copy of the injunction was amended as an exhibit to the board's complaint.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="328.379" offset="1387160">Well, we understand that to be the law under guidance and related cases through Ariadne.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="339.211" offset="1430523">Well that is what we understand the law should be Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.848" offset="1449018">And there is no occasion at this stage, that the present case to reach that issue because under either view taken in Ariadne, we think saying this position would be appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.424" offset="1515369">Now, in a prayer for relief the Board was quite specific in stating that it wished to have enjoin the enforcement of those portions of the State Court injunction that were within the preempted area in the board's view and those portions are more specifically set out in the Board's motion for a preliminary injunction which is set forth in the appendix on pages 33 and 34 of our appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.128" offset="1670223">There is quotation or portions of the injunction which the Board seeks to have the enforcement of enjoined and there are several ellipsis in the quoted portions numbered one, two and three.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.462" offset="1735529">The first occurred at the beginning of the Part Two and then some parts A and B of part two are omitted and then there is another ellipsis in part three.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.543" offset="1783803">These ellipsis are those Parts of the order referring to the blocking of egress or ingress to the premises of the company to interference with the flow of traffic or the stationing of more than two pickets at anyone store owned by the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.142" offset="1886203">So there has been no attempt here to oust the State Court of jurisdiction, like you are entirely supersede the State Court’s injunction and no where in the prior for relief is there any contention raised that the State statutes are unconstitutional under the First Amendment or under any other provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.012" offset="1981707">There is no declaratory judgment about the Constitutionality of State statutes sought, nor any broad injunction against enforcement of the State statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.005" offset="2021726">Those issues that are mooted in amicus briefs in this Court in case with a suggestion that the abstention doctrine might come into play before a Federal Court should involve itself in that question, but the question has not been put before the District Court in the complaint or in the motion for a preliminary injunction and the question is not here as we see the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="772.910" offset="3165263">The holding is stated really in a single part of the sentence that we had at the end of quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.474" offset="3195565">The interpretation excluding the United States in the coverage of the statute seems to us preferable in the context of healthy Federal State Relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.005" offset="3241645">Immediately after that sentence in Leiter Minerals, a new paragraph begins with the word that the Court will then turn to the merits of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.484" offset="3315623">The question still remains whether the granting of an injunction was proper in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.457" offset="3343522">Any discussion in the opinion relating to the particular facts of Leiter followed that statement by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.071" offset="3378004">The interpretation of 2283 on the jurisdictional question was the simple interpretation, that the United States has excluded from the coverage of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.126" offset="3434219">That interpretation is now unchanged by Congress for 14 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.526" offset="3459819">Now, it is frankly difficult perhaps to think of reasons why it should make a difference in terms the purposes of Section 2283 or the rational of any of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.887" offset="3525230">Why it should make a difference whether the suit is brought in the name of the United States or in the name of a particular agency?</text>
            <text syncTime="871.689" offset="3560443">A recent decision by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit seems to us to illustrate this very well and we referred in our brief on page 25, Note 11 to the litigation that was then pending which has now been decided by both of District Court and the Court of Appeals, a case called the United States against City of New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.618" offset="3684159">In that case a State Court injunction had been obtained against the use of a particular runway in the New Haven Airport, that Federal Aviation Administration, of course has jurisdiction over the safety of Airports and the provision of Airport services and it is part of the Executive Branch of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.646" offset="3784260">It is now part of the Department of Transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.523" offset="3799725">The Justice Department in its behalf filed suit in the Federal District Court to enjoin the enforcement of that State Court injunction as having invaded an area within the province of the Federal Regulatory Scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="968.612" offset="3948100">It is hard to see any other difference as I am about to point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.752" offset="3968685">The suit was brought and the District Court upheld the jurisdiction within Leiter Minerals and issued to preliminary injunction and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recently affirmed the granting of the preliminary injunction on a case decided August 31, 1971, docket number 71-1669, it is called United States against the City of New Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.771" offset="4084773">Now, it seems for purposes of the statutory policy in Section 2283, New Haven stands that the Federal Aviation Administration is not empowered to sue in its own name, sue within the name of the United States, yet other agencies which has very comparable responsibilities for the provision of the services to the public, such as the Interstate Commerce Commission, Federal Power Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, do have statutory authority to sue in their own name, would be implementing Federal policies and interference with Federal policies by bringing entirely comparable suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.133" offset="4258226">It is hard to think of any reason why they should be a difference should result on the jurisdictional ground under Section 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.796" offset="4296887">Now, this does not mean that a host of new cases, a large volume of additional litigation would be opening up as a result recognition of the scope of the governmental exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.025" offset="4365746">It seems to us that it was recognized a while ago in Bowles against Willingham for that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.160" offset="4390301">There had been establishment of it under the office of Price Administration Legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.062" offset="4417886">It is true that the opinion in that case pointed to statutory authority for the administrator to seek injunction, that statutory authority did not specify that injunctions could be sought against the enforcement of State Court judgment and it is really not significantly different from the statutory authority of any other agencies seek injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.659" offset="4520286">We have inquired of a number of agencies to determine what their experience has been in this field and most of them had replied that they cannot recall an instance in which they had to seek relief against a State Court judgment where they could not at least attempt to justify that relief or within the rationale of the express exception in Section 2283, but several of them did mention to us that such cases could arise that would very important to the administration of their statute and for that reason they are interested in the outcome of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.218" offset="4682559">I will cite just one instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.960" offset="4693530">The Federal Trade Commission and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission both pointed out to us that under certain statutory provisions they have an obligation to conduct an investigation from secret and to keep the matters that they investigate confidential and they would be concerned about possible disclosure of some these matters in State Court proceeding and would be rather hard pressed to justify relief under the express exception to 2283 in such a circumstance, it has not yet arisen, but it could arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.323" offset="4842951">The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission points out its particular concern because of the statutory policy behind the confidentiality of their investigation, a policy of protecting complainants and witnesses against reprieved or intimidation and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.784" offset="4920796">So there are some important policies involved here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1364.227" offset="5530598">Indeed this kind of injunction seems to have the policies of Norris-LaGuardia by presenting State Court interference with the equal settlement of labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.370" offset="5595173">Well, I think one other statutory position might be pointed out as an example of the immateriality even to Congress of this distinction and that is a provision of the interstate commerce act which is a particular provision and is entitled 49 of the Code, Section 16, sub Section 12, entitled proceedings to enforce orders other than for payment of money and there the statute provides if any carrier fails or neglects to obey any order of the Commission other than for the payment of money while the order is in effect, the Interstate Commerce Commission or any party entered thereby or the United States by its Attorney General may apply to any District Court of the United States for the enforcement of the order, a District Court of competent jurisdiction and so that is just an example of congress’ attitude its policies and its statute are to be enforced by whoever has the litigating authority, in that case in the alternative by the United States or by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.604" offset="5916061">It is difficult for us to see the materiality of this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.196" offset="5934451">Now, in the Labor Relations field the question is of perhaps a greater significance and will or has produced a somewhat larger line of litigation already.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.505" offset="5987741">The Board informs me that it gets about a dozen complaints a year, requests that it files suits of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.595" offset="6020028">It has on the average been filing less than one per year and partly of course because of doubts about of the outcome of this issue, but also because it selects these cases carefully and plans to continue to do so, if it is successful in this litigation which seems to us to point out the significant difference between suits brought by public authority to vindicate the important Federal policies reflected in the National Labor Relations Act and other statutes and private litigation which has been bared under 2283 and which was really the concern of Congress in enacting 2283 and its predecessors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.965" offset="6209573">The difficulties in the enforcement of the policies that the act that result from injunctions of the type issued by the State Court here, we think are manifest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.704" offset="6260459">Indeed the District Judge himself spelled them out in a rather regretful paragraph in his opinion in which he said that the decision leads to really non-less result and they have been rehearsed previously in opinions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.370" offset="6351156">Now, the question remains what alternatives would be open to the Board with not able to secure relief in the fashion it is seeking here, at least to have its complaint entertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.348" offset="6431091">Other than leaving the matter to private litigation entirely which means unsatisfactory, it might add responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.376" offset="6463170">There are only two possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.307" offset="6470902">One is to seek to intervene or to participate as amicus curiae in the State Court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.620" offset="6496188">Whether it could intervene since no order of the Board is at issue would be highly questionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.438" offset="6519385">If it could not participate as a party, intervener then whether an appeal would be taken would be out of his hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.403" offset="6555330">In addition even if it could participate, it would be subjected to the possible pitfalls of unfamiliar State procedure, the possible limitations of state discovery proceedings and other disadvantages in comparison with the Federal forum where Congress contemplated it would be doing is litigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.051" offset="6649893">The other possible alternative is the suggestion that was raised in the Court’s opinion in Richman Brothers that perhaps the filing of a State Court preceding that interferes with the area preempted by the National Labor Relations Act might itself be an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.584" offset="6748009">The Board, and we have pointed out in our brief, has careful consideration, rejected this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.032" offset="6781759">When a suit is brought in good faith in a State Court to invoke remedies provided for by State Statute and it seems to us that for the Board to hold that good faith suit and such circumstances could be brought only if the risk of being held and committed an unfair labor practice would be a far greater intrusion on the prerogatives of the State and the dignity of State procedures to prevent even the invoking in good faith of State remedies than is the settled interpretation as we understand it, of Section 2283.</text>

            <text syncTime="1883.054" offset="7605870">Therefore, it was understandable that the company would not have easy access to the names or identity of those people and that the State Court therefore required that anyone that was being presumably paid by the union to come and picket with first come to the State Court, and identify themselves and submit to its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.276" offset="7670758">So these were not employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.070" offset="7677968">These were presumably paid union personnel that were conducting picketing. Secondly and perhaps most importantly, the picketing in the instant case is acknowledged and judicially has been determined as mass picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.418" offset="7739303">On the one hand we will have peaceful picketing and on the other end of the spectrum, we have non-peaceful picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.080" offset="7749961">In between a type of picketing that maybe either or both is a type of picketing that most State Courts attach statutes regarding and which they refer to as mass picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.069" offset="7789981">In implementing its duty under a State Police power to protect the rights of its citizens and to make the conclusion that they may not be hampered by any type of picketing that would prohibit ingress and egress or lead to violence, most States prohibit, as does the Nebraska Statute, the numbers of pickets that maybe placed and specifically states that they may not prohibit the ingress and egress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.917" offset="7897292">The Nebraska Statute has few other factors in it which suffice it to say that the affidavits which we have submitted in the State Court which are set forth in appendix 2 in our brief, indicates that there was substantial blocking of ingress and egress by these non-employee pickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.288" offset="7970853">That there were substantially more than the numbers allowed by the State Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.848" offset="7989034">There were also some other areas of some threats to both customers of the stores or store employees which suffice to say Your Honors, if the Board comes before this Court or rather piously proclaiming, this is peaceful picketing and it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.673" offset="8044414">There is a judicial determination that it is mass picketing and there is a little bit difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.668" offset="8060296">Because if it is peaceful picketing only the company acknowledges that there is obviously at least an arguable, at least an arguable conclusion that the picketing is therefore, totally, completely governed by the National Liberations Act and the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.927" offset="8129364">However, if it is mass picketing there is a very substantial State interest involved under the State Police powers and that is what we have at issue in this case, Your Honors that State Police power versus what the Board would ask this Court do which is to imply to it an exception on the basis of federal preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.806" offset="8192894">So that it may go into any Federal District Court anywhere in the country and get an injunction of any State implementing this peaceful -- it is police powers as regards mass picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.253" offset="8238660">Now, we also note in our brief Your Honors that, it is truly we have never had any holding on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.572" offset="8267917">There has never been any findings of fact by the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.645" offset="8284218">Unfortunately, we were not really in a position to be vitally concerned about this since we already had our judicial determination that it was mass picketing, now that is security issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.873" offset="8321207">The Board was the moving party in the Federal District Court made no effort to place any of those facts before the Court and as noted in oral argument the case was determined on our motion to dismiss and then it was affirmed by the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.342" offset="8378990">But there are police courts or Police Department, Fire Department records, records of the State Department of Agriculture which we note in our brief that we believe this Court could take judicial notice of which indicate that there were substantially other activities that could properly be used to classify this picketing as violent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2282.872" offset="9205191">Well, the reason I say I do not believe it is properly before this Court is because the Board can adequately get around the limitations of 2283 and it could have and should have proceeded in the State Court and could have (Inaudible) its problems there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.469" offset="9263496">There are number of reasons why we believe that this Court should conclude if the Lower Court was correct in what it did, I would like to first draw the Court’s attention to the statutory framework in which Section 2283 appeared to the District Court as is denoted by this Court in previous questions, the Norris-LaGuardia Act indicate that Federal District Courts are not encouraged to grant injunctive relief in labor matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.325" offset="9366941">29 U.S. Code, Sections 101 and 104 indicate that they should not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.580" offset="9383973">In fact Sections 107 and 109 indicate that they should make detailed findings of fact before they would ever enter such scenario granting injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.441" offset="9423470">But, notwithstanding that fact, 29 U.S. Code, Section 160 usually referred to as Sections 10 (j) and 10 (l) of the act gives to the Labor Board the power to go ahead in certain situations in the Federal District Court and obtain injunctive relief if they feel it is an extraordinary circumstance where they should exercise that power and go in and get that injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.246" offset="9518660">In addition to that of course, we have 28 U.S. Code 2283 which has been law in some form since 1793 and I submit to the Court, Your Honors that the distinction is somewhat more basic than that even as has been noted in the amicus brief by the National Chamber of Commerce and in our brief that this has been a long standing implementation of the notion in Congress that there should and must be a dual Court system in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.156" offset="9630255">I direct Your Honors’ attention to the Federalist paper number 46 which we note in our brief where Mr. Madison, wherein he indicates that there is an even deeper division in that because when the people of this country who are the sovereign gave to the new Federal Government its power to do what they allowed it to do, that there was considerable concern over what that Federal Government might do to the State Governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.387" offset="9731192">Mr. Madison notes quite clearly at number 46 that if there is an area where a State Court infringes on an area that the Federal Government thinks is unfriendly to it, did notwithstanding that fact, the States must clearly have the advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.288" offset="9790856">And reason in that is because the States were giving the power to the Federal Government and that they must maintain that advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.684" offset="9820427">And so, we would say that Section 2283 came before the District Court with a very, very basic distinction between the Federal and the State Court judicial systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.964" offset="9861491">Based upon that, the State action in giving the company relief and redress under the State mass picketing statute is certainly not before this Court on the grounds that that is not within their power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.711" offset="9924499">For as noted in numerous decisions before this Court as set out in our brief on page 13, this Court has many times noted that regulation of mass picketing by State Courts and by State Statute is clearly and completely within the province of the State Police powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.737" offset="9996596">It was upon this statutory framework then that this matter reached the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.227" offset="10022614">At that point the Board raised its two arguments that it, number one should be considered the United States for the purposes of this action and get around Section 2283 and at number 2 it could be considered to get around Section 2283 simply because it had been established by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.715" offset="10088547">I suppose they base it on a very large federal preemption argument on this issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2591.186" offset="10438379">Nevertheless, this case is still before the Court because the Board maintains that it should be considered the United States because there is no reason to consider that it would not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.990" offset="10481638">But Your Honors of course, it is recognized that the Federal Government is a government of limited of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.065" offset="10501909">It is also a government of specific powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.624" offset="10512149">The Labor Board was established not to be the United States for all intents and purposes but it was established to be a specific agency of the Government to enforce a specific statute under specific policy directives of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.601" offset="10576097">I do not believe that Congress intended to make the Labor Board into what might be referred to as a Frankenstein’s monster and that it could go across the entire country doing what it would like and considering that it had the powers, immunities and privileges of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.865" offset="10637119">Indeed, this Court has noted previously in cases very similar that agencies of the United States Government as noted in the Menihan case which we note in our brief on page 20, page 23, that this Court has previously concluded that agencies of the United States are not to be considered to have and to posses the powers, privileges and immunities of the United States unless that Congress clearly grants that power to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.661" offset="10748296">And Your Honors the Board points no specific statutory authority for their claim that they maybe considered the United States for the purposes of this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.154" offset="10782255">Indeed, all they want to do is circumvent another specific statutory provision which is 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.621" offset="10812139">Yet they point to know specific statute granting them that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.365" offset="10835127">They do point to what they refer to as implied exceptions under form of Section 265.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.650" offset="10860309">In our brief, as we noted, as this Court noted in the Richman Brothers’ case, there is no need really to consider those implied exceptions because it is clear that the Congress did not intent for any implied exceptions to live beyond the enactment of Section 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.097" offset="10926033">But for argument’s sake, it should be noted that the cases that the Board relies upon are not really cases wherein our judicially implied exceptions because there was, in fact, conflicting statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.493" offset="10983607">In four of the cases the Board relies upon, that authority was granted by Section 205 (c) of the Emergency Price Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.332" offset="11014954">The most noted of those cases was Bowles v. Willingham.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.924" offset="11029374">In fact, it is notable that approximately 10 days ago, the Government went down the street to argue in the District of Columbia Circuit and told Judge Leventhal that the Bowles v. Willingham case specifically gave the President the power to do what he is doing now in the Wage and Price Control freeze because it was an emergency statute and they used Bowles as the basis for their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.606" offset="11112130">Yet, they come in to this Court today and argue that the Bowles case is just a clear indication of the fact that any government agency can be given a power of the United States under rather broad argument of federal preemption and make no mention of the fact that that was an Emergency Price Control Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.254" offset="11182660">That was not a regulation statute as we would note in the general sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.829" offset="11205021">However, two additional cases cited by the Board in its brief specifically gave jurisdiction to Federal District Courts under Section 79 (k) of the Public Utilities Holding Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.518" offset="11251728">The final case cited by the Board as a presumed exception under former Section 265 was given specific authority, gave specific jurisdiction of the District Court under the Agricultural Marketing Act Section 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.598" offset="11312019">So the Board comes before this Court not with implied judicial exceptions but with conflicting statutory authority under prior Section 265.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.098" offset="11350053">And that Your Honors as was noted in the revisers' note of Section 2283, was why the Congress passed Section 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.162" offset="11382340">They had to get their House in order and note specifically when jurisdiction was granted to a Federal District Court and they took care of that by placing the first exception under Section 2283 the words “except where specifically authorized by Congress” and the Board is specifically authorized by Congress under Section 10 (j) and 10 (l), to seek and to obtain injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.975" offset="11481605">But those Sections did not apply to this case as the Board acknowledges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.050" offset="11497906">We submit Your Honors that had the Congress intended to give the Board the power to get injunctive relief in other situations, it would have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.518" offset="11531761">Every place where it has given the Board power, it has specified that power, especially Your Honors in the area of injunctive relief which might be distinguished from rather more administrative powers which the Board notes in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.512" offset="11591738">Of course not all of the powers to implement that statute were given to the Board and the statute of course not as far as administrative matters to be concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.217" offset="11622562">But when it comes to an injunctive power, those powers have been specific in their implementation by the Congress and we would submit that since 10 (j) and 10 (l) do not apply to this case, the Board has no statutory power to attempt to get the injunction that it seeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.184" offset="11694451">Now in addition, in oral argument, the Board notes or the respondent would rely upon through another indication of why the Board should not be before this Court claiming to be the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.141" offset="11746278">49 U.S. Code, Section 16 dealing with the powers of the ICC as the Board noted specifically says that to implement those statutes either the ICC may do so any aggrieved party or the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.630" offset="11812211">It is fairly obvious that the Congress need not have said the ICC or the United States if there was no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.676" offset="11840423">But the regulatory agencies of the Government are not parts of the Executive Branch of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.065" offset="11865919">It is specifically noted in even the Government Organization Manual put out by the Government printing office that there is a distinction between branches of the Executive Government and regulatory agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.601" offset="11920045">In fact, there are 51 regulatory agencies, including the Labor Board lifted as administrative agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.819" offset="11948988">Your Honors, this distinction was drawn by this Court sometime ago in the case of Montgomery’s Executor wherein a Federal Trade Commission case involved the power of the President to remove a member of that commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.361" offset="12011160">Now, this Court concluded that since the Federal Trade Commission was not an Executive Branch of the Government that therefore the President did not have that power and in so doing clearly and carefully drew the distinction between Executive Branches of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.682" offset="12076361">Those branches that do not have the power to sue in their own name but must sue as the United States and are indeed to be considered the United States as opposed to administrative agencies, for example, the Federal Trade Commission and as was noted in oral argument by the Board, FAA in a case before the Second Circuit has sued under the name of the United States, but it is in fact an Executive Branch of the Government and that is a significant difference that is not found in this case because the Labor Board does sue in its own name but it is not the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.298" offset="12222856">It does not have all the privileges, powers, immunities of the United States and that it therefore may not come under this Court’s decision in Leiter Minerals to remove itself from the prohibition of Section 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.908" offset="12285341">An additional argument that the Board makes is that not withstanding any argument that it might be considered the United States, it should be allowed to proceed in this case simply because it was established by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.341" offset="12343019">It has preempted the area of labor relation and that therefore it should be able to proceed against any State Court that gets into the area of labor relations in any degree I would imagine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.296" offset="12398817">That argument was advanced also in the Richman Brothers’ case. Justice Frankfurter in that case noted that that argument must be rejected simply because federal statutes may have preempted an area, Section 2283 must be strictly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.326" offset="12474990">And that unless there is a specific act of Congress, unless it is in aid of that Court’s jurisdiction or to effectuate the judgments of that Court, no Federal District Court may overlook the limitations of Section 2283.</text>

            <text syncTime="3136.324" offset="12618977">Well, Your Honor that is an internal procedure that the government follows, that I do not have any control over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.217" offset="12638516">I know that there are several people at the Labor Board that would like to be here today but the Solicitor is not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.099" offset="12666102">The fact is Your Honor that we do not discount the fact that they are an agency to the Federal Government that they have work of a federal nature to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.751" offset="12704659">What we do say though is that that work of a federal nature to do, has been specifically granted to them in at least as regards the injunctive power, a power that the Congress does not wish exercised by Federal District Courts in labor matters generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.143" offset="12782294">But the Congress has been careful to only grant limited power to the Labor Board to proceed for injunctive relief and that that power has not been given to the Board to circumvent the limitations of 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.444" offset="12839450">From a practical standpoint, the argument of preemption by the Labor Board really attempts to get the cart before the horse because what it tries to do is to get the merits of the case in before jurisdiction is initially granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.305" offset="12902876">And this of course was why the District Court denied the jurisdiction of claims of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.827" offset="12925027">In fact, as we noted in our brief, later Mr. Justice Cardozo when he was deciding cases for the State of New York noted that rights exist and that they maybe granted after jurisdiction has been found, but that rights in and out of themselves may not confer jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.791" offset="13024815">This is what the Board would seek to have this Court to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.644" offset="13052296">There are additional practical reasons to conclude that the Labor Board should not properly be before this Court seeking to circumvent limitations of Section 2283 to go beyond the system, the system of dual courts that has long been established and that is because the Labor Board does not even exercise the power that it is granted under Sections 10 (j) and 10 (l) as noted in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.633" offset="13160234">In over 75% of what it acknowledges to be meritorious cases it does not seek to obtain injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.864" offset="13193148">It is rather anomalous then that the Board comes before this Court and urges this Court to imply into a judicially legislative power that the Congress has not granted to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.475" offset="13235571">For all of these reasons then, we urge this Court to again strictly construe Section 2283 to conclude that the Board may not on a basis of federal preemption alone circumvent the limitations of Section 2283 into referring the Lower Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3318.505" offset="13347689">I would just like to say a word or two about some of the cases relied on by the respondent figuring Nathanson against the National Labor Relations Board in which this Court in construing the Bankruptcy Act decided that an award of back pay owing to the Labor Board while it was debt owing to the Labor Board was functionally in the category of wages owing to work rather than a sum of money owing to the Treasury of the United States and should accordingly be awarded the priority of wages rather than debts owing to the United States for purposes of applying the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.857" offset="13521142">It is hard for me to think that any different result would have been reached in that case had the debt technically been owing to the United States but to be used for the same purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.907" offset="13565341">The reasoning of the Court was that this was not a payment to go into the Federal Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.214" offset="13590523">Reconstruction of Finance Corporation against Menihan was a case which the Court held that the Corporation distinguished from Federal agency which had statutory authority to sue and be sued like other corporations should not come within the statutory provision exempting the United States from interest payment in litigation, but the ordinary rules of litigation should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.610" offset="13704103">The National Labor Relations Board and other Federal agencies were for years operating under the Federal provision exempting the United States from interest payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.631" offset="13748198">So we are not paying interest in litigation and it is only since the amendment of that provision with respect to all litigation by the United States that practices change for the agency in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.962" offset="13805563">Now, if there is any further question about the Norris-LaGuardia Act in this matter I am informed that the Board did brief the question of why the Norris-LaGuardia Act should not apply in this kind of case.</text>
