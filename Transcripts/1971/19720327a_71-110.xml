            <label>Mr. Michael E. Tigar</label>
            <text syncTime="22.083" offset="88294">Mr. Chief Justice Burger and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.153" offset="104594">I seek in its argument to show on constitutional and statutory premises that the opinion below is an unwarranted assault on settled principles, personal liberty and would permit the Government to violate the law without paying the price for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.044" offset="172095">The issue if the Court please is whether a grand jury witness, under compulsion to testify, may prevent the use of wiretap material obtained in violation of his or her rights against him or her in the grand jury proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.313" offset="237192">The facts are these, David Gelbard and Sidney Parnas were subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury in Los Angeles in February 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.462" offset="281809">They became aware that they had been overheard on a Court ordered wiretap, conducted under the provisions of the 1968 Omnibus Crime Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.329" offset="317231">The Government conceded that it intended to use the transcripts of petitioner’s overheard conversations to refresh petitioner’s recollection and to formulate questions to them before the grand jury, thus the Government admits that it intended to disclose or cause disclosure of overheard conversations of these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.164" offset="404584">Petitioners claim that the taps were illegal and refused to answer questions until they were afforded a hearing at which the legality issue could be determined and, under what the Government terms in its brief in the Egan case, the constitutional rule of Silverthorne, the Government foreclosed from disclosing this material in questioning petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.703" offset="486713">The District Court denied a hearing and ordered petitioners summarily committed for civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.295" offset="509179">The Court of Appeals affirmed and this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.632" offset="526524">Our argument embraces three points if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.556" offset="542198">First, if disclosure is permitted before the grand jury in questioning these petitioners, they will suffer a harm of which the law can take notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.766" offset="583053">Second, there is a remedy, constitutional, inherent power and statutory for this harm and third, I’d like to deal with the implications, the government’s position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.205" offset="632790">The Government says in its brief that the harm that one suffers from being the victim of a wiretap is ended when the tap is disconnected.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="170.544" offset="682109">It’s what is ended?</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Tigar</label>
            <text syncTime="171.443" offset="685767">Is ended when the tap is disconnected, that is Mr. Justice Stewart that there is no further harm from disclosing this material, even assuming it was illegally overheard.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.889" offset="727458">This is not the rule that this Court has established, it is not the rule for example of Silverthorne versus United States, of Gelbard Importing Company versus United States, and although the case rests on statutory premises Nardone versus United States, Rio versus United States and other cases decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.966" offset="807811">It is not the rule as established in such an elementary treaties is passed around the torts which identifies public disclosure of private facts is a crucial element of the Tort Law Right of Privacy.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael E. Tigar</label>
            <text syncTime="213.414" offset="853577">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.714" offset="854831">In your cases as distinguished from those that are to follow, was the wiretap authorized by warrant?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_e_tigar" startTime="224.092" stopTime="240.343">
            <label>Mr. Michael E. Tigar</label>
            <text syncTime="224.092" offset="896313">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.798" offset="903105">It was in both cases we have Court ordered wiretaps in which a determination of probable cause was made against other persons than the petitioners, the petitioners wandered in to the ambit of these Court ordered wiretaps.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="240.343" stopTime="242.193">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="240.343" offset="961306">I just want to be sure to get that and I was clearing my mind.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_e_tigar" startTime="242.193" stopTime="633.605">
            <label>Mr. Michael E. Tigar</label>
            <text syncTime="242.193" offset="968725">I was just coming to that Mr. Chief Justice because the third kind of harm we’re talking about here is the statutory harm under the very act, under which the warrants were issued, that is to say Section 2511 of Title 18 makes it a federal crime to disseminate information unlawfully obtained by wiretapping and electronic surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.303" offset="1061198">Thus, the petitioners would be victims of such a federal crime before the grand jury and indeed looking at 2510 through 2520 of Title 18, one can see that the quid pro quo which Congress accepted for granting this broad power to tap and bug was a set of very detailed limitations upon the manner in which this material is to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.763" offset="1155030">With then, there is harm here to the petitioners, what is the remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="295.230" offset="1180839">The Government, if the Court please, concedes at page 23 of its brief in the Egan case which it adopts as its brief in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.425" offset="1221695">That if there was a pre-subpoena, adjudication that these taps were illegal, the Court, in adjudicating them illegal, under what it aptly terms, the Constitutional Rule of Silverthorne would and could prohibit the Government from using this illegally obtained material against these petitioners in this very grand jury proceeding, that is petitioners could hire a lawyer, file a civil suit under the authority of Go-Bart Importing Company, or Rio against United States or the Bivens case decided in this Court, short time ago and invoked a consistent course of Federal decision going back 60 years to Wise versus Henkel, in 220 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.711" offset="1402776">They would claim that the inherent power of the Federal Court could be used reaching out the Federal Equity Power to enjoin the Government for making use of this material.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.853" offset="1455334">Of course, as this Court has heard this morning, an argument in Tatum case, the Government might claim in such a civil suit that the case was not right for an injunction to issue, that is if the petitioners could not, before they have received the subpoena, demonstrate the kind of immediate harm that the Federal Equity Power has customarily used to protect against.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.834" offset="1563272">But petitioner’s case, if the Court please, could not be more right, and that is why it is incredible to us that the Government won’t go the last six inches with us, since they have agreed on just about everything else and say that when the petitioners are standing in the jail house door that surely they have a right to prevent the use against them of this material.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.404" offset="1661597">They are not, the petitioners are not, like the defendant in the case of Blue against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.412" offset="1693571">In the position of a gratuitous intervener in the grand jury, who merely suspects that here she is being talked about in the secrecy of the grand jury room and wants to stop the grand jury’s process.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.939" offset="1743726">No, they are standing in the jailhouse door because the material the Government admits is going to be used against them in the grand jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.495" offset="1785940">So this case is no different, from asking a District Court to sustain any other claim of privilege, any other claim of privacy protecting privilege if the Court please, at the behest of any other grand jury witness, in any other grand jury, in any Federal Court in the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.685" offset="1882697">In this connection, we ask the Court to note, as I mentioned before to the petitioners are after all, if this tap is illegal, being made the victim of a federal crime and they’re in the grand jury room.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.726" offset="1926896">And so the Government asks this Court to break the promise which this Court made, in the Alderman case in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.407" offset="1965558">First, by negating what Alderman termed the constitutional rule that forbids using the fruits of unlawful tapping against persons who, like the petitioners are agreed and second, they want to undermine Alderman by urging this Court to permit the Government to commit the federal crime detailed in Section 2511 and in this Court’s words, to let those who flop the rules go unscathed and to cavalierly disregard the rights of the person done with the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.229" offset="2084885">So this Court can decide this case based on elementary principles of equity jurisprudence with some attention to the mandate of the Fourth Amendment in protecting the right of privacy, and some attention to the inherent power in the words of Wise versus Henkel of the District Court to protect against abuse of its process by its officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.076" offset="2176209">The constitution surely requires no less, but there is, as two Courts of Appeals, one of them en bank have held a statutory ground of decision, which is available to the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.686" offset="2230648">A 1968 Act, Sections 2510 through 2520 of Title 18 provide for notice, for hearing, and for suppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.201" offset="2284774">At the instance of those who like petitioners, are about to be harmed by surveillance against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.755" offset="2311001">Section 2515 of the Act forbids the use of material unlawfully obtained in any Court or grand jury proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.987" offset="2351856">Section 2518 of the act in Subdivision 9, requires that before material obtained under the Act is to be used against a person, there must be ten days notice given to that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.880" offset="2415491">Other way this is one answer to the Government’s contention that our position here is going to sabotage grand juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.510" offset="2442031">The Government knew it was going to use the fruits of this tapping against Mr. Gelbard and Mr. Parnas.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.471" offset="2465855">If they had sent ten days before that grand jury appearance a letter saying we intend to use it, Mr. Gelbard and Parnas could have come in to the District Court, asked the District Judge to look at the order authorizing the tap, gotten the threshold determination of legality and illegality.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.605" offset="2534400">Mr. Tigar, I think I heard you say several times, something to the effect that Government was going to use this against them.</text>

            <text syncTime="674.313" offset="2697195">One of the people that’s been indicted, Mr. Jerome Zarowitz, was formerly Executive Vice President of a hotel called Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.351" offset="2733349">Mr. Parnas is an accountant who works in New York for Caesars Palace, so, so far as we can determine, there is -- there is some connection between what the grand juries indicted about and what they want to ask Mr. Parnas about.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.131" offset="2804506">With respect to Mr. Gelbard, the questions asked that are reproduced in the appendix focus on the allegation to put it bluntly that he was the bagman carrying the proceeds of illegal interstate gaming between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.</text>

            <text syncTime="788.734" offset="3154860">The Fourth Amendment, Mr. Chief Justice is not designed solely to protect guilty criminals and those who fear the Government is going to prove that they are guilty criminals, and Mr. Parnas and Mr. Gelbard are seeking an application of their Fourth Amendment rights in the context of this proceeding, which will vindicate their right of privacy, a right which is available to them whether or not they fear prosecution and whether or not they are granted immunity from prosecution by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.330" offset="3285264">They are thus, in no different position from any person, who invokes a privacy protecting privilege, in front of the grand jury, regardless of whether he fears prosecution by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.433" offset="3345659">Perhaps I can use an analogy if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.597" offset="3358302">Let us assume, that the FBI, through stealth, listened beyond on a conversation between a penitent and a priest engaged in the ritual of the confession and that thereafter, the government called the penitent before a grand jury and sought to interrogate him or her about what had been heard in the confessional.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.427" offset="3461642">In such a case, if the Government indicated any intention to use the transcript that the FBI agents over hearing to refresh the penitent’s recollection about what she or he had told the priest.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.778" offset="3519112">A fair reading of the clergyman penitent privilege, at least at it appears in such statements as that in the proposed federal rules of evidence, would it seems to me permit the witness to interpose this privacy protecting privilege, and so here, where the intrusion is illegal, under the 1968 Act, and the Government admits that it intends to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.492" offset="3613884">We say that the law, the right of privacy protects, and of course we supplement that by saying that irrespective of any Fifth Amendment problems, the statute forbids these material to be used in a way that the Government plans to use it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1027.498" offset="4109897">Now, to all of this, the Government replies what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.847" offset="4131318">That the rule which the prior decisions of this Court and plain meaning of the act established, would impose too heavy a burden on the administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.637" offset="4174472">There are two answers to this contention, first, that it isn’t true and second, we invite to Court to think of the alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.839" offset="4207282">This was a tap under the provisions of the 1968 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.506" offset="4222015">The 1968 Act, if the District Judge orders it, gives persons overheard in these taps the right to be notified for the fact they have been overheard, thus, it requires the Government to keep records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.570" offset="4278230">Government says in its brief that in the remand in the Alderman case, they spent 20 man-days searching through the records to see whether or not the petitioners there had been overheard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.529" offset="4318041">I can understand that, this Court knows from bitter experience how difficult it was to ferried out taps that the FBI had conducted and subsequently attempted to hide even attorneys in the Justice Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.614" offset="4366420">But under the 1968 Act, all of that is supposed to be over, there supposed to be records kept and so the note is giving function that the act makes a crucial part of its protection, of the rights of the individual can be adhered to and complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.800" offset="4447190">There is finally, or second rather, the gratuitous assertion that these petitioners are not trying to protect their rights, they are trying to shield somebody else that if they’re really concerned about themselves, they’d invoke the Fifth Amendment like good citizens and not worry about all these privacy argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.948" offset="4539768">They seek, as I have mentioned before to protect their own right of privacy as Chief Judge Sobeloff said, in the case of Lankford versus Gelston, upholding the use of the federal equity powered issue and injunction against illegal search, it would be a grotesque irony if our courts protect only against the unlawful search which uncovers contraband, by the exclusionary rule, while offering no relief against an admittedly unlawful pattern and practice, affecting hundreds of innocent homeowners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.604" offset="4666410">Thus, we are saying here that the privacy protecting job of protecting Federal District Court isn’t limited to saying that contraband seized from somebody who is proven guilty by the fact the contraband was seized, ought not to be received in evidence, that the privacy protecting function arises anytime a citizen is about to be the victim of an invasion of privacy directed against him or her, the Government said in Alderman and then said it in this Court and through the words of the Solicitor General that it was concerned about people like petitioners, third parties wander in the taps, that have been authorized against somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.710" offset="4842789">We invite the Government in this case to share that concern that we have about these third parties under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.576" offset="4882286">These are not, if the Court please, the times of the assize Clarendon in which grand juror sat under a tree and gossiped about breaches of the king’s peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.626" offset="4930456">The grand jury is a formidable force, with the power to call on many investigative agencies to pull people off the streets and compel them to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.635" offset="4970475">It may be used for investigation and as a dress rehearsal for the Government’s case in chief of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.227" offset="4992836">It is the sole inquisitorial element, in an accusatorial system of jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.431" offset="5021675">There must be limits on its power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.954" offset="5031811">Yes, those limits may slow down the process some, as we say in our brief, due process is always slower than summary process or drumhead process or pistol at the head process or as in this case no process at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.213" offset="5100774">In conclusion, we say only that a great deal has been written and more said about the way of recent congressional legislation on crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.780" offset="5139017">Many see in these statutes an unyielding hostility to civil liberty, but however these laws may fair here, when measured against the constitution, this Court should surely set its phase against any attempt, as in this case, to read out of those statutes the precious few concessions to personal freedom, which they indisputably contain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.771" offset="5223027">The Government’s position here, if the Court please is sabotaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.916" offset="5239641">It is sabotaged of the 1968 Act, sabotaged of a 170 years of this Court’s decision and sabotaged of the rights of liberty and personal security.</text>

            <text syncTime="1331.090" offset="5324278">We think the starting point in this case, should be the law as it existed prior to the 1968 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.315" offset="5357192">Our position in this case is that prior to that law, it was well settled that a witness before a grand jury could not challenge before being required to give testimony before that grand jury, either the evidence which led the grand jury to summon him or the evidence which was proposed to be used before the grand jury in examining him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.641" offset="5450501">And our position furthermore is that Congress cannot be deemed to have changed this well-settled principle without some clear expression, indicating that it intended to do so in the 1968 Act and then we looked at the 1968 Act, we think, not only does that act not show any congressional decision to change it but on the contrary, it affirmatively shows an intention to continue that rule and not to permit witnesses before a grand jury, to challenge the evidence before the grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.921" offset="5799602">They said we have a right not to testify before the grand jury until we can first determine whether or not, the evidence which the grand jury proposed to use in either examining the witnesses which led the grand jury to call the witnesses was the product of illegal electronic surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.541" offset="5874103">They want to litigate out before testifying the question whether or not there was improper electronic surveillance relating to them and our basic submission to this Court is that they do not have the right to do that, that that is an issue they can raise only if and when the evidence is sought to be used against them, against them in a criminal proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1539.312" offset="6157166">They can claim personal privilege if they claim that the answers to these questions would tend to incriminate them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.370" offset="6185378">If they claim that the answer to the question would violate any of the traditional privileges, such as lawyer-client privilege, they can refuse to answer on that ground but we say they cannot refuse to answer on the ground that there was a prior, illegal electronic surveillance which either led the grand jury to call them on the basis of which they would be questioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1668.394" offset="6673554">Well, we think a permissible privilege is a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and what I would call the personal privileges where, in contrast to the giving of the testimony which relates back to an illegal, allegedly illegal search and seizure, where the mere giving of the testimony itself reaches the privilege, that is in the case for example the lawyer-client communication, the privilege is breached.</text>

            <text syncTime="1943.727" offset="7774877">I’d like to discuss briefly the Silverthorne case because we think that is a different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.886" offset="7795461">What happened in the Silverthorne case was that the Silverthorne’s had been indicted and after they have been indicted and arrested the government officials without any authority at all just came into their house and made a complete swift of all their personal property they took all the books and records and brought it in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.207" offset="7864738">And these people in turn went to the District Court and got a court order directing the return of this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.085" offset="7900264">The court holding that the property had been illegally seized from the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.546" offset="7918132">After that a new grand jury was convened which was investigating other violations of the law by the same individuals and what the new grand jury did was to issue a subpoena for the identical books and records that have previously have been taking and have been ordered returned and this Court in a landmark opinion refused to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.162" offset="8012591">It refused to do so I think not passing any general principal that whenever a witness is called before a grand jury he has the right to contest the way in which the grand jury called him but rather on the particular circumstances as case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.779" offset="8083017">Silverthorne is a three-page opinion of Justice Holmes as written in his usual tight style and what he said I think reveals very clearly what was the matter with this case, I think he explained the government contention as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.317" offset="8145189">He said the Government’s contention is that although of course its seizure was in outrage which the government now regrets, it may copy the papers, use the knowledge as obtained and compel production again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.805" offset="8191164">I think the Silverthorne case is the unusual situation where you just had quite outrageous conduct where you had a search that had previously been judicially determined to be illegal and then the government just around and said, well we don’t have to pay any attention to that we can undercut that determination of illegality by just calling the records back before another grand jury under a new subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.483" offset="8289907">And this Court very properly refused to countenance that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.771" offset="8303073">This case it seems to us is the antithesis of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.059" offset="8312163">This is a case in which the surveillance was made pursuant to a Court Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.228" offset="8344869">There’s no allegation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.347" offset="8349362">There’s no determination here that there was anything illegal about the surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.703" offset="8362736">They now claim the surveillance as illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.980" offset="8371827">They now object to the surveillance but it seems to us, this is a very different situation from what you had in Silverthorne.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.941" offset="8395755">Silverthorne is of course relied on by both the petitioners in this case and the respondents in the next case as announcing this broad rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.012" offset="8428042">We think Silverthorne turns on its particular facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.431" offset="8441626">That Silverthorne does not announce this broad rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.870" offset="8455419">The rule, the rule has been an ordinarily that a grand jury may consider any evidence it has however it came into the grand jury’s possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.497" offset="8493976">This court repeatedly as recognized that a defendant in a criminal case cannot challenge the indictment on the ground that improper evidence was produced before the grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2440.907" offset="9763527">And the Senate Committee also said that Section 2518 (10) later on when it came to discuss that must be read in connection with Section 2515 which it limits in other words the right provided in Section 2515 is limited by the standing provided in Section 2515 is limited by the standing provided in Section 2518 (10) and it also said that this latter section subsection 10 provides the remedy for the right created in Section 2515.</text>

            <text syncTime="2482.616" offset="9930397">The list of proceedings before which a motion to suppress may be made is the same as that in 2515 with two striking exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.494" offset="9965923">There’s no provision made in that for a grand jury proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2582.480" offset="10329861">The provision does not envision the making of a motion to suppress in the context of such a proceeding itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.685" offset="10358700">Normally, there’s no limitation on the character of evidence that may be presented to a grand jury which is enforceable by an individual citing Blue against United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2722.331" offset="10889300">Now I would also like to turn to another provision of the statute which reflects the same intention on the part of Congress and that is subsection 9 in the middle of page 20 which has been referred to excess the contents of any interception -- intercepted wire communication shall not be received in evidence or otherwise disclose in any trial hearing or other proceeding unless each party is given 10 days notice there if not, two things about the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.137" offset="11004447">It spokes -- speaks of trial hearing or other proceeding and it speaks of a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.572" offset="11026286">Ordinarily, a witness is not viewed as a party before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.678" offset="11046661">The word party as we used it in our law means parties to a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.595" offset="11070380">And once again the legislative history the Senate Report confirms to that view because in speaking of paragraph 9, what the Senate Committee says is proceeding is intended to include all adversary tight hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.332" offset="11129313">It would include a trial itself a probation revocation proceeding or a hearing on a motion for reduction of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.163" offset="11164630">It would include a grand jury hearing citing again Blue against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.419" offset="11193574">So once again it seems to us that the legislative history of these provisions is as clear as can be, that Congress did not intend by these words to give any rights to a witness before a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.096" offset="11252297">This suggestion has been made both in this case and in the following case that this statute is so clear on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.686" offset="11282704">That no resort need be had to the legislative history, it is clear on its face they say because they look to the definition of aggrieve party and they say that the people who’ve been overheard come within the definition of aggrieve party therefore that is the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.725" offset="11342890">Well, this is a very complicated statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.919" offset="11351667">It occupies, a text to this Title alone occupies 23 or 24 of the printed pages in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.006" offset="11379984">It’s a statute that is certainly not clear on its face.It’s difficult to know what these things mean and I think it is essential in this case to have resort to the legislative history to ascertain precisely what Congress was seeking to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.883" offset="11431497">Precisely what rights Congress was giving to this people whether Congress was intending for the first time to give witnesses before the grand jury the right to challenge the introduction of evidence before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.796" offset="11499102">Now as I have indicated a Congress did not leave witnesses in this situation without a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.975" offset="11527837">Congress provided an unusual thing, it provide a specific suit for damages in Section 2520 of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.350" offset="11561378">And this provision would permit a witness if he has in fact been injured by an illegal surveillance to recover damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.628" offset="11594501">Indeed, it’s a rather unusual provision because it permits punitive damages, not only actual damages and attorney’s fees but punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.213" offset="11632849">Now with this as far as the 1968 Act is concerned, I would like to turn to another provision which is a provision of the Second statute, the 1970 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.314" offset="11689169">The claim has been made that even if the 1968 statute perhaps did not give these witnesses any rights, nevertheless, the 1970 statute did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.049" offset="11736189">And that is a provision Section 3504 and that provision was the reaction to this congressional reaction to this Court’s decision in the Alderman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.675" offset="11790629">Congress was concerned that as the result of the Alderman decision there would be an enormous increase in the number of hearings required in court to litigate all of his claims of illegal electronic surveillance and Congress attempted to reduce the number of those hearings and what Congress did in this Section and it can be found at page, the end of our brief in the Egan in this case -- Sorry none of our brief in the Egan --</text>

            <text syncTime="3022.198" offset="12088738">They shall not be required any hearing with respect to the validity of that surveillance unless the information brought to bear may be relevant to the claim of inadmissibility of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.399" offset="12145580">That was, I read congressional concern that people would make all sorts of allegations that they may have been some kind of a taint and that as a result of that taint, the evidence would be rendered and admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.385" offset="12193437">Then they went on beyond that and said that in any of that if there was electronic surveillance before the June 1968 date and the surveillance occurred more than five years prior to the conduct to this -- at issue on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.139" offset="12264490">There was to be no consideration otherwise any possible taint of an electronics surveillance that occurred more than five years before the time at which the evidence of violation -- evidence of violations involved that was to attenuate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.873" offset="12323422">So it started that was the basic purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.609" offset="12334393">Then, what its said was in any trial, hearing or other proceeding you know before any court, grand jury etcetera, etcetera.</text>

            <text syncTime="3094.893" offset="12379533">It does not include the word legislative committee and it says upon a claim by a party aggrieved that evidence is inadmissible because it is the primary product of an unlawful act and unlawful act is defined in the statute to mean electronic surveillance the government shall affirm or deny that allegation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3132.237" offset="12528849">The Government’s positions seems to be that only if the legislative history is ambiguous need we read the statute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.506" offset="12561972">I invite the Court’s attention first to Section 2515 of the statute which is at page 8 of the appendix of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.367" offset="12597394">That section forbids receipt in evidence in any trial, hearing or other proceeding in or before any grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.817" offset="12631249">A certain evidence if disclosure would be in violation of this chapter apart of the this chapter to which that statute refers is surely Section 2511 which makes it a criminal offense to disclose information obtained in violation of the Crime Control and Safe Streets Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.194" offset="12732709">Particularly, Section 2511 subdivision 1 (c) reprinted at page 5 of the appendix of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.370" offset="12773460">So there is in 2515 not just a right but a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.226" offset="12796865">Now, the legislative history if the Court please, does say that Section 2518 subdivision 10 of the statute which has to do with notice and hearing is not intended to apply to a grand jury proceeding and it cites the case of Blue versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.992" offset="12875964">We do not contest the holding in Blue in this proceeding.</text>
