            <text syncTime="39.629" offset="232239">The estate planners have long sort of method whereby majority owners of closely held corporate stock could maintain control of their corporations throughout their lifetimes but nevertheless be able to pass on their businesses a debt without payment of estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.040" offset="309875">This federal estate tax case presents an attempt which has less far been successful to achieve these two most desirable goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.552" offset="347909">Here, the method employed was a transfer of a portion of the majority owner stock into a trust with the owner retaining a sure lifetime control of these corporations by reserving the right to vote the stock he transferred in trust and the right to veto any sale of that stock by the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.198" offset="434427">We brought this case hereon certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit because of our concern with its effect on the administration of the federal estate tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.852" offset="481134">The specific facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.294" offset="490851">The decedent, Mr. Byrum owned controlling stock interest in three corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.456" offset="519481">Late in 1958, he created an irrevocable trust naming a bank as trustee to which he there have to transferred stock in the three corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.618" offset="568174">The trustee had power until Mr. Byrum’s youngest child reached the age 21 to distribute trust income and principal to the beneficiaries in its discretion when the youngest child reached age 21, separate trusts would be establish for each child or for the surviving issue of any deceased child.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.561" offset="655945">Each child’s separate trust was to terminate when that child reached age 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.851" offset="685098">The trust instruments specifically provided that Mr. Byrum would retain for his lifetime, the right to vote all unlisted stocks such as the stock in the three corporations he transferred and the right to veto sale of that stock by the trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.391" offset="763256">On page 4 of our opening brief, there appears a small chart showing the percentage of each corporation’s stock owned by Mr. Byrum and by the trust at the time of Mr. Byrum’s death.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.469" offset="827517">In the case of the first corporation which is Byrum Lithographing Company, you can see that the total originally owned by Mr. Byrum was 71% of the corporation’s stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.095" offset="890107">He transferred 12% of the stock in trust and retained 59% in his own name.</text>

            <text syncTime="2166.183" offset="8738440">Under the law of Ohio and under the General Corporation Law, he stood in a fiduciary relationship to these corporations and to all of the stockholders of the corporations and significantly that all three of these corporations, there was a minority stock holder outstanding or minority stock interest outstanding who was not related to Mr. Byrum, was not a member of his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.382" offset="8835197">And we submit that he could not regulated the dividend flow from these corporations to suit his personal interest, his private purpose without violating his position of trust and question arose as to what objective standard is there to hold the majority stock holder and the directors to the objective standard is this, I think quite clearly that this is corporation law is that the stockholders are entitled of the profits of the corporation other than those profits which are reasonably needed for the business and the question of what profits are reasonably needed for the business is a question that’s answered constantly by the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.282" offset="9030802">And it is of course the very question which is involved and the corporate accumulated earnings tax which was referred to by Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.129" offset="9070195">So, they’re very definitely is an objective standard to which a majority stockholder is held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.284" offset="9098825">Indeed, in many respects I think it’s more objective, more restrictive than is some of the (inaudible), some of the standards supposedly imposed upon trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.533" offset="9151801">Quite clearly, it is not a matter of the good faith of the majority stockholder or a majority or the board of trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.379" offset="9195165">There’s an objective standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.204" offset="9202479">They are obligated to pay out the profits of the corporation unless there is a reason on business need to retain these profits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2300.325" offset="9274995">Well, I think the purpose of Mr., but frankly, I think the purpose of Mr. Byrum and understand I did not know him and was not around when the trust was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.550" offset="9315850">I think his purpose was to attempt to hold the corporation together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.291" offset="9334868">I think a small corporation has extreme disadvantage or an older having an interest in a small corporation or larger corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.895" offset="9369245">You can give extensive stock to a large listed corporation away without a danger of having the corporation collapse but this was a small everyday kind of a business and I think he was concerned about the business judgments that a bank would make or a successor trustee which would have to be a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.690" offset="9456389">So an answer to your question, I think he was concerned about the business judgments that might occur if the right to vote the stock was given of the national bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.721" offset="9504559">And frankly, I don’t agree with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.972" offset="9509575">I think that I don’t know how these other places but in Columbus, Ohio, we probably didn’t have to do that, I’m sure the bank would’ve call them and said Mr. Byrum how do you want us to vote the stock, but that is in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.830" offset="9557013">Unfortunately, he did retain the right to vote the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.367" offset="9579165">But focusing again on the statute which we can’t get away from section 2036 (a) (2), I don’t really think in the circumstances of Byrum that there’s any shifting of corporate income or rather of dividend income by the payment or the withholding of dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.876" offset="9681147">If dividends are declared, they are paid under the terms of this trust, unequivocally to the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.136" offset="9702254">Mr. Byrum had nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.423" offset="9711344">They were subject to being withdraw on the terms of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.458" offset="9723465">He had no control of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.026" offset="9733810">If dividends were withheld as a results of legitimate business decision, how can you say there’s any shifting of income if they were withheld partially or totally because of his private motives then the minority stockholders had redressed in the Court and indeed under those circumstances, I think the trustee himself would be obligated to take action because after all he is representing the stockholders, the beneficiary of this trust.</text>

            <text syncTime="2520.883" offset="10157202">But the issue common to Reinecke and common to Byrum is this overly back up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.007" offset="10185728">The specific question in Reinecke was whether these powers to the set law of supervising an investment of the trust and both the stock held in trust whether this constituted the gift of the corpus of the trust; a gift intended to take effect at or after death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.960" offset="10253542">Now, that the rule of Reinecke is that this kind of administrative power did not delay possession or enjoyment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.179" offset="10294397">It did not delay the vesting of possession or enjoyment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.102" offset="10314041">The question is here does the same kind of a power cause a shifting of possession or enjoyment and by apparently of reason if it does not constituted delay of possession or enjoyment, it doesn’t constitute shifting of possession or enjoyment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.011" offset="10385721">I think the Reinecke and all the cases, the lower court cases that have been decided after Reinecke and followed Reinecke stand or as a complete bar to the position of the government here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.370" offset="10439116">They have as you point out attempted to this discount it because it was an active before the predecessor to Section 2036 (a) (2) but the fact to the matter is there is a common thread in Reinecke and in Byrum.</text>

            <text syncTime="2673.689" offset="10768468">I would like the direct the attention just briefly to the Government’s reply brief and it seems to me in it’s reply brief, the Government backs off of its earlier position, this is my opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.994" offset="10829699">They take a new track and say that actually Byrum is disposed of by the president of three cases decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.778" offset="10860837">The one being the O’Malley case that we discussed here and the other is Commissioner versus Estate of Holmes and Lober versus U.S., and they also suggest or it seems to me, that we didn’t cite these cases if we were trying to avoid them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.836" offset="10921023">And we didn’t cite them but we’re not trying to avoid them because on this point we agree with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.256" offset="10942652">We think these three cases do invite comparison with Byrum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.540" offset="10959788">We’ve compared O’Malley and as you will recall in Holmes and in Lober.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.155" offset="10994270">The set law reserved the right to terminate the trust in those two situations before the specified termination date and thereby to cutoff the contingent remainder interest and as compared to Byrum, we think clearly here in Lober and in Holmes is the situation where the set law held a conscious, a permissive and open choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.975" offset="11113597">He had an open power to directly affect the beneficiaries of those two trusts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.223" offset="11134600">This is not the case in Byrum, the government has to look to some subjective consideration about stock manipulation or dividend manipulation in order to get to where it is now and we submit that this ought not to be made the basis of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.322" offset="11210982">The government is also somewhere in one of its briefs indicated that if Byrum is not reversed that there will be a great deal of litigation to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.428" offset="11259361">And I think frankly just the opposite is true, I think it’s been demonstrative by the argument here today that Byrum is just one step in the Government’s plan to expand Section 2036 and I supposed then 2038 because if I understood correctly in the argument here, I don’t think even a trust will stand in the way of the Government search to tax this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.365" offset="11379106">And I would simply say you in conclusion that if these are situations, if Byrum represents a situation that an equity dictates that there should be a tax and I don’t think it is but assuming that that’s true that I submit to you, it’s for the Congress to enact the statutes to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.911" offset="11477326">It’s not taxable under the present laws and I submit in all do respect that should not be made taxable by this Court but should be left in the congress.</text>
