            <text syncTime="52.147" offset="282601">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.144" offset="294512">This is an appeal from a Three-Judge District Court of the Middle District of Tennessee and I suppose to struck down the durational residency requirements for voting as provided by the State Constitution and implemented by statues of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.764" offset="381030">The time fixed in Tennessee for durational residency requirements was one year in the State and three months in the County for the person offers himself to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.159" offset="438604">The question presented is whether or not such constitutional and statutory provisions violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and whether or not in determining this, the doctrine of irrational or unreasonable or the compelling state interest doctrine is to be made applicable in this kind of a case in part of determination of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.890" offset="553543">At the time, this case was decided by the District Court and so far as this counsel has any way of ascertaining now, 33 states and three territories had the durational residence requirements of at least the one year as the case in Tennessee; 15 states had a six-month residency requirement which is double to the county residence requirement provided for in the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.182" offset="674751">The remaining two states had respectfully 190 days and the other three months the residency requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.562" offset="700246">Mr. Roberts, have there been any studies made on a widespread or even a national basis to determine how long it takes to pack up registration and that sort of thing to check out to be sure that the voters are voting in two states.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_roberts" startTime="178.018" stopTime="285.821">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="178.018" offset="786032">No sir, not to my knowledge, if Your Honor please, that is where we think that the District Court erred in trying to make such a determination based on the registration cutoff deadline of 30 days, which implies in Tennessee and in most of the states that have registration laws, but, it is our insistence that the Court was in error there because that cutoff period is designed specifically and it is very clearly shown in the law to be for the purpose of permitting the county election officials, the necessary time to make the administrative acts that they are required to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.577" offset="940259">For example, they have to take your master registration list and break that down precinct by precinct and make duplicates of it throughout to the precinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.331" offset="979339">They got to run their advertisements and the paper notices of the election, select all of the judges and officers to hold the election at the precinct level and it is countless number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.420" offset="1019672">No word during that period of time can be Election Commission in Tennessee and I think it is generally true at everywhere else use that period of time to purge an ineligible voter.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.472" offset="1071917">Therefore the durational residency requirement is necessary, we feel, in order to give some time for which the Election Commission can get rid of any ineligible voters, purge them as the case might be, and then, the 30-day registration cutoff only for administrative period and things alone, because somewhere there has got to be a period of time when the voter knows that he is going to be entitled to go to the booth and vote and that is what we think the 30 days is for.</text>

            <text syncTime="315.734" offset="1336903">Well, Tennessee, if Your Honor please, already had done this before the 1970 Voting Rights Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.363" offset="1363443">That is one of the things that I wanted to point out to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.617" offset="1376504">There are other ways of doing it besides in effect reinterpreting the Fourteenth Amendment in order to bring it about.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.687" offset="1416733">In Tennessee, anybody that moves within a precinct or anywhere else in the state has 90 days in which to qualify himself in the new area or until that period of time, he can go back and vote where he had always voted either in person or by absentee ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.216" offset="1502832">He is never disfranchised.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.263" offset="1511087">The same is true so far as the year and the state is concerned by act -- legislature even before the 1970 Voting Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.160" offset="1546614">We provided that in Tennessee any person who live in that state would maintain his domicile, which in Tennessee is the same as legal residence, he would maintain that domicile until such time as he acquired a new one and no matter what state he went to.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.797" offset="1617144">And, we think that that is an essential way of doing it, so that you are protecting the people that usually would have the most standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.217" offset="1654865">It takes some little time.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.545" offset="1660194">I think the Court can take a notice of the fact that a person who has lived a number of years in a county and then he moves, it is a little while that he would prefer to be identified back where he had been for any period of time as opposed to immediately entering into the political arena in a new place.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.531" offset="1792060">The problem with this though if you go to confine it through registration deadline, for example, as it is determining, whether or not the person really is a bona fide resident of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.481" offset="1855903">Now, the District Court in striking down a year and the state and the three months in the county, did indicate that they felt that the 30-day registration deadline was sufficient to accomplish this, and it then argued in opposing counsel’s brief that anybody that would go into the registrar’s office and be willing to make an oath that he is a bona fide resident would also be willing to make an oath and swear a lie about anything else that would be necessary to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.403" offset="1999577">But, that does not follow because it is nebulas sort of thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.607" offset="5244403">We would respectfully insist that all of the previous cases are on the appellant side in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.246" offset="5282960">Not only of the cases that I have cited but where this Court dealt directly with the proposition, but also, on interpreting provisions under the Tenth Amendment and in other cases, this Court has used the durational residency requirement or residency power of a state for voting as example, a state power that still left to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.906" offset="5385569">Now, that was true in Kramer versus Union Free School District as late as in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.096" offset="5446382">The only thing that the US District Court could have gotten their key from was when this Court granted their noted proper jurisdiction in Hall versus Beals coming out in Colorado which later was dismissed as being moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.669" offset="5516703">Now, there was no other law that the District Courts could be using out of that their second guess in this Court, and, that is all -- all the basis or authority that they could have for hold in a way to have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.409" offset="5599668">I just want to say one other thing in that and I am going to close and that is, in 1970, Mr. Chief Justice in the Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York quoted from the old Jackman case where Mr. Justice Holmes said that “If a thing has been practiced for 200 years but common can certainly lead a strong case for the Fourteenth Amendment to affect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.234" offset="5718891">We think that is what you have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.874" offset="5725474">You have all of the states fixing residential or residency requirements and it has been that way for a long time and it is not -- it is not just antiquated provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.302" offset="5783152">In the case of Tennessee, (Inaudible) point this out, the adversary counsel insists and the Court has even handed tort in their opinion that the registration laws took the place of the residency requirements in Tennessee and that that was a stated purpose and it was a later law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.948" offset="5853788">Well, that is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.486" offset="5859952">In 1953, it is when the people had the chance to relook at the durational residency requirement provision in Tennessee and their constitution, and they did retain the one year in the state, but it was at that time that the six months in the county was lowered to three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.240" offset="5938947">So, that that is not an antiquated provision and it is one the clearly shows that the people want in their constitutions some protection against voter fraud and that they put it in there after they had registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.091" offset="5994326">There could be no serious argument that the registration law and the 30-day cutoff there did away or just does away with any purpose to be served by durational residency requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.983" offset="6041869">So, that just is not the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1518.121" offset="6146463">I think it is important to understand that the first measure that this case does not involve the question of residency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.167" offset="6178646">There is no question in this case that I am a bona fide resident of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.546" offset="6196201">The state has conceded this throughout and the District Court found this as a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.303" offset="6215218">There is no question that I meet the standards of domicile that Tennessee imposes as its standard residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.267" offset="6239041">So, the state’s argument entirely has been pitched to the fact that there is a question of residency here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.440" offset="6263701">This is not a question of residency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.352" offset="6271433">This is a question of an additional separate factor and that is a calendar waiting period beyond the bona fide residency criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.402" offset="6303616">There is currently in Tennessee -- the Law Revision Commission of Tennessee is currently under a mandate of the legislature to revise the Election Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.569" offset="6336217">And a specific section of that tentative draft of the revision goes to the question of defining bona fide residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.416" offset="6367668">Tennessee is now planning to adapt the standards of New Mexico setting out several indicia in criteria of determining bona fide residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.311" offset="6403195">Duration of residence is a separate category; it is not within one of these factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.154" offset="6422630">So, I just want to make that perfectly clear at the outset.</text>

            <text syncTime="1633.927" offset="6609667">First, there is a 30-day cutoff period for registration.</text>

            <label>Mr. James F. Blumstein</label>
            <text syncTime="1644.866" offset="6653448">If a person comes in to the State of Tennessee and establishes its domicile, according to the relevant tennessee standards, you would look at whether he has become a domicile for tax purpose, you would look at whether he becomes a domicile for purposes of his driver’s license, his automobile registration and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.772" offset="6721053">If he meets those criteria, either separate independent criteria that the election commission and the county registrars are entitled to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.162" offset="6750623">If after their investigation at the time of registration, it is their conclusion that a new resident is a bona fide resident, then, it is my contention that there is a discrimination that this Court must then review under the compelling interest standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.098" offset="6806421">Just showing the discrimination, Your Honor, is not the answer to a constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.473" offset="6823871">At that point, it triggers a strict constitutional standard of review and then we must go into the policy questions that the state articulates to support this discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.489" offset="6859920">So, my answer to your question then is, yes, it does trigger strict review and know that the state does not meet -</text>

            <text syncTime="1714.246" offset="6930973">And, I point out that as a matter of law while apart from these evidentiary indicia having to do with driver’s licenses and taxes and so on, as a matter, well-established law, a person can become a resident of the state -- a new resident of a state in a matter of minutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1744.112" offset="7050405">And there are other classes of people perhaps in certain situations that may be able to -- the state may be able to discriminate against as far as the franchise is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.757" offset="7097007">For example, many states discriminate against felons who have already been convicted, and even though they are bona fide residents, they may be eliminated from the franchise.</text>

            <text syncTime="2281.323" offset="9199237">It might be interesting to add that Tennessee was a major political battle ground in 1970 where a former Senator Gore was defeated by the incumbent Senator Brock.</text>

            <text syncTime="2292.818" offset="9245213">And since this decision was one of the earliest handed down by the District Court involving durational residency, there was no question that it got widespread dissemination among all the neighboring states in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.586" offset="9296308">And, there was ample opportunity with colonization of the other fraudulent devices of the state it refers to, and there was no evidence whatsoever and it was reported to me of any problems in this regards, to be sure that the registrar of Davidson County did make the statement that she would have to ensure a bicycle rack in front of her county courthouse, but this is the kind of armchair assertion that is not backed up by any data at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.707" offset="9400798">There was no evidence whatsoever of fraud; there was no data that the State has brought to bear on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.859" offset="9441445">In discussing the constitutional claim, it is essential to look at the alternatives that the State has in order to prevent frauds, since we seem to have focused on fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.631" offset="9488465">The voter registration system was not -- statewide voter registration did not come in being in Tennessee until 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.720" offset="9520857">The expressed purpose of voter registration, as stated in the statute, is to protect the purity of the ballot.</text>

            <text syncTime="2373.101" offset="9566415">There is no interest that the State is protecting by duration of residency that cannot be protected in determining bona fide residents at the time of registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.754" offset="9601001">There is no additional protection that the period of durational residency provides at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.864" offset="9621481">And the state -- just this morning in fact, in discussing the need to purge voters and so forth, does not go to the question of why at the time of registration, the state cannot make the determination of bona fide residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.373" offset="9671531">This is the role of registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.919" offset="9681667">In fact, there are figures to indicate that the system of voter registration itself has raised a great obstacle for Voter Turnout.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.957" offset="9717820">Voter Turnout in the last three presidential elections did not match at all with what Voter Turnout was prior to voter registration law has been enacted and there is the study that shows, in the 1880’s and 1890’s, voter participation was at a much higher level than voter participation is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.039" offset="9786157">Now appellee does not argue that voter registration is an impermissible bar in the franchise, but, what the appellee does asserts is the only justification for this disfranchisement is that it does not prevent voter fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="2591.278" offset="10439113">Mr. Roberts, in his argument, mentioned the concepts of line drawing and whether this was an appropriate judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.461" offset="10479864">In this case, the District Court did not attempt to draw a line as to a permissible duration of residency period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.532" offset="10512152">It said that this was an impermissible -- in position regardless of how long the line was provided that discriminated in the way that we were talking about it, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.400" offset="10563561">As far as colonization argument is concerned, the State protects its interest against fraud in several ways as far in the criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.068" offset="10598251">There is a specific provision of the Tennessee Code Section 2-2209 which makes the colonization a criminal penalty, a felony and poses a minimum term of two years and a maximum term of five years for bringing voters from out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.711" offset="10668782">There are similar provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.591" offset="10676305">Tennessee Code 2-1614, makes it a felony to vote when note legally entitled and there are other provisions in the Tennessee Code which make it a misdemeanor to vote when note legally entitled to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.892" offset="10733566">Moreover, there are the possibilities of purchase, as Mr. Roberts mentions, is another way of assuring of this interest that the state has in maintaining the purity of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.041" offset="10774108">Also, Tennessee provides for a challenge system at the polls for people who are not bona fide residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.581" offset="10796259">This is another way that the state’s interest can be protected in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.127" offset="10818516">In short, these durational residency requirements had nothing in a significant way towards improving the states purity of the election system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2778.725" offset="11188932">Mr. Pope was a resident of the State of Maryland for beyond -- for more than the duration of residency provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2787.709" offset="11224772">And, what he was challenging was the specific statute that required him to state his intent to become a resident one year in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.948" offset="11257791">I just think that factual distinction is worth making at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.535" offset="11296139">The State, in its brief, has also asserted another interest and this is a knowledgeability, learning about the local community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.047" offset="11338143">I think that the point that I raised before about the domicile requirement is worth mentioning here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.949" offset="11361758">There is no requirement, for example, in Tennessee that you physically be present in the state during the period of this duration of residency.</text>

            <text syncTime="2983.235" offset="12006878">In sum, the State has not shown its interest in this case; it is compelling that the durational residency requirements are required to prevent fraud or to ensure knowledgeability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.044" offset="12058183">The case falls comfortably within the rationale that this Court has articulated in the Kramer case and within the Shapiro against Thompson case as far as interstate travel is concerned.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Roberts</label>
            <text syncTime="3042.609" offset="12244383">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.526" offset="12260057">One of things I wish to point out is the distinction that adversary counsel has attempted to make between the time elements of durational residence in saying that 30 days, there would be no discrimination but somehow rather, reading into it, that 90 days in the county would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.195" offset="12346783">I submit that there is no discrimination there as found in the Burg case coming out of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.011" offset="12378026">This would be applicable thereby that there is no discrimination at all, and if anybody whether he had lived in the state before or not, after three months in the county where he proposes to vote, would be entitled to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.046" offset="12426196">Now a little better case could be made out on the hype of what he has alleged in regard to the one year in the State, because there you could be discriminated against just by the virtue of the fact that you lived across a state line or even though you worked back and fourth during the year and then moved in for the three months preceding an election and satisfied the country requirement, but would not have satisfied the state requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.206" offset="12558793">Now, there was one other thing that I did wish to point out to the Court, and that is the obvious intent of Congress in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.934" offset="12589722">And that is the Court as to where the 1970 Voting Rights Act amendment originally contained the provision that would have abolished the durational residency requirements in all elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.187" offset="12654715">It was Congress’s decision to remove that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.699" offset="12664746">They rejected this proposal, yet despite that, somehow rather our District Court, in its opinion, has read into that an interpretation that Congress really is supporting the proposition of abolishing residency requirement when actually they had it in their bill and then took it out on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.731" offset="12772893">At Page 9 of his brief, the appellee, in discussing whether or not voter waiting period is beneficial in weeding out ineligible voters, concludes that anyone who is willing to swear falsely that he is an ineligible voter would is just as readily swear falsely that he had been in the state for a year and then a county for three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.367" offset="12847499">Well, that just does not necessarily follow at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.613" offset="12864426">The second oath could be proven much more easily than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.847" offset="12885324">All of the precinct workers at an election are local to the voting precincts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.232" offset="12910924">The judges and officers and all are local people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.901" offset="12929628">For purposes of identity, they can challenge any voter that comes up even on election day, if they have an opportunity to know that that person has not been in the community that long, they can challenge him and the election commission decide itself then whether he really is entitled to cast that ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.098" offset="13002352">But, there is no other way except for having a time element involved in the community, I submit, that for the local people to be able to pull out the illegal voter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.177" offset="13058672">Now this could be a very serious thing in connection with the question of mobility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.457" offset="13087825">That is a two-way sword.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.899" offset="13093572">Not only there are lot more people moving intrastate and interstate as a result of the type of society that we now have, but that also goes the other way too and it offers an opportunity for a type of fraud that before could not have existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.788" offset="13157102">I submit that (Inaudible) in his state and my state would have had a field day out of a 30-day cutoff deadline and no other resident requirements for voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.485" offset="13207884">That is just the way it works.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.240" offset="13222930">I had the opportunity a few years ago to be an state election coordinator in my home state, and while at that, I organized the statewide association of county election commissioners, and I have heard every kind of complaints and I submit that if there is any way of stealing election, somebody has got a way to figure out how to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.004" offset="13302029">And, every time that we opened a gate like that and let fraud get into our elections, then the republic an form of government that Article IV Section 4 of our Constitution guarantees, no longer will be applicable to it.</text>
