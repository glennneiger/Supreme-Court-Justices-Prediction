            <text syncTime="18.309" offset="146892">I pointed out yesterday that with a dual school system still in effect in Halifax County in 1969, 15 years after Brown, the county turned away from the recommendations of the State Department of Public Instruction and from its agreement with the Department of Justice both of which looked toward dis-establishment of that dual school system and instead through Chapter 31 of the 1969 Session Laws, there was carved out a small separate school district for Scotland Neck, while as a mathematical matter, the removal of these 695 students could have only a limited effect on the racial percentages for the county system as whole, the effect would be very substantial in the immediate vicinity of Scotland Neck and I was about to turn to the fold out math in this large sized appendix filed by the petitioners in the consolidated case at page 12B where there is some indication of what the effect of Chapter 31's implementation would be in the immediate vicinity of Scotland Neck within District 1 of the state's Interim Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.855" offset="541132">The impact particularly is on the student assignments to the Scotland Neck School and to the Brawley School.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.826" offset="581047">The two grade 1 to 12 schools that have been conducted by this county system less than one mile apart from each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.690" offset="624410">Brawley being an all Black school and Scotland Neck the traditionally White school.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.244" offset="646667">The assignment figures printed on this map were compiled by the County Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.502" offset="695672">The map was submitted by the County Board as an exhibit to a motion of theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.050" offset="721899">And if Chapter 31 had been implemented, these figures show that Brawley School would be more than 90% Black while the Scotland Neck School would be 57% White and 43% Black.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.968" offset="997543">But close to 90% of the students would be Black at Brawley and at Scotland Neck it would be 57% White and 43% Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.600" offset="1052087">By contrast, under the Interim Plan, which the State Department of Public Instruction had recommended, the assignments to Brawley would be slightly less than 70% Black and those to Scotland Neck more than 66% Black, a very similar ratio.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.341" offset="1175071">That's correct Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.999" offset="1189700">And there was also a transfer plan adapted by the Scotland Neck City Board of Education, but struck down as unconstitutional by the Court of Appeals which would have increased the disparity under Chapter 31 even more on the basis of the first application filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.927" offset="1265455">The Scotland Neck School would have gone up to 74% White.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.861" offset="1281129">The Chapter 31 has not gone into effect, because the Court of Appeals stayed its mandate pending this court's decision and the schools are now operating under a modified version of the state's Interim Plan which we have described in some detail on page 14 of our brief in footnote 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.507" offset="1387708">Now the vice of Chapter 31 as we see it, is very similar to the vice of the North Carolina Anti-Busing Law struck down by this court last term in North Carolina Board of Education against Swann.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.716" offset="1456567">Chapter 31 would substantially impair, would be an obstacle to disestablishment of the dual school system in the Scotland Neck Brawley area of this county school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.599" offset="1520097">It would fence off most of the Black students in that area from the traditionally White only Scotland Neck School and would fence off most of the Whites in that area from the nearby formerly all Black Brawley School.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.553" offset="1587911">As the District Court said, its effect would be to create a refuge from desegregation for White students of the Halifax County School System.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.742" offset="1640678">The resulting projected 90% Black enrollment at Brawley and 57% White enrollment at Scotland Neck School seems to us to bring into play the presumption against schools that are substantially disproportionate in their racial composition that this court last term said in the other Swann case applies in the context of disestablishing a dual system.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.507" offset="1767738">The Court of Appeals held that so long as this modification of the racial balance fall short of resegregation and is accomplished by means of the creation of a new school district, the court should not interfere if there are legitimate educational purposes and the primary purpose is not racial.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.005" offset="1873690">But we see nothing warranting this novel and difficult to apply test and the mere fact that the zoning here was accomplished by a new district line rather than by ordinary school assignment's zone lines.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="467.253" offset="1942758">Mr. Wallace, do you disagree with the assessment of the courts below as to the purpose for which this was done?</text>
            <text syncTime="474.168" offset="1970343">Or are you saying conceding that they are correct as to the purpose nonetheless the legal result which you urge for?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="480.383" offset="1995212">Well, we think that inquiry into primary purpose which is a very difficult one is really irrelevant to how the case should be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.258" offset="2026768">The District Court said it could not say which of the purposes it found was the primary purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.339" offset="2055085">The Court of Appeals nonetheless proceeded to apply its primary purpose standard actually announced in the companion case which is next to be argued in (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.391" offset="2103254">We don't see that the fact that new district line has been interposed rather than the ordinary method of the assigning students within the district should bring a different test into play than the test this court has applied right along in the context of school desegregation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.866" offset="2185174">Last term, for example, the court held in Davis against the School Commissioners of Mobile County that it was error for a Federal Court in remedying a dual school system to treat the eastern part of metropolitan Mobile an isolation from the rest of the school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.695" offset="2268453">If a different result would have been required, had the state interposed a new district line cutting off that eastern portion, the principle of that case and many of the court's desegregation cases would indeed be evanescent.</text>

            <text syncTime="567.554" offset="2343894">Well, Mr. Wallace if in the Mobile case those had been two separate school districts, [Voice Overlap] the result would have been quite different?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="585.391" offset="2415261">Well, that's the question whether it is really a different problem, because the state has now put a new district line and while this district was in the process of being desegregated and the process of having the school system disestablished, that's why I say the case would be the same if Alabama had put that line in the metropolitan Mobile area.</text>

            <text syncTime="806.477" offset="3299558">Essentially, the test would be whether a school assignment zone would have been properly drawn this way in the absence of splitting the district up, because the district was in the process of disestablishing a dual system and we think it plain that the burden on the state, on to the Green case has not been satisfied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.648" offset="3392240">It is relevant first of all that the new Scotland Neck school district with only 695 students is far smaller than the state's own standards concerning the desirable and minimally acceptable size for school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.294" offset="3462876">On page 12 of our brief, we have set out the evidence and record on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.006" offset="3493700">This has been made even more anomalous by the fact that both Halifax County and the town of Scotland Neck are losing population, are decreasing in size according to the 1960 and 1970 census figures; not normally the situation where you would be breaking up rather than consolidating school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.365" offset="3587114">Purposes found by the district court for Chapter 31 also fall far short in our view of an inadequate justification, more local control over the schools if desired can be achieved without selecting out so abnormally small a new district with so great a racial effect on the desegregation process in the immediate vicinity.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.943" offset="3693485">And the need for increasing school expenditures does not in our view justify fencing off the only traditionally White school and most of the White students from the other school and the surrounding area and making the improvements only in that school.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.724" offset="3776554">The only other purpose found by the District Court was prevention of anticipated White flight from the public schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="945.336" offset="3855026">That this court emphatically rejected the contention that was strongly made there that fear of White flight can justify perpetuation of some aspects of vestiges of the dual school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.905" offset="3921272">That holding, we believe was soundly based on the teaching of Brown and Cooper against Aaron that community acceptance is not to be the measure of the constitutional rights of school children.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.438" offset="3987414">And there is no reason that we can say the part of from holding here, the respondents emphasized that they have submitted post trial affidavits of school enrollment figures to show that considerable White flight has materialized in this district.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.654" offset="6288280">In the immediate area of Scotland Neck, Black children went to the Brawley school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.311" offset="6334987">In that situation the town lines of Scotland Neck had nothing whatsoever to do with pupil assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.487" offset="6367692">Therefore, you can see that the White children in the whole area, half of them, about 400 came into town, crossed the town lines, Black children in the town crossed town lines to go to the Brawley school located just across the town boundary, and indeed all the White children in the city, in the elementary grades also crossed the town lines, because the junior high school campus of the Scotland Neck school was located just outside of the town line down here about the same distance from the main campus of the Scotland Neck school as the Brawley school is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.383" offset="6547205">It was this situation which the State Department of Public Instruction in its plan sought remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.590" offset="6576045">And the remedy proposed there was a very simple neutral kind of assignment plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.747" offset="6604675">That is instead of having two high schools to serve exactly the same area; one for White and one for Black, and both of them too small under state's standards, the Scotland Neck school traditionally serving 300 White children and the Brawley school traditionally serving about 600 children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.007" offset="6685759">The state proposal consolidated those schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.782" offset="6700805">So the plan is modified such that all of the children in this area which was then designated District 1 would go to grades 10 through 12 at the Scotland Neck School, children in grades 9 would go to the Brawley school, and the elementary children would be assigned according to neutral attendance zones as shown on the map.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.743" offset="6796622">Thus there is an impact as well as the difference between what would happen at Brawley and Scotland Neck, because the elementary children who attend schools where the ratios reflect the residential patterns of the outlying areas some more of varying ratio, would under the state plan go to high school at schools where the ratios would reflect the entire area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.044" offset="6909889">However, if Chapter 31 is implemented, then they would go to the Brawley school, a school which was traditionally Black and which would have a very much more -- much Blacker ratio than the neighboring Scotland Neck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.660" offset="6976345">If we would think that if there were pressures towards Whites flight in this situation, that they would certainly be accentuated on those White children, half of the children in the area who would know that under Chapter 31 they would never be attending the traditionally White school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.410" offset="7075297">I pointed out that the boundary lines were always ignored as to pupil assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.149" offset="7106330">We've pointed out in our brief that indeed the boundary lines of the Halifax district were ignored to promote segregation, White, Black, and Indian children regularly crossing the Halifax County lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.374" offset="7179160">Now, we think that the major impact of Chapter 31 can be seen in the impact on the Brawley School and on the Scotland Neck School.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.319" offset="7227016">The White and Black school are clearly identifiable as White and Black schools after Chapter 31 is implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.931" offset="7265468">We would like to point out that a principal feature of this plan of the secession was the transfer tuition arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.495" offset="7311653">That was known by the legislature, that was publicly expressed in the newspaper, representative Gregory from the area who was a proponent who spoke of this in the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.058" offset="7361912">There was no secret about that and the plan was to collect all the White children into the Scotland Neck school and that in fact is what had happened when this case came on for preliminary injunction hearing in the summer of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.385" offset="7419277">Something like 98% of the White children in the area would always go to Scotland Neck school were again going to go to the Scotland Neck school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.875" offset="7453236">So the plan was for all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.428" offset="7463372">Without the transfer it's for half of them, but the impact we say is very substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.998" offset="7493674">Nonetheless, and it's particularly substantial in terms of the interest of my clients who live in that area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1913.801" offset="7728880">And I would point out that the unit proposed here is by far -- would be by far the smallest school administrative unit in the state of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.048" offset="7773916">When Chapter 31 was passed, it was the first new unit to be created since 1953, and since 1953, there has been a great movement of consolidation of units in the state serving state policies which hold that small units are inefficient, expensive and don't produce quality education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.425" offset="7887391">I would just ask the Court to take a look at the maps so that you can see what the plan looks like visually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.613" offset="7924172">We would suggest that it is very awkward to create the segregation we complain of, i.e., the Brawley zone looks like a donut surrounding the town of Scotland Neck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.554" offset="7979865">We had understood that awkwardness and inconvenience might be appropriate in moving towards disestablishing the dual system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.049" offset="8021870">But we would suggest that an awkward assignment arrangement is certainly inappropriate where that promotes continued segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.366" offset="8063143">In conclusion, I would say that we think as the United States has argued, that this case is controlled by the decision last term in North Carolina Board of Education against Swann, and we would urge reversal of the Court of Appeals and affirmance of the District Court's injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2026.262" offset="8178709">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.924" offset="8197413">I had intended to emphasize two basic facts that we think are very important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.841" offset="8237014">Number one, the quality of the community support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.946" offset="8265436">Number two, the proof of the unrealistic nature of the district plan and that it has failed of its purpose as shown by experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.252" offset="8326667">Then I wanted to go into the analysis of the two plans presented to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.632" offset="8368253">In view of the other arguments and in view of some questions from the bench I would like to state what I think is our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.061" offset="8413916">It's our position number one, that as between the plans, before the District Court, one I call the Scotland Neck plan and the other the District Court plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.132" offset="8470236">Even if there had been no danger of White flight, the Scotland Neck plan was superior as a desegregation measure and should have been judged by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.758" offset="8532720">If there is any doubt about that, it's our second position, that has between the two plans, the Scotland Neck plan promised realistically to work and to work now, largely because of the community support.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.584" offset="8596041">The district plan would almost (Inaudible) from the start.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.814" offset="8612969">Now, let me lay this as the foundations of our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.527" offset="8635852">As I understand that there is a great difference between desegregation and integration and that the jurisdiction of the Court to take part as almost profoundly and 180 degree turn from Brawley, which says it's constitutional to assign by race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.619" offset="8732191">We could say that it is unconstitutional not to assign by race and that the answer is that there is found a remaining vestige of the evil of law-imposed segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.931" offset="8793422">And that remaining vestige must be uprooted and that the measure adopted to destroy that remaining vestige must have a realistic opportunity to succeed and now let us see what the remaining vestige is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.625" offset="8876178">There is no evidence in this case of any defect or remaining vestige of state-imposed segregation, except two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.932" offset="8917452">In the Scotland Neck, where the resident population of -- student population of 400 White and 300 Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.378" offset="8955173">In 1968, 1969 or before that, only approximately 39 Black students had exercised their freedom of choice and about 325 White students resident outside of Scotland Neck had exercised that choice to come into Scotland Neck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.958" offset="9053498">Now, it's entirely possible and we do not contest the fact that because of that failure of freedom of choice was a mental attitude, a reluctance to enter school, dominate in which another race was highly predominant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.736" offset="9144613">And that, that mental attitude was in part, we concede a remaining vestige of state-imposed segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.189" offset="9194454">That was the thing to be attacked and that the question to be decided by the District Court was whether the Scotland Neck plan or the District plan was better designed to change that mental attitude to be a corrected measure and our basic position is that the District Court had the opportunity to accept the Scotland Neck plan or reject it and it rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.974" offset="9337605">It had the opportunity to accept it and had they accepted it, there would have been one school in the district that was truly a unitary school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.610" offset="9380133">Now the opponents have said you had a White school in Scotland Neck and a Black school in Brawley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.087" offset="9402076">We contend that that is not correct, you cannot designate 5743 as a White school and the probabilities are tremendously strong that the attendants would be approximately 50%.</text>

            <text syncTime="2358.039" offset="9505834">And we say that, that was the community support as a tremendous chance of success and if it succeeds, it can be a model or it can be proof to the public that Blacks and Whites can work together successfully and in harmony to give quality education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.296" offset="9606876">Now, good deal has been said about the Brawley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.957" offset="9621504">Scotland Neck situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.292" offset="9626833">I want to address myself to that, that seems to be the principal contention I would rather say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.458" offset="9651493">Now what was the failure, what was the wrong that was done?</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.074" offset="9689945">The wrong that was done by the state-imposed segregation was referenced to Brawley, whereas the Scotland Neck was using the Brawley school to take care of the Black resident pupils in the Scotland Neck.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_t_joyner" startTime="2420.098" stopTime="2754.014">
            <label>Mr. William T. Joyner</label>
            <text syncTime="2420.098" offset="9754102">To follow the state-imposed segregation, the school in the Scotland Neck was attended only by Whites and the Black pupils living in the Scotland Neck went to Brawley and Scotland Neck did make use of Brawley to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.707" offset="9824528">It didn't have to put up two schools within it'153, Tilton and Others against Richardson, findlaws borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.274" offset="9842813">Now if that is the wrong, then that wrong was completely cured by the statute because by the statute and after the first further filed by the Scotland Neck board, the plan of the Board announced in that answer and proclaimed by advertiser, was to take all of those 300 Black students that had been going to Brawley, most of them as a part of the remaining vestige of state-imposed segregation and assignment to Scotland Neck and to assign to Scotland Neck it's resident Whites and the transfer situation doesn't enter into the constitutionality at all because the Board announced in its answer and in its first and in its advertisement, that the transfers in and out would be according to a plan approved by the Court, but the statement were made yet that the Brawley people who were excluded from Scotland Neck, they're not excluded from Scotland Neck at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.833" offset="10125040">They have the right of freedom of choice to come into Scotland Neck in accordance with such plan as the District Court may approve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.891" offset="10173210">Now, something has been said about presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.291" offset="10190869">As I understand in the Swann case there are two types of presumptions; number 1, that there is a presumption based on disparity of racial imbalance, that there is a remaining vestige, that is a presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.656" offset="10268296">Well, that presumption has been followed here because we have accepted that and we have set forward a plan adapted by the statute to correct that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.214" offset="10322526">So that presumption has been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.158" offset="10334333">There's another presumption and that is a presumption of bad faith on the part of members of an organization, where there has been state-imposed segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.328" offset="10395042">Now we contend that, that presumption has been overcome by the unchallenged great weight of the testimony -- there's contradictory testimony, as to the good faith of the members of this community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.791" offset="10472887">Let me go on very briefly over that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.188" offset="10490441">In the testimony of Mr. Powell -- and usually it's in the index, in the appendix, a resident of Scotland Neck, a Black member of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.515" offset="10543731">He testified that he came back at New York where he had an important job or good-paying job in the Post Office Department to accept employment in Rocky Mount, and to live in the Scotland Neck, some 20-25 miles Rocky Mount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.189" offset="10622412">And significantly he said, he came back in almost all these words, because he wanted to find better schools for his children, because he could have more influence on the school in a small community and because the people of Scotland Neck were interested in improving the quality of their school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.435" offset="10723453">That's also in evidence in the deposition of Mr. Hendrik Lee Harrison taken by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.095" offset="10750098">That the people of Scotland Neck have never rebelled against desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.843" offset="10781027">They have never fought it, they've never had any incidents, they've had excellent race relations, but they've been tremendously concerned about the quality of their school and one of the concerns about the quality of the school was they threatened the White flight, flight of White students.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.861" offset="10889174">And let me emphasize that, I think, the record supports the conclusion that the fear of White flight and the occurrence of White flight was not due to a reluctance to associate with members of the earlier race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.969" offset="10961586">That fear of White flight was that it would impair the quality of the schools, and the White flight is occasioned and caused primarily of the fear of the declining quality of the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.318" offset="11046954">He testified that the people in the Scotland Neck did not think White flight was any answer to the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.129" offset="11082167">They did not think --</text>

            <text syncTime="2754.014" offset="11089795">White flight in this case would not have been a move to the suburbs or to a different area, who would have been sending children to private schools, is that it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2765.624" offset="11136188">That's right and the private schools, they think the private schools are not the answer, that private schools pose a great threat to the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.042" offset="11177880">That wherever there is massive White flight by any group of children, from the public school, the public schools must be impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.194" offset="11218422">Now, very briefly, but where some of the things, the question of transfers as I said is -- the suit against -- this suit was started in June, in August, I think it was the 16, this defendant Scotland Neck City Board of Education was made a defendant, John was a part of it for the first time and it had to appear before Judge Larkins and Judge Butler, hold the motion for preliminary injunction in four days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.246" offset="11378709">They filed a very hastened answer; they got into the court and they found that there was a very serious attack on the question of transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.679" offset="11428446">They were so anxious to establish a quality school that they did not keep it to undertake any litigation on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.673" offset="11472436">There was permission of the court, they filed an further amended action and they said plainly in that amended answer which is Exhibit A to our brief that we propose to operate a school that will embrace all of the students, Black and White, Resident in Scotland Neck and transfers in and out will be made in accordance with a plan to be approved by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.107" offset="11606079">In their quest for the answers, they requested the court to retain jurisdiction in order that it could supervise those transfers and In Judge Larkins opinion, he said that they would anticipate no trouble in having those transfers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.893" offset="11681311">The injunction would have friezed all the money that had been collected as a special tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.625" offset="11712240">The committee got the permission of the court to advertise or to solicit more contributions to defend the law suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.874" offset="11749230">The board then published an advertisement, a three page advertisement in which it gave a blueprint of its proposed operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.158" offset="11786324">It made it public, it announced to the public that it was their intention to do what the first further answer said and it was their intention to conduct a unitary school without any prejudice whatsoever between Blacks and Whites and to public and to conduct a school in which there would be not discernible lines drawn between that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.807" offset="11892903">That also is a blueprint of good faith that was published to the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.449" offset="11923519">More on the question of good faith, when the case came up for final hearing before Judge Larkins and Judge Butler, Scotland Neck examined Mr. Shields, the Chairman of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.771" offset="11988825">He testified as to the quality of the race relations in the community, he testified as to the intent of the board, he was examined by Mr. Josey (ph) about everything that was said in that advertisement which, by the way, is appendix B in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.750" offset="12072730">He testified that he and every member of the board truly met what they have said and that they continued to have those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.750" offset="12120691">He would stand over to the other side to examine and his whole examination is in Exhibit C to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.757" offset="12168756">And at the end of his examination about the intent of the Board that's on page 50 of our brief in Exhibit C.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.790" offset="12220897">Mr. Chairman said alright your witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.399" offset="12231241">Mr. Kennedy represented the Department of Justice, no questions Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.512" offset="12251721">Judge Larkins asked him one question, did you receive any response?</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.130" offset="12266245">His answer was, he received a very favorable response and there were no other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.908" offset="12289338">Mr. Josey then had sworn the other four members of the Board and he asked each of them, they had heard the testimony of Mr. Shields and they said -- they didn't answer it in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.022" offset="12345762">He said, that they had heard the testimony and agreed with what he said and agreed with the advertisement and what he said about the advertisement, would they hold up their hand?</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.118" offset="12386200">Everyone had held up the hands as shown by the record on page 15, on our brief attention, tangent to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.481" offset="12419636">Again, Mr. Josey tended them for cross examination and there was not a question asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.332" offset="12443042">They are committed to the policies set forth in that advertisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.423" offset="12463418">I also point out with reference to that, that in this case that was not introduced by the opponents, by the petitioner here, one witness to question the good faith of the Board and what it said in its first further answer or what it said in its advertisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.643" offset="12564250">As a matter of fact, there was not introduced one witness resident in Scotland Neck or the Scotland Neck area that complained of the Scotland Neck plan or expressed opposition to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.143" offset="12630288">Now, let me go back, or that was a conclusion I would draw from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.971" offset="12649618">Number one, that that un-contradicted evidence, unchallenged evidence, and there is no evidence in the case to the contrary proves completely the good faith of these men who were trying to achieve quality education in Scotland Neck and overcomes the presumption of evil referred to in this one case of a desire to perpetuate segregation or any evil desire.</text>

            <text syncTime="3233.334" offset="13007078">On that Mr. Josey answered, that's been more certain than I did, but in my opinion based on the record, there is no question what that Scotland Neck would have asked for a special district entirely irrespective of desegregation because they were not getting sufficient money to support their school, they needed more money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.351" offset="13111150">Judge Larkins says in his opinion, they had not been getting what they regarded and what the Court found supported their evidence on equal break from the county.</text>

            <text syncTime="3386.364" offset="13619179">This Court has said that the objective is to uproot all vestiges of remaining segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.948" offset="13661498">Well, that primarily has rural students, non-rural students, Scotland Neck primarily is a school for let’s say, for these children in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.272" offset="13710817">Now the use of Brawley’s, I have said was that it took care of the Scotland Neck’s students.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.076" offset="13741955">But now, Scotland Neck is not sending a one to Brawley.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.892" offset="13757315">Scotland Neck is enrolling under the Scotland Neck plan, would enroll everyone of them in its own schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.154" offset="13794304">That is the value of that plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.312" offset="13806947">And my time is nearly up, so I have to be quite brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.927" offset="13829413">The plan is a complete establishment of a unitary school in Scotland Neck and there would be no Black students sent from Scotland Neck to Brawley, enroller still have a freedom of choice to enter the Scotland Neck School, but – and the other two things I was saying, number one; that the Scotland Neck plan as being a better plan than the district plan does set up one school that can be a model and it doesn't assign a single student to it's schools outside of the community in which they live.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.185" offset="14010389">They all would come in the -- the plan would not cause the irritations and the resistance that the Brawley plan caused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.035" offset="14049886">And I have no time to go into this Mr. Josey may go into it, but it's in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.700" offset="14080502">We contend and a part of it is set forth specific in our brief that elements of advantage the Scotland Neck plan would have even if there would be no White flight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.774" offset="14132747">Now bear in mind, it's our view that if White flight is caused by the loss of confidential that people in maintaining the quality of their schools, that they fear that to get a quality education, they must go to private schools, and that's the danger that exists everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.259" offset="14246745">But as a matter of fact, whether that's true or not, the Scotland Neck plan is preferable because the Scotland Neck plan secondly would have a greater opportunity of deterring White Flight, than would the district plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="3574.412" offset="14371297">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.751" offset="14384671">I would first like to refer to the question that Mr. Justice White adverted to concerning the tax structure in the effect if the Scotland Neck Bill was found constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.444" offset="14459486">The tax is levied uniformly throughout the county on ad valorem basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.454" offset="14491565">Then each separate school unit, a manipulated unit, it assigned that portion or that county-based tax on a per pupil ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.207" offset="14546526">Now in addition, each separate school district, and I think this is true throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.878" offset="14573171">In most cases, have an additional or supplementary tax, which they themselves levy and which they themselves receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.827" offset="14621027">So therefore, separate units, separate administrative units, can and do get a supplementary tax plus, by law must get that -- per pupil basis of the county tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.157" offset="14670347">Now that's one of the problems that this school in Scotland Neck face from the very beginning from 1936 until date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.308" offset="14706918">They did not receive their per pupil ratio of a county tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="4772.768" offset="19164766">Now we have not had any demonstrations here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4775.721" offset="19176573">We have not had any board cuts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4777.851" offset="19185142">As far as I know, there has been no friction between the two races.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.317" offset="19198934">But I cannot say that about any other community in Halifax County and I personally have felt that if folks right down here that go ahead and integrate and get it over and get on back to education that is it would be effort well spent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.727" offset="19260583">I was aware of and was in agreement with Mr. Harrision when he asked for an integrated high school down here, and that was in 1966 before agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="4809.732" offset="19312619">There were others that felt, well, in this way we can go ahead, we will be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.221" offset="19330591">We can go ahead with education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4816.639" offset="19340205">So, I am sure that in our discussion, and I felt like this was, we had tried every method that I knew of to try within the county, to try to go ahead and in this end of the county, I am not talking about independently, but for us to go ahead and move on into integration, I felt like this setting up this school system would bring us in compliance with the law and we could go ahead without interrupting “education”.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.973" offset="19453576">We contend that the two judge district court, after several days observing this type of witness, and after sharply questioning them personally concluded that the Scotland Neck City System could and would be operated in a completely nondiscriminatory manner and for the betterment of the education of its students.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.987" offset="19537690">In its findings of fact, “The Halifax County School Superintendent as saying that the interim plan which the court eventually ordered, could still be implemented if the constitutionality of the Scotland Neck district was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.230" offset="19590667">That Halifax County would still get the same amount of money per pupil from the state and from local sources in the county and that the county would have an even better pupil teacher ratio in certain areas of instructions”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.746" offset="19656704">The court further added, “If the school district itself were found to be constitutional, it would not be difficult to fashion an acceptable transfer plan by either limiting transfers in and out sets that the Black-White ratio would be the same after accepting transfer or by accepting an equal number of Blacks and Whites”.</text>
