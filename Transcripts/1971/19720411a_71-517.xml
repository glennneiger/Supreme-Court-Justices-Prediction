            <label>Mr. James N. Perry</label>
            <text syncTime="43.531" offset="247808">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.440" offset="263481">We’d like to acknowledge and recognize that Mr. William F. Hopkins would have been here today, but on advice of counsel, he was unable to travel to Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.836" offset="305068">The petitioner was charged with an indictment having to do with receiving, possessing, and concealing goods that were stolen in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.493" offset="363687">When the matter came on for trial, there was a pretrial motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.415" offset="387302">The argument was basically that the affidavit in the search warrant was defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.385" offset="411230">Without the issue of standing having been challenged, the Court overruled the pretrial motion to suppress, the matter went to trial, petitioner was found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.832" offset="456997">When the matter was appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals for the first time, the United States Government raised the issue of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.040" offset="489806">The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that we did not have standing and they affirmed the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.462" offset="519481">Now, the argument of the petitioner is relatively straight forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.180" offset="546440">We feel there’s a tension between the Fourth and the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.299" offset="562845">We’re relying upon Jones and we’re relying upon Simmons, and we’re saying that if an indictment has as one of its element’s possession, the Government cannot deny to a standing to attack a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.650" offset="624285">Now the Government has argued that actually they have two positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.139" offset="642257">They’ve argued that Simmons gives the petitioner protection because whatever he says at the pretrial hearing cannot be used against him but the trial in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.047" offset="693875">And they also, have urged the Court to adopt the theory that a thief can have no expectation of privacy with regard to the goods that he stolen, and cannot therefore bring himself within the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.764" offset="776735">The police said here that he did it and they simply go the checkroom operator and say, we would like to look around here for some goods we think that were stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.855" offset="813098">The checkroom operator says, come on in.</text>

            <text syncTime="941.573" offset="3839958">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.126" offset="3858139">This case presents the single issue whether one charged with possession of stolen property should by virtue of that charged alone be accorded automatic standing to challenge a search for or seizure of that property, and in order to put that issue in proper context, let me amplify on the facts provided by Mr. Perry just briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.843" offset="3961062">Prior to trial in this case, petitioner moved to suppress the 26 cases of whiskey involved here that were seized by the Kentucky State Police, claming that the underlying affidavit for the search warrant was legally deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.036" offset="4025846">The motion was heard by the District Court and denied and at that time the question of standing was not raised or argued by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.019" offset="4069731">The case then proceeded to trial where the government’s evidence reveals the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.684" offset="4096376">On July 28, 1969, petitioner telephoned one Janet Ballard and asked whether she knew of anyone who wanted to buy some whiskey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.694" offset="4140471">She said, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.258" offset="4146740">And later that day, petitioner delivered approximately 40 cases of whiskey to her home in Newport, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.300" offset="4178923">The following evening, Mrs. Ballard called petitioner, told him that she had heard the whiskey was stolen and asked the he removed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.387" offset="4219256">He did so with the help of one James Martin, Mrs. Ballard’s brother, and they stored the whiskey in a basement of the home of petitioner’s estranged wife, which at that time also contained some 30 or 40 additional cases of whiskey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.919" offset="4285398">Later that same week, Martin received the -- a telephone call from petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.852" offset="4309117">He was told that “the heat was on” and that the whiskey had to be moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.043" offset="4333881">The two men then went to the house, loaded all the cases of whiskey onto a pick-up truck and transported the whiskey some 200 miles to Hazard, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.015" offset="4373692">The cases were stored in an old shed on the farm of petitioner’s father.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.685" offset="4400441">Thereafter, Martin went to the FBI agents assigned to the area and told him of the stolen whiskey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.912" offset="4433356">The agent gave the information to the Kentucky State Police and they obtained and executed a warrant to search the father’s farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.482" offset="4467628">Pursuant thereto, the police seized in the shed the 26 cases of whiskey involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.684" offset="4500438">Petitioner who is now present at the time was later arrested in his home in Newport, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.114" offset="4530113">His defense at trial was based on testimony given by petitioner and members of his family to the effect that the shed had earlier been rented by James Martin and one Charles Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.248" offset="4590717">That it was Martin and Chapman who had stored the whiskey in the shed and the petitioner had not been on or near his father’s farm during the relevant period and had never anything to do with the whiskey in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.032" offset="4653829">Following his conviction, petitioner appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals on the ground that the whiskey had been seized under an invalid search warrant and that the evidence had therefore been improperly admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.817" offset="4704925">The Government, recognizing for the first on appeal that the underlying affidavit for the search warrant was legally deficient under Aguilar v. Texas argued only in the Court of Appeals the petitioner lacks standing to raise the Fourth Amendment claim.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Bradford Reynolds</label>
            <text syncTime="1663.045" offset="6725862">Now, the problem that the -- the reason we have such a problem with respect to standing is because of the decision of this Court in Jones v. United States where it was held that one who is charged with a possessory crime, in this case possession of stolen property automatically has standing to contest or challenge the search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.448" offset="6823455">And we believe that the dual rational of the Jones decision has been undermined significantly by the subsequent decision in this Court in Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.187" offset="6870476">And that it should be reexamined by this Court and to the extent that it would confer automatic standing in one charged with a possessory crime of stolen property it should be abandoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.188" offset="6926378">The reason given, one of the reasons given by the Court to sustain the automatic standing rule, it’s -- was essentially that the defendant in order to establish standing to suppress evidence might well have virtually to admit his guilt of the possessory offense charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.104" offset="7038077">And his virtual admission could then at that time, be used against him at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.910" offset="7061274">In this prospect or dilemma as it were referred to in Jones was viewed by the Court as a deterrent on some defendants who would otherwise have come forward to vindicate their Fourth Amendment claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.587" offset="7112056">And was thus considered, the Court said to weaken the efficacy of the exclusionary rule as a sanction from unlawful police behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.613" offset="7152180">No longer, however does there seem to be a real prospect of later direct use at trial of testimony given earlier in support of a suppression motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.931" offset="7193349">In Simmons v. United States at 390 U.S. decided several years after Jones, this Court held the testimony given by a defendant in support of his motion to suppress under the Fourth Amendment may not thereafter be admitted against him at trial on the issue of guilt unless he makes no objection and this use restriction rule of Simmons essentially removes the dilemma that was confronting defendants at the time that Jones was deciding and then thereby eliminates one of the two reasons given by the Court in Jones for fashioning an automatic standing rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.578" offset="7356040">As to the other reason which was that the Government would have the benefit of the -- the rule of the automatic standing rule was fashioned so the Government would not have the benefit of contradictory positions as a basis for conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.366" offset="7423122">That’s also undermined by Simmons cause that rational was based on the argument that if a defendant was sufficiently deterred from asserting his Fourth Amendment right, so that he remain silent, choosing not to acknowledge any interest in the premises search to the property seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.065" offset="7505983">But the Government would then have the advantage of a position on a question of the admissibility of evidence that was seemingly inconsistent with its proof of lawful possession at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.018" offset="7565751">However, now that the fact that it was deterred, defendants from moving to suppress has been removed by Simmons, the used restriction rule of Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.095" offset="7610055">It seems unlikely that defendants will choose to forego pressing their Fourth Amendment claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.276" offset="7638789">Perhaps even more to the point, if one is charged -- who is charged with possession moves to suppress on grounds of illegal search or seizure, we do not believe that the Government is required as we understand the fundamental inquiry for purposes of standing under the Fourth Amendment to maintain a position inconsistent with or contradictory to its position at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.255" offset="7750698">In this case, petitioner’s conviction flows from proof of his knowing possession of the stolen whiskey before and at the time of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.742" offset="7796673">If the admissibility into evidence of the fruits of that search, on the ground the petitioner lacks standing is perfectly consistent we think, but the theory that petitioner have constructed possession of the whiskey at all relevant times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.924" offset="7865323">His standing depends upon some showing of an intrusion of privacy of his own person, his own house, his own papers or his own effects, or an intrusion on premises in which he personally had a legitimate expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.657" offset="7940347">In the absence of such a showing, the evidence is admissible without regard to whether petitioner might claim which he never has done in this case that he possessed the stolen whiskey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.281" offset="7998757">It would thus be no need for the Government to dispute such a claim on a motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.896" offset="8029268">In sum, we do not believe that he had the fundamental purpose of the Fourth Amendment to protect individual privacy, or the dual rational of Jones v. United States when read in light of this Court’s subsequent decision in Simmons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.921" offset="8089349">Warrants and application of auto -- of the automatic standing rule to one charge with lawless possession on the sole basis for its Fourth Amendment claim is the seizure of stolen property in which he has no legitimate proprietary interest and with respect to which he can have no reasonable expectation of privacy.</text>
