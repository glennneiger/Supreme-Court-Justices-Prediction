            <label>Mr. Charles Stephen Ralston</label>
            <text syncTime="35.330" offset="215003">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.913" offset="237364">I represent the petitioner, Claude (ph) Alexander in this case which is here on the petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Louisiana to review the affirmance of petitioner’s conviction of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.931" offset="297446">The petitioner is a black male who was convicted in Lafayette Parish in Louisiana and he raised in the State Courts and raises here three constitutional challenges to his indictment and his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.903" offset="369335">First, he urges that members of his race were unconstitutionally excluded from the jury list and the venire from which the grand jury that indicted him was selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.674" offset="432342">Secondly, he urges that the total exclusion of women from the service from jury list, and therefore, from service on juries in the parish also denied him due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.151" offset="506321">And finally, he urges that the use at his trial of a statement which was taken without compliance the requirements of Miranda versus Arizona denied him Due Process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.446" offset="567447">With regard to the first contention, the exclusion of blacks from jury, we urge basically that petitioner clearly established a prima facie case of jury discrimination within the rule of the series of cases beginning with Avery versus Georgia and proceeding to Whitus versus Georgia and the cases that followed Whitus and I will return to briefly discuss why we urge that there is a clear prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.150" offset="706314">Therefore, the issue really in this case is whether the state has offered a satisfactory rebuttal to that prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.503" offset="751663">In other words, has the state given a constitutionally satisfactory explanation to a situation where a disproportion of black representation on juries has been shown wherein the jury selection process racial designations were before the jury commissioners when they selected the persons who were to be on the jury list?</text>
            <text syncTime="199.998" offset="873707">In getting to why a clear prima facie case has been made out, briefly, the evidence introduced in the motion to quash the indictment in the Court below showed that there is a significant draw up in the proportion of blacks on the rolls or on the group of persons who were being considered for jury service during stages in the jury selection process when the commissioners were working from documents on which there appeared racial designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.316" offset="1034935">The jury commission was operating under Louisiana Statute which required that jury venires from at least 300 persons be made up.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.283" offset="1078820">In this particular instance in Lafayette Parish, they went above the minimum and established venires of 400 persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.574" offset="1119989">The Louisiana Statute did not set out the procedure by which these 400 persons are to be arrived at.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.143" offset="1158233">They do set out qualifications for jurors and certain exemptions, which are mostly exemptions based on occupation and physical disability.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.093" offset="1210060">Jury commissioners worked from a number of sources of names as a starting point to achieve the final 400.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.674" offset="1252378">The main source was voter registration list, a city directory which covered the City of Lafayette itself, telephone directory and certain other lists which are not fully specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.296" offset="1318833">Initially there was an objection raised because these lists or at least certain of them, the voter registration list and the telephone directory were not admittedly fully representative of the black community.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.967" offset="1377557">That is there is a disproportion of black representations compared to the black -- to the white disproportion and we urge that this is one basis why the jury selection method violated the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.039" offset="1433877">However, when these lists were used, the jury commissioners mailed out to prospective jurors, a total of 11,000 questionnaires and received back approximately 7,300.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.920" offset="1513393">Now, of those 7,300, 13.67% were from blacks, and this is in a population -- this is black males over 21, that is, this is in a population where black males over 21 represented 20.27% of the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.524" offset="1591761">On the questionnaires there was a request for the race of the person returning the questionnaire and this was filled in all, but 189 of the questionnaires.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.799" offset="1636900">A card was made up, which also had a racial designation.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.065" offset="1653932">These 7,000 questionnaires were then gone through -- through process of -- the commissioners say weeding out those who were not qualified or who might claim exemptions from the service until approximately 2,000 questionnaires were arrived at.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.585" offset="1731986">There is no evidence in this record as to the racial composition of that 2,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.454" offset="1759467">However, the 2,000 were then put on a table and from those 2,000 were selected 400, a white set of paper having just the name and address of the person, each of the 400 persons was put into a box from which 20-man grand jury venires would be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.448" offset="1855493">In the particular instance of petitioner of those 20, one was black and he was not picked when the final 12-man venire was picked or selected from the 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.441" offset="1927486">Now, of those 400 names at the end of the selection process, the portion of blacks was down to approximately 6.75% and it is this –- this proportion together with the fact that at the time in the process when an overall population of more than 13% was being examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.051" offset="2045873">There were racial designations on the documents used.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.631" offset="2060189">There was a clear opportunity to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.316" offset="2070951">It was condemned by Whitus and Avery, coupled with a disproportionate weeding out of blacks as opposed to whites and it is --</text>

            <text syncTime="543.695" offset="2248479">The thing that is not clear is that when they had weeded out the 7,000 down to the 2,000 questionnaires from which the ultimate 400 were selected, what was the racial proportions of the 2,000 and we pointed out that whichever way, whatever -- whichever happened, whether the 13% were reduced down to 6% when the weeding out process occurred or whether it went from 13% to 6% when the final 400 were drawn, either way a prima facie case has been made out because in both times there were racial designations available to the commissioners to use during this -- during the process.</text>

            <text syncTime="613.240" offset="2526631">Would draw inferences from that stage, from 20% down to 13.7?</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_stephen_ralston" startTime="619.614" stopTime="918.108">
            <label>Mr. Charles Stephen Ralston</label>
            <text syncTime="619.614" offset="2552126">I think under the circumstances of this case that a serious constitutional question arises just from that shrinkage because the jury commissioners admitted that the sources, at least two of the sources, the voter registration rules and the telephone book underrepresented the black population.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.289" offset="2618791">So that they knew they were getting a greater response from whites and the Court has indicated that for sometime that where -- that there is a duty on the jury commissioners not to use methods that they know are going to result in a underrepresentation so that there is not a reasonable cross-section of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.251" offset="2714713">We do not rely on that solely, but we do urge the entire process has to be looked at because the ultimate end of this process was a drop from 20% down to 6.75%.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.278" offset="2770824">Now, we again feel that the use of these questionnaires with racial designations on the drop of proportion brings this case directly under Avery and Whitus and the issue is essentially whether the state has sufficiently rebutted this prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.204" offset="2866536">In words of Whitus, has the state offered any testimony that the percentage of Negroes on the tax digest were not fully qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.661" offset="2904362">Here we are dealing with the percentage of blacks responding to the questionnaires.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.492" offset="2927663">Has a state given any objective evidence that the proportion of blacks qualified, who responded to these questionnaires was not as fully qualified as the whites who responded to the questionnaires and essentially again we say they have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.471" offset="3019614">They testified of course that they do not take race into consideration in making their selections, but this Court has held in numerous instances that such protestations are not sufficient to rebut a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.944" offset="3085442">They say that they apply these various objective criteria that are on the face of the questionnaire.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.363" offset="3131104">This, however, conflicts with the presence of the racial designation on the questionnaire in this respect that if all that was going on was what was on the questionnaire in terms of occupation, etcetera, it is not at all clear why, what function, the racial identification plays except to bring into play personal knowledge or subjective opinions of the commissioners about a particular individual which is information not reflected on the questionnaire.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.029" offset="3281779">The simple fact is that the jury commission had within its power in this case to come forward and explain or to justify this drop in proportion of blacks by showing, by either, number one, keeping a record of the reasons why people were disqualified or coming forward with questionnaires which were available to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.616" offset="3372162">It just simply did not do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.399" offset="3379268">In any way, simply rested on assertions about how it functioned and again in the face of the racial designations and the opportunity to discriminate, we contend this simply was not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.589" offset="3448022">I just make one additional comment about one of the questions on the questionnaire which possibly might have been used to justify the inclusion of blacks and that is the questions of whether a person could read or write or what their educational attainments were.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.618" offset="3528166">In Turner versus Fouche, this Court specifically reserved in footnote 22, the issue of whether such a standard could be used by a state with a history of racial discrimination in its schools to justify a higher rate of exclusion of blacks from jury service.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.065" offset="3609981">I will point this out not that this issue should be decided in this case that that if the state were made to come forward with an explanation of the disproportion and they offer this as a possible explanation, this would raise an entirely another issue arising under the Fourteenth Amendment with regard to whether this kind of a standard was proper and it had this kind of a result.</text>
