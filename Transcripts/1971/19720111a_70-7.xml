            <label>Mr. Frank G. Whalen</label>
            <text syncTime="31.946" offset="201413">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.974" offset="233595">Two questions are presented here for the Court’s consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.890" offset="257210">First question is considering the implication of the questions, the circumstances, and setting under which they were asked, where the petitioner is justified in pleading the Fifth Amendment under a State Immunity Statute according to the -- to afford transactional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.450" offset="347489">And the second question, must the State affirmatively demonstrate to respondents when testifying and pursuant to the Illinois Immunity Act, that an immunity is brought in scope as the Fifth Amendment privilege is available and applicable to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.305" offset="434843">In 1963, the Illinois legislature created the Illinois Crime Investigating Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.549" offset="471832">The sole purpose of which was to investigate organized crime in the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.359" offset="499104">In 1968, petitioners, Sarno and McCarty, where ordered to appear and give testimony before this Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.159" offset="538288">They appeared and refused to testify, pleading the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.239" offset="562634">Now, as to the circumstances and the studying that were found at the time they appeared, the first would be that Illinois at this time had a double standard of Immunity Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.489" offset="619581">There was the Grand Jury Act, which applied to proceedings before Grand Juries and to -- and before Trial Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.094" offset="666079">Under this the Grand Jury Act, a witness was given immunity from prosecution for any offense shown in whole or in part by such testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.650" offset="724279">Further, this Act, the Grand Jury Act had been interpreted by the Illinois State Supreme Court in People versus Walker, 28 Illinois 2nd 585 and there the Supreme Court in very strong language upheld the constitutionality of that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.058" offset="797945">In fact, the Court there said that the statue eliminates the constitutional privilege against self incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.982" offset="833576">Now, the State of Illinois Immunity Act which we are concerned here with, provided a witness shall not be prosecuted or an account of any transaction, matter or thing concerning which he gave answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.824" offset="916959">The Act further contained this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.146" offset="934304">The Court shall not order any such person to testify or produce evidence if it reasonably appeared to the Court that such testimony or evidence would subject such witness to an indictment, information or prosecution under the laws of another State or of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.041" offset="1025837">This statute had never been interpreted by the State Supreme Court and was first interpreted on this offensive appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.997" offset="1065648">This was a public hearing without the privacy in terms of Grand Jury proceeding, and it became obvious to the petitioners that the questions asked were based upon records that had been at a prior time, illegally seized from the home of the petitioner McCarty.</text>

            <text syncTime="420.155" offset="1754340">These records had been ordered suppressed in the Trial Court and returned to the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.129" offset="1782239">However, they latter at this time found -- brought it to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.712" offset="1800524">Further, at this time, Illinois had six statutes of carried immunity provisions and contained the phrase “or subjected to penalty or forfeiture.”</text>
            <text syncTime="446.199" offset="1858516">State of Illinois at this time had a malice is the just of the action statute, providing six months imprisonment in the County Jail and had at this time enacted a law making criminal usury a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.705" offset="1932495">Further as to the sudden circumstances, the State of Illinois at this had more provision for discovery in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.269" offset="1990800">In the same and under these to circumstances then, the petitioners where examine concerning more than 200 transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.776" offset="2036776">And, it was apparent that in the event of future prosecutions it would be impossible to ascertain whether or not the prosecution was based upon evidence independently obtained or upon the fruit or the links of the compelled testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.558" offset="2115875">The questions that were oppose to the petitioner’s fell into five separate categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.721" offset="2136564">They have been abstracted in our brief and I would refer to one that question at abstract 42, question 12 and ask, suppose in the petitioners had been asked only this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.229" offset="2198630">The question, at what places in Cook County have your dues customers met you to make their weekly payments and petitioners gave answers to the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.018" offset="2261742">Assume then that the State went to these places interviewed all those found there and learned from them that petitioners had committed anyone of the offenses, punishable under the criminal code.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.312" offset="2326944">Whether committed against the particular persons that they interviewed or against some persons known to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.861" offset="2357142">Well, petitioners then would be in a position where they have no asked, they had not been asked to give answer to any act of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.275" offset="2398728">Nevertheless, the answer to the question would be the link, necessarily to prosecute them for offense of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.449" offset="2443450">They further believed that the Illinois State Legislature when creating this commission did not intent to afford or did not intent for it to afford an immunity as broad in scope as the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.390" offset="2523280">The Courts two years after the opinion of the Illinois Supreme Court in People versus Walker in which they upheld the constitutionality of the Grand Jury Act, this Immunity Act was amended, but the pertinent language to which I have referred remain untouched, which indicates to me certainly and to the petitioners that the legislature under this act, the Immunity Act did not intend.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.051" offset="2657863">Certainly, they did not afford an immunity as broad, but petitioners believed that was not even intended.</text>
