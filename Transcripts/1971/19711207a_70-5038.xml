            <text syncTime="28.339" offset="186995">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.504" offset="199743">The grant of certiorari in the instant case is limited to the single question whether Coleman versus Alabama is retroactive and applicable to the instant case were prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.352" offset="243106">The defendant objected to the failure to provide counsel at a preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.597" offset="264108">It is our position that the State does not have standing or right, to argue reliance or non-retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.053" offset="297859">In a case where the error was pointed out to the State by the defendant prior to the trial to the Court and the State ignored the plea proceeding to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.150" offset="338296">The case of Linkletter versus Walker established the criteria for determining whether a rule should be or should not be retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.899" offset="377271">The reasons and the criteria were the purposes to be served by the new rule, the reliance on the old rule and the effect of the new rule -- the retroactivity, retroactive application of the new rule on the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.272" offset="434740">The purpose of the rule in Coleman as I see it is to enhance the integrity of the fact finding process and thy doing this by providing a lawyer at the preliminary hearing which in Illinois is a very critical stage of the proceeding and a very vital stage of the proceeding in the prosecution of a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.035" offset="509868">The value of counsel at a preliminary hearing in Illinois is immeasurable.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.927" offset="529408">The Attorney as pointed out in Coleman can use the impeachment tool later at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.696" offset="556471">He can fashion his tool and this would be something -- would be impossible to do without an attorney at the preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.734" offset="588654">As Justice Schauer pointed out in his dissent in Bonner, Bonner is one of the cases in Illinois that established the preliminary hearing not to be a critical stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.523" offset="627733">In that case where there was no counsel the witness testified against the defendant in response to leading questions by the prosecutor in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.554" offset="667857">He was not advising my co-witnesses on his own behalf, he did not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.409" offset="687292">He was not advised that witnesses could be excluded or kept separate during examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.557" offset="707877">He was not advised at the preliminary hearing and Illinois can be used to perpetuate testimony which is specific in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.935" offset="737447">I differ with the respondent’s analogy of Stovall versus Denno and Coleman as I can contemplate a fair wind up without an attorney present but how might a preliminary hearing be there without an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.752" offset="800664">This is an adversary proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.828" offset="809023">In this particular case, in the instant case not one question was asked by the defendant, not one witness was called by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.179" offset="842355">The insufficiencies or whatever insufficiencies that there might have been indicate for the State would have been -- were corrected by leading questions by the States attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.687" offset="888435">And I would submit that unlike Stovall where you can have a fair lineup without an attorney present, it is not possible to have a fair preliminary hearing or preliminary hearing which performs the function of a preliminary hearing in Illinois without an attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.769" offset="1716726">It is an extremely rare situation only in -- perhaps certain financial claims or other claims of that type in Illinois have we seen indictments gained before the arrest sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.921" offset="1793317">In Illinois also with reference to discovery and the witnesses can be -- the lawyer can get discovery from those witnesses at the preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.617" offset="1840128">Now, under the rules as they were fashioned in Illinois at that time, the only items that the attorney were entitled to were the witnesses of -- the statements of the defendant and a list of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.905" offset="1885268">At the time of the trial and after testimony, the statements of the various witnesses were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.247" offset="1914629">Now, if these witnesses testified at trial, of course again in addition to having those statements available for impeachment or possible impeachment later on, these statements would also be available for purposes of discovery and these would be statements under the discovery rules at that time which would not be available at the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.065" offset="1989966">Under the new rules these statements are available at the time or after the bringing of the indictment but even then under the new rules of the indictment in Illinois generally do not come till three or four months after the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.247" offset="2050675">The attorney in Illinois in addition to the processes of getting discovery and providing impeachment tool can expose weaknesses in the case which might eliminate an indictment and this is very relevant certainly under the new rules in Illinois because it is my contention that the Illinois rules provide that once there has been a finding of no probable cause that the only way that this can be brought again before the Court system is for new evidence to be found and if brought again before the preliminary hearing judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.473" offset="2183586">The value of an attorney in Illinois is -- goes to other aspects of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.032" offset="2205842">The Great majority of the cases brought in Illinois are disposed off a preliminary hearing to reduction of charges, though acceptance of a plea to a lesser charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.311" offset="2246907">Through an acceptance of plea on an information which is filed right in the preliminary hearing courtroom and therefore I do not think the respondent can contest the fact that the vast majority in cases -- of cases in the State of Illinois that are brought as felony complaint are disposed off at the preliminary hearing level and this is another value at least in the State if Illinois for the retroactive or the application certainly of Coleman and the retroactive application in this case because a lawyer -- a lawyer’s presence at that preliminary hearing becomes immeasurable at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="641.910" offset="2641356">The pleas usually received at the preliminary hearing are generally quite a bit less in the event that you do partake in those discussion and those that might be taken after indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1312.828" offset="5324967">In this particular case though this does not reflect that, it reflects only of the effect on the Courts and I think that is properly dealt with the last point, the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.418" offset="5363315">Lastly, relative to the reliance point, I would like to point out that the Coleman opinion as pointed out by many of the opinion in the decision was certainly foreshadowed by the decisions that proceeded it and perhaps not relied on by some of the State Courts, it should have been because of the different opinions by the Court relative to the right of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.526" offset="5447743">The third criteria that I would like to point -- that the link rather points out is the effect of the new rule on the retroactivity of the new rule on the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.649" offset="5484314">The effect of this case, we feel is negligible because we are asking that rule to be applied and limited to only those cases where it is raised the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.899" offset="5517228">That is if a man has counsel at trial and if the counsel does not raise or make issue of the fact that he did not have an attorney at the preliminary hearing, we are asking that the Court deemed this to be waived and not apply it retroactively as to those cases where it has been raised as it has been raised in this case, we would ask that it be quite applied retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.781" offset="5608761">I think the effect on the administration of justice as to that type of application certainly would be negligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.857" offset="5641153">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. James E. Gildea</label>
            <text syncTime="1399.712" offset="5672500">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.797" offset="5688905">Must I forget to mention this I would like to first deviate from my prepared text in connection with the questions concerning the Bonner case and Justice Schauer's dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.719" offset="5740523">I would urge Your Honors to consider the fact that Justice Schauer dissent at that case did not address itself to the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.021" offset="5777721">It addressed itself to a matter of statutory interpretation as construed by the majority of the Court’s statutory interpretation under the Illinois law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.027" offset="5813770">We had a statute that provided that counsel was to be appointed at the preliminary hearing if a defendant was indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.057" offset="5861940">We had another statute saying that at the point of arraignment no plea was to be taken without appointment of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.710" offset="5900497">The Bonner case construed the two statutes to be imparting a curia and held that the two provisions required only that counsel be appointed prior to any plea wherever interposed and Justice Schauer took umbrage with that and took exception and it was his opinion that the Illinois statute provided otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.140" offset="5986283">However, he did not dissent on the basis of any constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.980" offset="6021601">As to the factual background of this case is Your Honor, this case charged the defendant with the sale of narcotics and it was a what we call a controlled sale and that an informant was used in connection with two police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.174" offset="6094326">The defendant was arrested immediately after the alleged incident and he appeared in Court the following day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.619" offset="6136121">The case was then held on call for one day and continued variously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.208" offset="6162557">Subsequently there was a preliminary hearing and we conceive that the counsel was not appointed by the judge at the preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.001" offset="6197666">There was testimony introduced at that point from one witness, one of the officers upon the testimony of that officer the judge found probable cause and held the defendant to answer to the grand jury, indictment was returned and it was not until the day that the case was set for trial that counsel for the defendant filed his motion in connection with a claim for having his constitutional rights violative by a failure to appoint counsel at the preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.145" offset="6346250">And in that connection, the motion that was filed was a motion to quash the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.511" offset="6375717">It was not a motion asking for a preliminary hearing and the defendant did not in his motion alleged that he was in fact indigent and therefore required the appointment of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.567" offset="6431932">And furthermore the defendant did not allege that he suffered any prejudice during the course of their preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.101" offset="6462130">Now, addressing myself to the principal issues here, since Linkletter versus Walker on -- down through the recent cases that the Court pronounced last year in speaking in terms of Williams and Hill and Elkanich.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.405" offset="6543318">The Court has applied a three fold test in determining whether or not a new constitutional doctrine should be held retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.350" offset="6583024">In that connection the Court has stated that deciding that issue the Court will look first of all to the purpose of the new constitutional doctrine, secondly, to prior reliance on previous standards and thirdly, to the effect on the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.913" offset="6661287">Addressing myself, first of all to the purpose of the constitutional doctrine as pronounced in Coleman versus Alabama, the Court stated that the purpose was to secure for a defendant advantages prefatory to trial and in that connection the Court mentioned six possible advantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.869" offset="6777166">The Court said that the presence of counsel at a preliminary hearing might be effective in preventing a possible bind over to the grand jury by making effective arguments and cross-examination or whatnot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.134" offset="6834218">Secondly, he could perhaps to secure a lower bail or bail initially and he would have some bearing or he would have some influence on that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.928" offset="6885418">Thirdly, by cross-examination, he could perhaps create material for impeachment at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.957" offset="6925542">He could discover the -- some of the State’s evidence that would be used to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.594" offset="6948007">He could perpetuate favorable testimony for a later date and then he could secure an early psychiatric examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.204" offset="7002446">Now, with connection to the purpose -- aspect of the purpose criterion, the Court said that where the major purpose of a new constitutional doctrine is to overcome an aspect of the trial would substantially impair the truth finding process so as to create serious doubt as to the reliability of a guilty verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.043" offset="7105891">In prior cases this Court will hold the doctrine retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.213" offset="7126580">In that connection we submit that the purposes espoused in Coleman for the appointment of counsel at a preliminary hearing do not go to that degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.733" offset="7168585">We do not believe that the functions to be served by counsel at a preliminary hearing have any substantial effect on the truth finding process at a subsequent trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.600" offset="7224069">And we do so for the following -- we make that assumption for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.592" offset="7244027">Addressing ourselves point by point to the intended effects to be served by the presence of counsel at a preliminary hearing, we have first the prospect that the presence of counsel could prevent a bind over to the grand jury by cross-examination and by argument and he could secure perhaps a lower bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.250" offset="7358652">Bearing in mind that the function of a preliminary hearing is only to establish probable cause, we submit that those two considerations would have no bearing on the subsequent trial would have nothing, no impact on the truth finding process at a trial and in fact would be mooted by subsequent guilty verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.486" offset="7459589">Since the standard proof at a trial is beyond a reasonable doubt and standard of proof at a preliminary hearing is merely a probable cause, we submit that in effect a jury finding would overcome any impediment in these two aspects that would be suffered by the defendant by failure to have the appointment of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.055" offset="7569930">As to the possibility of securing an early psychiatric examination and perpetuating favorable testimony, we submit first of all that these two considerations would occur very rarely in the normal criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.552" offset="7663867">As to the perpetuation of favorable testimony there is also this consideration that is this, whether or not defense counsel would in fact want to do so bearing in mind that by perpetuating favorable defense testimony he would have to in effect declare his defense prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.472" offset="7767521">Now first of all, preliminary hearing generally takes place and it is designed to take place shortly after arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.806" offset="7796882">At that point, the defense counsel has had a little opportunity to investigate into the allegations of the State's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.000" offset="7837633">So, generally he has insufficient knowledge to frame a defense bearing in mind that he would want to frame his defense only after he has heard the State's case or has ascertained the states case to determine whether or not he in fact would want to declare and interpose a defense and bind himself at a subsequent trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1970.626" offset="7956229">I am but I am only arguing in the sense that I am addressing myself to whether or not the failure to have counsel at a preliminary hearing will create any substantial incurment of the truth finding process at trial and that is why I address myself in that way and perhaps I did not understand the Court’s question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2002.655" offset="8084334">And in answering, attempting to answer that question, I proceed on the basis of whether or not the denial of counsel at the preliminary hearing would have any substantial effect and in result substantial effect on the truth finding process of trial and addressing myself to the functions of counsel or the purposes or the advantages to be secured by counsel at a preliminary hearing that is espoused by Court in Coleman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.744" offset="8200631">Addressing myself to those specific remarks, I feel that in that connection by not having counsel for that purpose the defendant would not suffer any substantial incurment as the truth findings functions at trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2416.977" offset="9741542">I might also say that the preliminary hearing in Illinois is not particularly suited for the utilization or the gaining of the benefits that were intended on the Coleman rule, for example, that in the State of Illinois there is no requirement that a preliminary hearing be attended by a court reporter or a transcript be made of the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.031" offset="9841852">The Court is only required to hear so much evidence as will give rise to conclusion in his mind that there is probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.611" offset="9876125">That is that the defendant -- that a crime was committed and that this particular defendants before the bench committed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.627" offset="9900157">The presumption is therefore that the judge could hear just testimony from one witness and would not necessarily have to hear defense testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.937" offset="9953447">Furthermore, the testimony at a preliminary hearing maybe based upon hearsay evidence solely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.370" offset="9979152">And generally the rule is, or the practice is, the same as with grand jury matters and that is that the State will only call one witness, generally a police officer and he will relate what facts were revealed by the process of his investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.128" offset="10062221">So, in reality there is not that great of an opportunity to secure material for impeachment and to discover that much about the State’s case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.395" offset="10167233">As to the second criterion used by the -- or used by the Court as practiced in determining whether or not a case should be held retroactive that being the question of reliability, we submit that the State of Illinois did in good faith rely upon prior standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.580" offset="10251975">The only cases that were before the Court concerning the question of appointment of counsel were of course Powell versus Alabama which concerned itself with the effect that -- counsel at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.635" offset="10308190">I do not believe that bears on the Coleman question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.636" offset="10328252">Other than that we had Hamilton versus Alabama and White versus Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.091" offset="10350090">Hamilton versus Alabama was a question of concerning the appointments of counsel in an arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.126" offset="10378198">Now, in Illinois counsel is required to reappoint arraignment and under Hamilton, of course the arraignment there differed, we believe drastically from the preliminary hearing in Illinois in this respect in Hamilton versus Alabama of course, the defendant had to assert rights there such as a plea and abatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.870" offset="10477150">A challenge to the composition of the grand jury and (Inaudible), I assume too or by not doing so he would forever waive those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.219" offset="10514557">Now, under Illinois law as interpreted in People versus Bonner, there was no binding effect that a defendant could suffer by not having or by not asserting any rights or by not objecting to any evidence at the preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.264" offset="10586760">Indeed if he testified, that testimony could not be used against him during a subsequent proceeding and he was not bound by a failure to assert any defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.607" offset="10652066">And of course in White versus Maryland the – there, there was a plea of guilty interposed by the defendant at the preliminary hearing which was used at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.423" offset="10695325">And that ipso facto did bear upon the truth finding process at the trial since it was considered by the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.162" offset="10738375">Now Illinois as relied on this distinction has pointed out the distinction in People versus Bonner, in that connection I would call the Court’s attention to the fact that we were not alone in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.478" offset="10779544">There were some 33 other jurisdictions that also pointed to that fact in distinguishing their preliminary hearings from those in White versus Maryland and as against the arraignment proceedings in Hamilton versus Alabama and as to amongst those 33 other jurisdictions, all of the Federal Courts of Appeals subsequent to 1963 did themselves hold that where the preliminary hearing was not such as to bind -- defend at the trial that the requirement of counsel was not of constitutional dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.282" offset="10950802">So, we submit there was no clear foreshadowing of the Coleman Doctrine prior to the announcement of Coleman that the Illinois Courts could be bound by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.407" offset="11019348">As to the effect upon the administration of justice, the appellant asserts that it is his contention that this would not affect a great number of cases in Illinois because of the fact or a great number of cases anywhere because of the fact that it is his contention that the failure to interpose an objection on that basis must be considered a waiver and we consider that -- we believe that that is a misinterpretation of the law as stated by this Court in O’Conner versus Ohio where it said that a defendant could not be deemed to waive an objection to a constitutional question that was subsequently pronounced because it could be no more binding on him that it could be upon the States who could not have anticipated such a ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.688" offset="11208474">So I do not believe that he is correct in his say as to that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2856.223" offset="11498538">So that we submit that there is a vast number of cases prior to 1964 and 1965 that would have to perforce be affected by any ruling by this Court holding the requirement of counsel at a preliminary hearing retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.003" offset="11593728">Furthermore, since in Illinois and I believe in many other States a transcripts of the preliminary hearing is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.599" offset="11628105">It becomes a very difficult question to determine how if Chapman, if the case is to be remanded on the bases of Chapman versus California for a determination of whether or not there was harmless error, how could that be established where there was no transcript of the preliminary hearing in which anybody can decide what in fact happened at the preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.090" offset="11726012">Furthermore, what criteria would be used by the Court to decide whether or not failure to cross-examine, failure to object would have any substantial effects on the truth finding process of the trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.169" offset="11794348">How could that determination be made?</text>

            <text syncTime="2935.674" offset="11816396">The problem of finding change, there would be no standards, no guidelines that the Court could use and as to cases going far back, I question whether or not it could even be ascertained at least from the State's point of view, whether or not the petitioner did have the benefits of counsel or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3042.005" offset="12241669">Justice Schauer in his dissent in Bonner did deal with constitutional issues and as a matter of fact stated that if constitutional issues are to be considered, this is the last two paragraphs of his opinion, the appropriate constitutional reference in my opinion is Escobedo versus Illinois in which it was held that a constitutional right of counsel was abrogated when a suspect was denied an opportunity to consult with his retained attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.174" offset="12334352">Following that he points out to the -- he points out the different advantages a defendant would have where he would have had an attorney at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.256" offset="12370714">So, Justice Schauer did in his concurring opinion or in his dissenting opinion in Bonner did speak to the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.127" offset="12398195">Further, I would like to point this out that relative to the motion to dismiss the indictment that was filed, the motion to dismiss indictment within Illinois had the same effect as the motion to request a preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.523" offset="12447723">The indictment would have been dismissed, the statute of limitations would have been tolled, there would have been no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.048" offset="12469875">Thirdly, I would like to say this, whether in fact a harmless error could be shown would depend I think on the individual case, and therefore, it would become relevant whether a case was a strong or weak one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.259" offset="12522747">In this case the testimony revolved around the uncorroborated statement or substantially uncorroborated statement of an addict informer who allegedly purchased narcotic during a substantial period of time, though the policemen were not present and a lot of things could have happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="3133.349" offset="12607070">In Illinois and on the basis of the different appellate opinions, a sale of narcotics to an addict informer which is substantially uncorroborated would merit reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.254" offset="12658688">The Courts in the -- the Court has in cases dealing with the right to counsel as a judicial proceeding have held this to be retroactive in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.491" offset="12703619">We are contending and asking in the present case that this be done here too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.544" offset="12719815">One more thing I would like to point out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.143" offset="12734234">The due process exception in Bonner or alleged due process, there is nothing in Bonner which specifically states that a man has a remedy if he could show prejudice and I think one of the difference and perhaps if this Court and their opinion would point out the difference, one of the differences between Coleman or Stovall and Johnson and Coleman is in Stovall, we specifically state that there is a due process or a stopgap in the event because it is not being held retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.162" offset="12866309">In Johnson, they specifically say that the due process is stopgap relative to the issue of voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.121" offset="12890133">The Bonner case in Illinois does not set out any test whatsoever as to whether or not something should devolve or be a violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.252" offset="12938721">The only remarks in either Bonner or Morris is that in this case no prejudice was shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.067" offset="12961917">It does not state specifically that if prejudice would be shown that we would -- that there would be any opportunity for the defendant to waive this in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.487" offset="12999638">So I think this is another important difference between Stovall, between Johnson and between Coleman in that in Stovall and Johnson there is an expressed exception, a due process exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.852" offset="13045091">There would be none under Illinois law specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.055" offset="13057944">There is nothing in Illinois that leads to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.598" offset="13068079">The last point I would make is the analogy between or the analogies made between Bloom, Duncan, Griffin, relative to the effect on the fact finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.323" offset="13122936">Coleman dealt with a Sixth Amendment right to counsel just as Gideon dealt with the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.697" offset="13156477">Bloom and Duncan in order to assume a lack of fairness would have had to assume that the judge that heard the case was prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.989" offset="13197646">Griffin concluded that this was a Fifth Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.274" offset="13218753">In this case, Coleman is a Sixth Amendment protection and the Sixth Amendment protection at a judicial proceeding and this is in a -- we feel that the exception is broad enough here to the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.575" offset="13263997">The differences are clear enough as to one claim of retroactivity.</text>
