            <text syncTime="42.311" offset="242899">I represent the petitioner Donald Brooks who was convicted of the offense of armed robbery on the laws of the State of Tennessee and sentence to 10 years in state penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.235" offset="278634">Because I consider this to be a novel question of law, I would like to very briefly spend some time on the facts of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.012" offset="313743">The sole question which the Court has issued has granted certiorari is to whether the -- is on the question of whether the Trial Court was in error in refusing to allow the defendant to be placed on the witness stand after other witnesses testified in his behalf under Tennessee Code Section 40-2403 as said Tennessee statute requiring defendant to be the first witness is unconstitutional in violation of the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution in Article 1, Section 9 of the Tennessee Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.755" offset="440698">This question is presented into two phrases and the other section was said the Code Section 40-2403 deprives a defendant of due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.114" offset="494092">Now this question, the statute that involved for this particular matter was enacted in Tennessee in 1887.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.675" offset="536411">I would like to very briefly present to what matter in which this case -- this question was raise at the Trial Court and to do that, I would very briefly like to direct your attention to pages 1 through 3 of the appendix in which is an excerpt of the transcript of the testimony of that particular trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.231" offset="606628">From the page 1, my question regard to a motion that Court have decided in the presence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.484" offset="631601">I know Your Honor of course they submitted for the record, I know what the law is but it is something that I would like to reserve for the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.994" offset="657619">At this time of course you realize we have a statute in Tennessee which states that the defendant has to testify first.</text>

            <text syncTime="160.844" offset="717074">And I would like -- I have two other witnesses, I have another witness, two more witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.627" offset="732225">I use chief points to put on the stand and I would like to reserve the right to call Mr. Brooks after they have testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.255" offset="754690">If the fact should want and that's my motion I would like to. The Court in oppose it well at this time the Assistant District Attorney General Mr. Donald Pugh interposed who said, "Sir, we'll waive the statute if you would waive the statute."</text>
            <text syncTime="183.504" offset="807666">The court responded, "No sir, I am going to follow the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.233" offset="818638">The law is as you know it to be that if defendant's testifies he has to testify first and so doing the recess you can consider that.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.721" offset="848522">Do you have anything else to bring before the Court before recess?"</text>
            <text syncTime="196.807" offset="860956">I made other motions and recess was taken and we came back after short recess and the Court saying further."</text>
            <text syncTime="202.556" offset="883944">Mr. Summers, you do want this witness to testify and that you're not going to use the defendant, is that correct?"</text>
            <text syncTime="209.292" offset="910798">In my response, "Not at this time, Your Honor, I will."</text>
            <text syncTime="212.029" offset="921769">The Court interposes it, "Well, I want on your motion on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.778" offset="932741">So in other words if you intend to let the defendant Brooks testify, you will have to be first."</text>
            <text syncTime="220.352" offset="955101">Mr. Summers, "Your Honor, of course I understand the course ruling of this, I would like to the purpose of the record like I explained I would like to later move put him on again if I should decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.990" offset="993658">I'll do without the presence of the jury then.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.124" offset="1002226">The Court: "Well, no I have already approved on that but I am just again reminding you in case you have thought about it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.088" offset="1026050">If you're going to use him, if you want to testify in his own behalf you will have to do it now."</text>
            <text syncTime="243.325" offset="1046948">"Alright, Your Honors, we respectfully note the exceptions."</text>
            <text syncTime="246.041" offset="1057815">This is the matter in which this question was raised in the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.920" offset="1073384">Very briefly, I would like to read for you the statute which is involved in this particular matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.425" offset="1099402">In 1887, the Tennessee General Assembly, in part of the entire statute entitled "Enact to forfeit party defendants in criminal cases to testify in their own behalf."</text>
            <text syncTime="267.405" offset="1143288">The statute is actually two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.077" offset="1149975">The first is 40-2402 which gave the defendant the right to become a witness on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.245" offset="1174634">As the second part of the statute which is 40-2403 which the Court has granted, and that means failure of defendant to testify - Order of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.970" offset="1213609">The failure of the party to testify in his own behalf shall not create any presumption against him but the defendant assigned to testify shall do so before any other testimony for the defense is heard by the Court trying the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.060" offset="1265959">Now the statute prior to 1887, the defendant was incompetent to testify in his own behalf in the State of Tennessee in the Trial Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.271" offset="1350804">Your Honor, there is a case that is cited in the brief which I believe is Clemens versus State which held that he could testify in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.973" offset="1397616">This statute enacted in 1887 in conjunction with 40-2402 is my contention that the purpose of the statute of the legislators at that time was that 40-2403 was to be a safety vow.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.334" offset="1451010">Because of this with a new concept in the -- I have cited in brief Ferguson versus Georgia in which Mr. Justice Brennan cites to history in history of the right of a defendant to testify and that this was a new concept in 1887.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.640" offset="1508270">This had just been recent enacted in several states for granting to defense the right to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.593" offset="1532094">In Tennessee, it is my opinion that the reason this was enacted was as a safety vow because it was a fear and it's cited by Whitmore (ph) in the brief and the State relies on it considerably in their brief that it was that -- this would incur perjury that it would give a defendant the opportunity and they would be afraid that he would color his testimony having the right to sit there as a witness after witness standing hearing his own witnesses testify and then mold or adopt his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.841" offset="1649018">Now this was the - actually it was raised and the Tennessee adopted the statute in 1887.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.229" offset="1670543">It is our contentions that this cite in the brief that under the constitutional grounds that this fear of the legislature is not sufficient that the constitutional violation is in the Fifth, Fourteenth and Sixth Amendments of United States Constitution Article 1, Section 9 overcome this and make it imperative that we ask the Court to reverse this conviction and declare this statute unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.082" offset="1789975">Mr. Justice Stewart the Tennessee and Kentucky are the only two states and these are some of the reasons that I would like to urge the point while I am urging that this decision be declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.516" offset="1831771">Tennessee and Kentucky are the only two states at my research have been able to find and the state agrees to have this type of statute. Now there is of course there is no federal rule and this federal rule that requires this and 18 U.S.C.A. 3481 allows the defendant to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.621" offset="1900212">That's the federal statute granting him to accomplish and to testify, there is nothing that states when he must testify.</text>
