            <label>Ms. Margie Pitts Hames</label>
            <text syncTime="55.200" offset="324211">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.648" offset="325987">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.857" offset="338840">This is an appeal from a decision in the Northern District Court of Georgia where the three-judge Court below held portions of a Model Penal Code type abortion statute unconstitutional and upheld other provisions, and refused to issue an injunction in support of a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.494" offset="413341">The case was filed on behalf of Mary Doe a pregnant woman, doctors, nurses, ministers, social workers, and family planning organizations as a class action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.082" offset="467675">The District Court found that the right of privacy there did include the right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy without hanging the case on any particular provision in the constitution that rely primarily on this Court’s decision in Griswold.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.596" offset="537788">The Court found that the specification of three reasons for abortion in our statute was unduly restrictive and overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.485" offset="581360">Mary Doe was given a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.271" offset="596407">However, the physicians and other parties, even though said to have sufficient standing, lacked sufficient collision of interests and, therefore, the case was dismissed as to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.909" offset="643009">This case stands on similar jurisdictional grounds as the Roe versus White case which we just heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.196" offset="672162">I would only point to two cases on the jurisdictional point.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.063" offset="691597">One is Wisconsin versus Constantineau which dealt with a third party’s constitutional right there, and then the discussion in the Eisenstadt versus Baird case, the recent case of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.065" offset="747604">The facts of this case involved Mary Doe who was a 22-year-old woman, married.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.757" offset="770382">She had given birth to three previous children, two of whom had been taken away from her by state authorities because she was unable to care for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.051" offset="803610">The third child, she was required by her husband to place with adoptive parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.678" offset="826075">Mrs. Doe requested an abortion at the public hospital where she was entitled to free medical service.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.296" offset="852511">She was an indigent person, by the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.653" offset="865991">Her-- Mary had been unstable, and during the pendency of her pregnancy her husband abandoned her.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.418" offset="893053">She was about 10 or 11 weeks when this lawsuit was commenced, and she subsequently applied to private physicians in Atlanta in a private hospital for an abortion and that application was approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.018" offset="951463">She was turned down, however, by the public hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.752" offset="974346">The abortion statute in Georgia, as I said, is modeled after the Model Penal Code and was adopted in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.629" offset="1001932">The prior law was adopted in 1976 and it was of the Texas type to save the life of the woman statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.608" offset="1037772">The legislature in 1968, however, permitted abortion for three reasons: rape, likelihood of grave and permanent or irremediable fetal malformation and danger to the life of the woman or serious and permanent injury to her health.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.705" offset="1106213">These were the reasons the Court declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.689" offset="1122095">They left standing, however, the procedures in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.495" offset="1137351">The residency requirement, the requirement that a doctor have two consultants, the hospital abortion committee approval requirement of at least three more doctors, and the requirement that all abortions be performed in accredited licensed hospitals, that is those accredited by the Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation, and there were several other reporting requirements that were left standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.792" offset="1238497">Appellants here contend that it’s not necessary to debate the fetal life problem in the Georgia case because, as the District Court recognized, the Georgia statute is aimed at protecting the health of the woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.181" offset="1292100">Judge Smith said that the whole thrust of the present statute is to treat the problem as a medical one.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.600" offset="1317804">The only compelling interest that has been asserted by the state, however, is the interest in preserving fetal life.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.652" offset="1346017">In taking this position, the state has found itself in a very-- several inconsistent positions, that is they have abandoned the fetuses that are products of rape, they have abandoned those that might likely be malformed, and they have abandoned those that might injure the life or the health of the woman, so that if the state claims an interest in fetal life there, they have abandoned some and are protecting others.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.612" offset="1461791">The state is in the further inconsistent position because, under its public health code and family planning service it has-- as a medical service, inserted several thousand intrauterine devices which substantial medical opinion holds either destroys the product of conception or prevents implantation of the fertilized egg or embryo.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.372" offset="1572864">The brief on behalf of the state has argued that the right to life begins at the moment of conception, and we report this out as another inconsistency in their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.184" offset="1632110">Abortion is not a new medical procedure or maybe it’s not a new procedure, I should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.979" offset="1659277">Illegal abortions have been performed for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.158" offset="1672025">There aren’t any statistics that are very reliable on this, but writers in the area estimate several thousand per year in the United States and several thousand deaths have occurred from illegal abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.938" offset="1735137">I think the real abortion that this Court is faced with is whether abortion is going to be made a legal health service for women or whether it’s going to be kept in the illegal rim and handled by the unskilled so-called non-medical practitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.553" offset="1805563">I believe I’ve pointed out before in the prior argument that we have had some-23-- 25 cases now reported involving abortions in Georgia and many of those involved nurses or contractors and, I believe, a plumber in one case, and you can find those kinds of cases all over the United States, woman placing their hands-- their life in the hands of an unskilled abortionist.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.189" offset="1928129">Therefore, we feel that the statute must be viewed in the health context.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.813" offset="1954670">1,579 women received abortions in Georgia in 1971 and 3,410 Georgia women went to New York for abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.303" offset="2000541">We do not have any statistics available for the District of Columbia, California, and other more liberal states.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.583" offset="2033664">I give you these statistics to show that there is still a considerable limitation on the availability of abortion services in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.138" offset="2075878">I think the reasons that these limitations are there are apparent from the face of the statute as it remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.570" offset="2109628">The procedures are the three doctors, two consultants, and a hospital abortion committee of three doctors, is on its face a very time consuming procedure not only for the woman, but for the doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.147" offset="2172008">Of course, time is a very important factor in the decision to terminate a pregnancy for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.129" offset="2211924">The risk to a woman’s life does increase as time goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.303" offset="2232613">First trimester abortions are safer than a lot of late abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.673" offset="2254033">Complications are three to four times higher in the second trimester.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.785" offset="2286529">In a study that was conducted at the public hospital in Atlanta which is cited in our original brief at page 36, Doctors Baker and Freeman showed that 54% of the applicants for abortion were forced to discontinue their application all together, so their alternatives were to go to New York if they had money and they wouldn’t have been applying to the public hospital in the first place because they would’ve been ineligible for the treatment there, or to resort to a $50-illegal abortion in Atlanta, or of course $500-illegal abortion in Atlanta would’ve been available to them, or to place the child for adoption or rear the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.493" offset="2457370">That study further showed that by the end of the work up period of all the paper work that 56% of those applicants of that hospital had become second trimester pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.019" offset="2507421">That is, later procedure, the saline procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.870" offset="2534902">Not only is this a time consuming procedure, it is costly to the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.797" offset="2562591">We now can-- abortions in Georgia, Atlanta costs from $400 to $600.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.830" offset="2586728">That is a hospital abortion under all of the procedures of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.277" offset="2608462">You can pay airplane fair and go to New York for an abortion for about $225.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.763" offset="2634376">So, it’s no wonder that so many women choose the alternative of going away from home for abortion services.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.114" offset="2663842">They cannot afford the three consultants and to check into a hospital in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.282" offset="2688502">In addition, we feel that the procedures are not fair to the woman or the doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.983" offset="2719326">There is no hearing before the abortion committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.297" offset="2732596">There is no right for the woman to be heard at any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.274" offset="2744508">Some abortion committees do permit doctors to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.470" offset="2765302">Some of them transact their hospital abortion committee business by telephone, some by review of charts only.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.405" offset="2796962">There is no right on behalf of the woman to know the reason why she’s turned down and there’s no right to have a review of the decision and the committee procedure, we contend, is in it of itself an invasion of the patient’s privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.626" offset="2877837">Not only must she reveal to her doctor the private information or the private reasons for which she wants an abortion, but they are then-- this information, she has to give it to two other consultants.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.782" offset="2930500">The hospital abortion committee becomes a permanent part of the records that stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.689" offset="2950144">So, we feel that the whole committee procedure is devoid of fairness and due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.140" offset="2983894">It also raises a substantial conflict of interest problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.152" offset="3003956">This is primarily because of the doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.037" offset="3039483">The limitation of abortions to accredited hospitals is also limiting the availability of this service to Georgia women.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.434" offset="3077099">The Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation privilege-- requirement rather, I believe, is contained in only 4 of the 13 ALI type statutes, and this is not included as a recommendation in the Uniform Abortion Act which was last February, approved by the American Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.815" offset="3162676">In the recent case, Kansas and Maryland both recognized that this place has a substantial limitation on the availability of facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.579" offset="3201651">Even in Maryland where only two hospitals were not accredited, the Court recognized that, and in Georgia we have some 150-- at about 159 counties, only 54 have accredited hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.244" offset="3276361">We say that the Georgia statute-- in this Georgia statute, it is said that the JCAH is to establish standards for the hospital abortion committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.309" offset="3332577">We have argued that this is an unlawful delegation of legislative authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.059" offset="3359640">They-- in fact, JCAH just does not operate in this manner or in this area, and it is recognized principle of law in Georgia that delegation of legislative authority to private individuals or private organizations is an imperfect delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.447" offset="3445112">Also, we would point out that the limitation to accredited hospitals is shown to be unwarranted by the New York experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.352" offset="3484818">There was an article in Sunday’s New York Times which reported the substantial number of abortions in New York, but most significantly found that there were only 4.6 tests per 100,000 live births the first year and 3.5 the second year so that the New York clinical experience is proved to be successful.</text>

            <text syncTime="1666.205" offset="6768201">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.451" offset="6785128">Underlying this suit is an appeal by pregnant women to the Federal Judiciary and, particularly, this Court for an annunciation that they have a right secured by our constitution to procure the destruction of their living unborn children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.789" offset="6850539">They make this plea because the people of the State of Georgia forbid abortion except in certain circumstances which the people of the state through our legislature believe constitute justifiable homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.342" offset="6900694">I do not directly represent the unborn children here, nor the child of Mary Doe who is probably now two years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.263" offset="6940400">Their representation by a guardian at litem was denied by the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.106" offset="6963806">I do, however, represent three state and local officials of the government at this argument and, at that capacity, I do represent the state in defending the statute attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.215" offset="7012185">The state is parens patriae here, exerting the power of guardianship over persons on a disability standing as it were in local parentis or in place of the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.298" offset="7068609">Here, the mother, in defending the unborn child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.682" offset="7086059">Now, before we get into whatever issues there may be before this Court, with respect to that very basic fundamental underlying issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.072" offset="7127646">I think we must look at it in the context of the jurisdiction of this Court for which the proposition in presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.923" offset="7167039">Mary Doe and the other appellants, whom I wish to prefer to as plaintiffs because I think they had no business here as the parents, brought this action under Section 12-- excuse me, 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.013" offset="7227434">This is a 1983 action which was brought in the Federal Court below and a three-judge Court was requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.910" offset="7258990">That action which gives them a cause or a right of our claim says that every person who under color of any state statute subjects or cause to be subjected any citizen to the deprivation of any rights which are protected by the constitution has a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.772" offset="7342477">So, we must start out first with what right under the constitution is being abridged or what right is Mary Doe and the other plaintiffs alleging exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.574" offset="7405693">The burden is on Mary Doe to show what the constitutional right is in the first place before she has a course of action, and that question comes before this Court because this Court has not yet ruled on its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.505" offset="7465357">Its jurisdiction depends on the jurisdiction of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.419" offset="7481031">If the District Court didn’t have jurisdiction over this 1983 case, obviously there would be no jurisdiction in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.605" offset="7517811">Now, to begin with, since she must show what this right is and the burden in on her, this Court could decide that question which is a part of its jurisdictional question because if there was no constitutional right in the beginning, then the District Court had no business looking at the state statute and measuring it against that constitutional right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2022.242" offset="8192293">Now the burden, as I said, is on the woman who is exerting this so-called right to establish that she has it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2034.381" offset="8240880">There is no such right and for several reasons that I think are very fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.904" offset="8267003">Abortion, of course, is the killing of a human fetus or embryo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.362" offset="8284871">The victim of criminal abortion is the fetus, not the mother.</text>

            <text syncTime="2051.612" offset="8309844">So, it’s a crime recognized by the state against the unborn child, and that was one reason why I brought to your attention that little booklet established by the state in 1922 in a supplemental authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.609" offset="8357804">It’s called in loco parentis and it was published by the State Welfare Department and it has to do with all the statutes of the state and the decisions of the state protecting children and under the catching laws protecting children are crimes against children and that’s where abortion is discussed, 1922.</text>

            <text syncTime="2926.491" offset="11809311">Look also at the exceptions, the three exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.431" offset="11825089">If it were that the purpose of the exceptions was any time that it was for the woman’s desire or want, it would deal only with her own health, but the exception are only when extreme circumstances of self-preservation or self-defense as far as she’s concerned, not things that have to do with her health.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.595" offset="11913801">So, I think the statute itself shows that the underlying purpose is the protection of fetal life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.282" offset="11940551">Also, I think that, very clearly, the part that was struck out by the Court below with respect to the action which was a statutory action to be brought in a Superior Court for the trial of the fetus’ underlying constitutional or other rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.088" offset="12003767">That shows clearly that the legislature’s purpose was to protect the fetus from being destroyed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3000.724" offset="12106271">I’d like to point out at this juncture again, with respect to jurisdiction, that the right which Mary Doe is asserting here as being protected by the constitution is really not the right that she asserts in her brief, and I say that for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.561" offset="12185579">She doesn’t disagree with the Court below and the statute that it made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.409" offset="12205014">Although it found the basis of the statute or the purpose of the statute to be health oriented, it said the state has some interest in protecting fetal life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.519" offset="12249422">The state does have an interest which it can assert by statute and, therefore, the District Court-made statute recognized from the very beginning that there was something protectable by the state prior to birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.205" offset="12328208">So, I say that Mary Doe is beat from the beginning because she doesn’t come to this Court and say the District Court’s statute is overbroad, but she only says that it’s vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.055" offset="12395604">So that, what we have here is not a question as to whether a woman has a constitutional right to abort any pregnancy, but whether she has one in the terms that the District Court outlined, that is one that is not necessary in the best clinical judgment of the physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.848" offset="12474807">Now, I say that supports the state’s physician because that’s a recognition by the Court below that there is protectable fetal life and that it becomes a matter of degree how far the state can go in protecting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.830" offset="12546696">And, the District Court below said that, under the constitution, the state can only protect it if it is necessary to take the fetal life for the health of the mother, whereas the state legislature said “no, it’s more protectable than that” and where our regard to allow abortions, except in the three unusual extreme circumstances which we set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.368" offset="12656828">So, the District Court was not making a judgment based on constitution but a value judgment once it had already accepted the proposition that there was protectable human life involved in the destruction of an unborn human child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.557" offset="12725582">So--</text>

            <text syncTime="3155.661" offset="12726000">I take it you’d have no difficulty, from the position you’ve indicated, you’d have no difficulty in sustaining statute if the legislature prescribed one set of standards for the first trimester or the first 140 days under a more rigorous standard after that period.</text>

            <text syncTime="3176.855" offset="12810742">That’s right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.857" offset="12814817">I think it is a matter of degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.623" offset="12821817">I think it’s a value judgment that is best left in the hands of the legislature to determine in this gray area of prior to birth, what human rights are there prior to birth, and I say it is also for the reason that, under our constitution, we’ve talked a lot about the term “person” but the term “person” is not defined in the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.307" offset="12912619">And, as we said earlier, the constitution of course is the living document and, today, we know more medically and under science with respect to personhood and what occurs prior to birth and what the movement is and at what stage it’s on, what a person is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.110" offset="12991822">And, I think that the state has an interest in protecting, as far as it can, that life and that’s illustrated by this criminal abortion law that Georgia has in the context of its many statutes which protect fetal life in various forms and the decisions of its Courts over the years which say time after time after time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.013" offset="13091401">Beginning with that at least the 1849 case, we are going to consider an unborn child and ventra saunier as being in rerum natura, that is in the secular world where it’s in its own interest to do so, so that it’s part of Georgia’s whole public policy to protect the fetal life which it is seeking to protect in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.098" offset="13207803">Now, there is one other basis, I think, or at least two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.502" offset="13225357">Of course, it wants to protect the health of the mother and that’s why it allows these exceptions, at least the exception for her own health in her own life and the rape exception protects her mental health.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.739" offset="13274363">But, there is also the basis that the state wants to protect not only health.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.185" offset="13292126">As I said, primarily, it was for the protection of the fetal life and also for the general welfare to protect the public ethic, as Mr. Justice Blackmun suggested, the Hippocratic Oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.588" offset="13341759">The state has an obligation to uphold the general welfare which includes how a government protects the individuals that live in it, and I would suggest that this is an emanation of that or a manifestation of that obligation on government because the natural right which an unborn fetus has to continue its existence without being disturbed, it’s right to be let alone which is recognized in natural law and has been recognized in the common law under Blackstone &amp; Co. and those authorities which were accepted, by the way, by the Georgia Courts, they didn’t have all the cases necessarily from England but they relied on Blackstone &amp; Co. as shown in the decisions which they rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.812" offset="13538617">So, it was regarded as a protectable right in the very beginning of our state’s existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.791" offset="13586578">I think this is a particularly critical area where what Mr. Justice Powell said in Chadwick versus Tampa very recently is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.593" offset="13633703">He said that our federal system warrants of converting desirable practices into constitutional commandment, and I think that’s what’s being asked for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.002" offset="13671424">I think that’s what Mary Doe is asking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.173" offset="13684067">For her desire or a desirable practice getting into all the health significances of infant mortality or maternal mortality, that may be desirable, but let’s not turn it into a constitutional commandment because it isn’t there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.822" offset="13738611">If there’s anything emanating from the Ninth Amendment, it’s the fetus’ right to be left alone and his own self-preservation which is the ultimate responsibility of government to protect.</text>
