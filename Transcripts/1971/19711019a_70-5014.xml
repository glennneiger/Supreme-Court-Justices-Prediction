            <text syncTime="79.672" offset="392319">Of course we are dealing with legal issues here so that colloquialism really is not very relevant, is it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="patrick_t_murphy" startTime="86.267" stopTime="150.925">
            <label>Mr. Patrick T. Murphy</label>
            <text syncTime="86.267" offset="418755">I assume not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.450" offset="431503">Joan Stanley died and sometime thereafter Peter Stanley asked his long time and trusted friend, the Nesses to care for his children.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.784" offset="468806">Two months thereafter a dependency petition was filed in Juvenile Court of Cook County and there was a finding of dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.892" offset="501198">It is much as -- and the children were made wards of the Juvenile Court of Cook County.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.177" offset="522409">In as much as a finding of wardship as a final order, his only way to get around this order was to appeal which he did do.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.957" offset="565459">Now the issue in this case is whether -- is simply whether it is a denial of equal protection for the State of Illinois not to recognize Peter Stanley for what he was, that is the father of this two minor children and the non-neglectful father of this two minor children and whether it was a denial of equal protection for the State of Illinois who treated Peter Stanley as something less than a stranger that is giving no right to custody control or even visitation with his two minor children.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="150.925" stopTime="160.752">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="150.925" offset="677368">Was there in any occasion in that procedure that you have just described to determine paternity of the children?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="patrick_t_murphy" startTime="160.752" stopTime="364.937">
            <label>Mr. Patrick T. Murphy</label>
            <text syncTime="160.752" offset="716656">No, it was assumed by the state’s attorney and by the Trial Court and by all parties that he was the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.117" offset="746122">In fact, the assistant state’s attorney did state that there was no -- that they were contending that Peter Stanley was not the father of the two children, that never became an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.864" offset="809129">Of course for equal protection analysis a classification must be reasonable and not arbitrary and rest upon some ground of difference having a fair in substantial relation to the object of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.240" offset="850612">So that all persons similarly situated shall be treated a like.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.373" offset="867121">Further of course, certain interests that are disadvantaged require a more strict scrutiny by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.144" offset="894288">Now it is difficult for us to argue as to just what the state purpose is behind the statute, behind this discriminatory classification are.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.604" offset="932114">The State and the Illinois Supreme Court argued one purpose in its brief in opposition filed in this Court argue the second purpose and its brief in this Court seem to argue yet another purpose to make the statutory scheme stand the scrutiny of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.235" offset="1010586">However, there seems to be a threat running through it and that is that somehow it is in the best interest of minor children that their fathers who have built up familiar relationships, but who have never married their mothers be treated as strangers to the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.347" offset="1071085">However, an analysis of Illinois Law and of the historical background in Illinois law will demonstrate, we believe that the purpose behind the discriminatory scheme in Illinois was simply for the better administration of the Illinois Adoption Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.316" offset="1158961">Now, the state alleges that the welfare of children in Illinois is promoted by the making of the illegitimate father a stranger to his child by faired out good and bad unwed fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.051" offset="1253838">We believe that an examination of this will show that this was not the purpose of the general assembly and secondly even assuming it were that there simply is no rational relationship between this alleged purpose and the classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.196" offset="1326458">First of all it does not faired out good and bad unwed fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.950" offset="1341505">It merely grants to the uninterested in abandoning and perhaps neglectful unwed father his wish of not being a father to the children and allowing him to do what he wishes to.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.156" offset="1382256">It places the burden upon the unwed father like Peter Stanley to come in and show by a greater burden of proof than a neglectful parent has to that he wants his children.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.213" offset="1434501">But the state simply does, it takes the children away from the parent, places them in either an orphanage or a foster home and then tells the father, if you want them back you must go back to Adoption Court and show not that you are non-neglectful and not that you are something less than indigent, but that you are not indigent and that you are very suitable parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.158" offset="1530318">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="381.279" offset="1598759">Peter Stanley was in the same position as any wed father would have been whose wife had just died and who was also indigent.</text>

            <label>Mr. Patrick T. Murphy</label>
            <text syncTime="390.633" offset="1636166">He left his children with his long time and trusted friend, the Nesses and he said, “Would you take care of them?”</text>
            <text syncTime="395.497" offset="1655706">It is in the record, same thing that a wed father might have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.403" offset="1671274">So obviously, Stanley was in no position to care for his children.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.129" offset="1682246">Furthermore the probation officer states that Peter Stanley was indigent, so he has -- he is indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.072" offset="1705965">He is in a position not to care for his children at that time, of course he could not adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.025" offset="1725818">There is no Court in the world that would have allowed Stanley to adopt his children plus having the opprobrium of being an unwed father and all through its brief the state says unwed fathers are bad people or historically we know they are abandoning people and then they come across and say, well all Stanley has to do his run down to the adoption Court to adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.828" offset="1796976">The same opprobrium which the State attaches to Stanley in its brief the adoption Court is going to attach that Stanley also.</text>

            <text syncTime="482.990" offset="2005642">No and for this reason that after the Stanley decision came down from the Illinois Supreme Court, the Illinois Appellate Court in the case of the Vandolin v. Vandolin (ph) upheld the former Illinois Supreme and Appellate Court decisions in denying the putative father even the right to visit his children.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.357" offset="2063111">And in fact pursuant to that decision, the attorney general’s office moved in the Juvenile Court to terminate all visitations between Stanley and his children and the Juvenile Court in fact did terminate such visitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.145" offset="2110236">It was only after this Court granted certiorari that they even allowed Stanley to start visiting his children again.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.695" offset="2136463">So as a theoretical –- it was theoretically impossible, even practically it was out of the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1350.589" offset="5476061">I would like to point out that the adoption that it is our point of view -- that it is what we believe that the statutory scheme is what is it is because general assembly wished to make plans for the better administration of the Adoption Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.039" offset="5549831">Between the years 1827 and 1949 in Illinois, unwed fathers had the right to custody of their children merely for the asking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.458" offset="5583477">Between 1827 and 1872, all they had to do is demand from the unwed mother the child and she had to deliver them up or the father could stop support payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.590" offset="5620048">Between 1872 and 1949, it was after the child’s tenth birthday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.151" offset="5638334">In 1946, the Illinois attorney general issued an opinion which held that was stated that adoption agencies would after that point have to notify any unwed father of adoption proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.275" offset="5698729">And if in fact, the unwed father were unknown then the guardian would have to be appointed for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.665" offset="5724329">In 1949, the First Convenient General Assembly thereafter the Illinois State Legislature amended the act to state which the predecessor of today’s Paternity Act that no unwed father would have any right to custody or control over his children and in Illinois Law Review article that we cite here point out that this was merely to amend the Paternity Act to keep it in line with the Adoption Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.637" offset="5836238">The Juvenile Court Act was passed in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.987" offset="5849612">There is no historical background on why unwed fathers are excluded from the definition of parents except the obvious one of making this in line with the Paternity and Adoption Acts in the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.842" offset="5897051">And it seems quite obvious that better administration of the Adoption Act is not a compelling reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.283" offset="5922860">In fact, it is not rationally related at all to the classification here and as a practical matter, it does not succeed in what it wants to do because again it merely allows the uninterested, abandoning and unknown unwed fathers not to come into Court while it forces the suitable and caring for unwed fathers to come to Court to demand some type custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.526" offset="6035813">And if in fact, the Adoption Act actually did force these unwed fathers to come before it, it would merely clog the Adoption Courts with unwed, but suitable fathers seeking to adopt their own children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.333" offset="6090984">I think what happened here, we believe what happened here is that the general assembly never considered this subclass of the fathers and simply made a law to make the Juvenile Court Act fit in with the Adoption Act never considering unwed but familial fathers and of course this type of father like Japanese, Chinese and Black people and indigent criminal appellants did not have at that time much of a lobby in the state legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.832" offset="6209057">So for the reasons which we have stated in the brief, for the reasons we have argued, we would ask that this Court reverse the opinion of the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1552.119" offset="6282200">Petitioner before this Court seeks automatic legal control of these persons -- these children assumed to be his.</text>

            <text syncTime="3537.954" offset="14225514">There is no evidence there was not Joan Stanley would not marry Peter Stanley and we can assume that in many cases it is the woman who will not marry the man and not the man who refuses to marry the woman.</text>
