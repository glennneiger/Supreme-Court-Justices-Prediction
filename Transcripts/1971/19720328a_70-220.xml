            <label>Mr. Charles H. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="17.285" offset="142814">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.547" offset="159846">Mr. David Ferber, the Solicitor of the Securities and Exchange Commission and I have divided our time so that I will take the first 30 minutes and Mr. Ferber, 15 minutes with respect to the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.961" offset="217524">Mr. Ferber is similarly arguing for a reversal of the order of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.848" offset="253050">This case is before this Court on the writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.159" offset="282308">The case involves the standing of a bankruptcy reorganization trustee, a Chapter X Trustee to prosecutor a claim in the reorganization proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.080" offset="330059">I will discuss that claim as I spell out for the Court the facts with respect to those matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.886" offset="357227">The courts below dismissed the trustees’ complaint and dismissed the other claims sought to be prosecuted by the trustee by a way of counter claim on the ground that the trustee had no standing to bring the claims which are in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.746" offset="424727">The petitioner in this matter is Mortimer M. Caplin.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.207" offset="442490">Mr. Caplin was named in May of 1965 by the United States District Court, for the Southern District of New York as the reorganization trustee under Chapter X of Webb &amp; Knapp, Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.567" offset="499960">At one time before its troubles, which led Webb &amp; Knapp into the reorganization court, that that company was one of the largest real estate companies in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.349" offset="551055">The defendant in this case is the Marine Midland Grace Trust Company of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.434" offset="575402">Marine Midland was the trustee under a trust indenture with respect to an issue of 5% debentures of the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.457" offset="615526">There are still approximately $4,200,000.00 of these debentures outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.106" offset="646141">In the trust indenture, a copy of which has been lodged with this Court, there were certain covenants, which were made by the debtor for the benefit of the debenture holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.856" offset="697132">The single most important covenant for the purposes of this case was a covenant that the debtor would not incur any indebtedness or purchase any real property, unless its tangible assets were twice its liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.720" offset="764528">That is the Section 3.6 of the Trust Indenture and that provision, which we call the Asset to Liability Ratio Provision, is at the heart of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.576" offset="811966">There were certifications required by the debtor to Marine Midland, the indenture trustee, year after year to the effect that the debtor was not in default in connection with these debentures.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.985" offset="873615">Now, the Marine Midland requested appraisals with respect to the value of the real property here, because the principal assets of this corporation was real estate and from year-to-year, starting in or about 1957 at least, the debtor’s offices furnished the Marine Midland appraisals as to their opinion as to the value of the real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.078" offset="990017">This was all for purposes of this Asset to Liability Ratio and ensuring that the debtor would not purchase more real property or incur more indebtedness unless the asset to liability ratio were indeed two to one as the covenant provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.077" offset="1062010">Now, these certificates and these appraisals, were accepted year after year by Marine Midland without any question being raised at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.253" offset="1110703">After Mr. Caplin was named as Reorganization Trustee, he commenced his statutory investigation of the debtors’ affairs under Chapter X of Chandler Act and he found that the appraisals and that the certificates, submitted annually by the debtors directors and offices, were in fact false and fraudulent on their face and that Marine Midland knew or should have known that this appraisals were inflated.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.997" offset="1233687">He further found that Marine Midland willfully disregarded these appraisals and these certificates and was grossly negligent in failing to recognize how false they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.201" offset="1278513">In fact, the trustee and reorganization, Mr. Caplin found at no time during the period between 1957 and 1965 had the required two to one tangible asset to liability ratio have been maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.690" offset="1344446">We have in the petitioner's main brief at page four, an indication of one example of the kind of appraisals about which we are talking.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.989" offset="1393661">There are certain parcel of real property in Bronx County in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.128" offset="1414246">That real property with a net book value of $2,800,000.00 had been appraised by the debtors offices at $15,000,000.00 in 1957, $27.5 million in 1958, one year later in 1959 at more than double that amount, $64 million and the same in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.314" offset="1506928">And by 1963, the same parcel without any significant improvements on it have been appraised by the debtors offices at -- 80% of it had been appraised at $91 million so that the whole parcel had to be appraised at more than a $100 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.766" offset="1580802">This is just one example of the kind of appraisals that were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.800" offset="1604939">Now, as a result of his investigation, the reorganization trustee determined that it was the gross negligence or willful misconduct, not simple negligence but gross or willful misconduct, by Marine Midland, which had permitted the debtor to continue this course of activity or buying more real estate and entering in the transactions involving tens of millions of dollars and incurring more indebtedness and that this led inexorably to the reorganization court where Webb &amp; Knapp found itself in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.574" offset="1747986">Indeed, it was charged by the reorganization trustee, Mr. Caplin in that complaint which was in question here and which we are seeking to have reinstated that it was the bank's failure to enforce this two to one asset to liability ration and his failure by having received and accepted without question these appraisals and these certificates which were clearly false on their face, which caused a net worth of this company to be reduced from $25 million in December 1958 to a negative net worth, a deficit figure of $38.5 million at the time that the reorganization proceeding commenced.</text>

            <text syncTime="481.274" offset="1998762">That is the question before this Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles H. Miller</label>

            <text syncTime="521.993" offset="2161661">Yes.</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_h_miller" startTime="522.498" stopTime="835.514">
            <label>Mr. Charles H. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="522.498" offset="2163646">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.035" offset="2169811">Now, the reorganization trustee Mr. Caplin, petitioned in the district court, in the reorganization court for the right to start a plainary action against Marine Midland for the benefit of debenture holders and the court granted permission for Mr. Caplin to do so and then on the motion of Marine Midland, the court dismissed the complaint on the ground that under Second Circuit (Inaudible) Clarke against Chase National Bank in 1943 decision in the Second Circuit, the reorganization trustee had no standing and was not the real party of interest and had no standing to prosecutor a personal claim on behalf of debenture holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.153" offset="2334278">The district court held that it was bound by the Clarke decision, that the property involved was acclaimed personal to the debenture holders and did not involve property of the estate and it also held that it would not affect a plan of reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.006" offset="2397704">Under Clarke, the reorganization trustee has the authority and has standing to sue on behalf of debenture holders if either property of the debtor is involved or the matter would affect the plan of reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.277" offset="2458830">The district held that it would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.536" offset="2467816">We then went to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.289" offset="2482863">There was an argument held before three judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.967" offset="2493521">Two of the three judges would have overruled the Clarke decision and held that the trustee had standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.801" offset="2520897">The reorganization trustee had standing, but the Second Circuit in accordance with its time honored rule, then submitted the matter en banc to the full Second Circuit without further argument on the briefs already submitted and held with five to two that there was no standing on behalf of the reorganization trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.859" offset="2597175">The Second Circuit in an opinion by Judge Friendly, held that the reorganization trustee had no standing, that Clarke was the proper rule and that there was no reason for this action to be brought by the reorganization trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.074" offset="2670004">There was a vigorous dissent by Judges Ervin Kaufman and Paul Hays to the effect that there was no reason for the Clarke rule and the somewhat artificial distinctions with respect to the property that were involved in that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.020" offset="2733743">And that the action should have been permitted to be brought that the reorganization trustee is indeed the proper party to bring the action, he is authorized on the statute to do so and he should have been permitted to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.143" offset="2786301">Now, we have set forth in our briefs, four principle reasons why we -- for the reorganization trustee assert that there is standing for the reorganization trustee to prosecute this action against Marine Midland on behalf of the debenture holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.747" offset="2872714">The first reason is that the congressional scheme for reorganization, which is evidenced by two significant statutory amendments in the late 1930s, just two significant statutory enactments; the Chandler Act, which sets up Chapter X and the Trust Indenture Act specifically provide for a reorganization process in which the reorganization trustee is the focal point and is taking the interests not just of the debtors, not just of the general creditors, but of the investors, stockholders, debt investors, any kind of investors and he is the focal point for all of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.109" offset="3046167">He investigates and he tries to find out what happened that led the debtor into the reorganization court.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.280" offset="3074797">He is then the proper party under the statute to prosecute any claims, which may exist against third parties or against anybody else because without his intersession, it is quite likely that in many instances at least the debenture holders will not prosecute their individual claims because many of them may in certain instances have small face amounts of debentures and they will not undergo the expense of prosecuting their own claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.044" offset="3189841">We say that in addition to that, secondly, there is specific statutory authority under the bankruptcy laws, under Chapter X for a reorganization trustee to sue a venture trustee and the kind of claim involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.723" offset="3256610">And we point to Section 587 of Title 11, which we set forth at our grief at Page 14, which specifically holds that an equity receiver that a reorganization trustee has all the powers of an equity receiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.799" offset="3324842">Now, when equity receiver, under this Court’s decision in the McCandless case in 1935, an opinion by Mr. Justice Cardozo held that an equity receiver could sue third parties to -- in affect return funds or have funds restored to the estate on behalf of investors.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="835.514" offset="3415748">Mr. Miller, would you concede that an ordinary trustee and bankruptcy would not have standing to bring an action such as you are seeking to bring here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="842.433" stopTime="1073.777">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="842.433" offset="3443437">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.918" offset="3445318">We are focusing Mr. Justice Rehnquist only on the power of the Chapter X reorganization trustees.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.502" offset="3479695">Now, we say third that as a practical matter, the reorganization trustee is the best person to bring this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.226" offset="3510624">He is the best person because he has under the authority, indeed under his duty, make a total investigation of all of the facts and circumstances leading to the debtors demise.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.927" offset="3561406">He is the person before the reorganization court.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.629" offset="3572169">He has found these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.848" offset="3577080">In many instances, he has to prosecute a claim against others, directors and officers of the debtor, which involved the same facts and the same circumstances and this action has not brought either or it may not be bringable at all or it will involve redundancy of fact finding as Judge Kaufman held below.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.470" offset="3679584">Finally, we say that the holding of the court below in which a kind of hyper-technical property distinction or property holding has been super imposed on the reorganization laws, is just plain wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.173" offset="3750428">There is no need for that decision under Clarke.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.572" offset="3764012">There is a decision in the Third Circuit, Solar Electric under which this action -- this type of action was in effect, permitted to be brought as a counter claim by the trustee to the proof of claim and the accounting filed by the indenture trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.061" offset="3833916">We tried in this case to do it on the all three methods that is a plainary action, a counter claim to a proof of claim filed by the indenture trustee and also we sought to have the indenture trustee file an accounting so that we could then counter claim and all three of our rights to do so, were denied by the court’s below.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.543" offset="3915836">We are allowed, however, under the ruling of all the courts below to setup as an affirmative defense to the indenture trustees’ proof of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.490" offset="3951676">This affirmative defense that the indenture trustee was guilty of gross negligence or willful misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.313" offset="3978948">So we have to find the same facts and why we can't bring it affirmatively is one of the questions that this here before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.047" offset="4009877">Now, there are two arguments, which are raised by Marine Midland in this case, which I would like to address my attention to it very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.255" offset="4070690">In the first argument, Marine Midland tells the court about three individual cases which have been brought on behalf of debenture holders; two in the state court in New York and one in the Federal Court in New York and he says in effect, “You see, the debenture holders were represented in this case and there is not need for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.180" offset="4158461">What the trustee is attempting to do is to preempt the debenture holders.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.223" offset="4182598">Now, the facts are, as we set out in our reply brief, that each of these actions was commenced after the trustee, the reorganization trustee, filed the petition seeking leave to bring this action, after he has had ascertained all the facts and after Marine Midland had indeed interposed an objection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1154.735" offset="4692613">Now, what we are saying however is that, as a practical matter and as a matter of the statutory purpose, there was a feeling in Congress that debenture holders would not have the wherewithal or the ability to bring this kind of action and the reorganization trustee is the proper party to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.616" offset="4768159">Now, one other argument that has been raised by Marine Midland to which I would like to address myself is, the Marine Midland argument, that you go down the statute at Chapter X and you read it line by line by line and nowhere do you see any specific authority for a reorganization trustee to sue an indenture trustee on behalf of behalf of debenture holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.223" offset="4862618">Now, Marine Midland would have this Court look at a reorganization trustee and I think that this Mr. Justice Rehnquist is in part answer to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.676" offset="4912355">Not as a -- Marine Midland would have us look at a reorganization trustee as a liquidator of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.316" offset="4939000">Somebody who goes out and looks at the statute as also checklist and goes out and gets whatever property is involved there and brings whatever suits are specifically set forth there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.728" offset="4980587">That is not, we say what a reorganization trustee is all about and I think that Judge Irving Kaufman in the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said it better than I am able to say it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.148" offset="5042236">He said that the process of reorganizing and I am reading now from the dissent in the Court of Appeals at Pages 99A to 100A of the Appendix in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.368" offset="5087166">The process of reorganizing is not performed merely by a nice, sharp, precise, mathematical apportionment of a debtor’s estate according to fixed formulas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.510" offset="5127708">Rather, the objective is carried out through a process of negotiation and some give and take in an attempt to adjust equitably and with sensitivity to nuances of the individual case, the rights of competing interested parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.072" offset="5193955">And then Judge Kaufman pointed to the language, which was a little more thrust as it usually was of Judge Learned Hand in the Second Circuit in his quite vigorous dissent in the Clarke case with which we are in whole hearted agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.862" offset="5265113">Judge Learned Hand said, “The reorganization court has jurisdiction because it has an obligation to “adjust” the mutual rights of the debtors' creditors as between themselves.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.558" offset="5319970">Now, we think that the efforts of Marine Midland to super impose this state law property concept over what Congress has enacted as the policy in reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.624" offset="5384231">It should be the policy in reorganization is one, which this Court should not countenance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.015" offset="5409726">We say further that if you are looking to the statute for a specific statutory authority that a reorganization trustee has all of the powers of a receiver in equity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1525.726" offset="6176577">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.621" offset="6196221">Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act is one of the series of securities laws passed during and right after the great depression to protect the investing public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.959" offset="6273544">The commission study that led to it and to the Trust Indenture Act showed that in earlier reorganizations, generally in equity receiverships, the investors' interests were often sacrificed to the interests of the insiders throughout and after the reorganization, it was the insiders who were usually in control and stayed in control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.275" offset="6418784">And the persons who may have been responsible for the difficulties that we have encountered were rarely if ever sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.911" offset="6453370">And the SEC concluded its study with the recommendation to curb “the exploitation of investors, which has occurred either at the hands of the indenture trustee itself or at the hands of the reorganization and management groups with the knowledge, consent or acquiesce of the complacent and inactive trustee -- indenture trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.299" offset="6574892">And as this Court has pointed out with respect to others of the securities laws, we submit the Chapter X too should be construed in the language of this Court not technically and restrictively, but rather flexibly to effectuate its remedial purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.344" offset="6671023">Now, what was the remedial purpose of Chapter X?</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.218" offset="6686592">Essentially, it was to provide the means for corporate rehabilitation that would ensure that investors' losses would be kept to a minimum and that the insiders, if responsible, would be prosecuted and investors would be treated fairly and this interested trustee, the court’s own officer was basic to the statutory design.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.513" offset="6831728">The House Report pointed out that his functions “in the larger cases” are difficult to over emphasize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.313" offset="6878957">Under Section 167 of the act, he is to conduct an investigation to determine whether going concerned values can be preserved by a reorganization, to determine what causes the difficulties and whether new management should be required and what causes of action are available to the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.477" offset="6991597">Now, the respondent's brief makes quite a bit of this that its causes of actions available to the estate in Section 167.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.089" offset="7042066">I would like to point out that this is not as clear a word as the respondent suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.767" offset="7068711">It doesn’t say, what causes of action are available to the debtor, which is defined in the Act, but uses the fairly vague word to the estate and we suggest that this word can encompass the investors who are interested in the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.283" offset="7158781">The legislative history makes clear that a Chapter X debtor was to be viewed not just as a corporate entity, but as a collection of the interest of security holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.615" offset="7220117">In the sense that Chapter X trustee represents all of this security holders even when various classes of them may have somewhat conflicting interests when he works out a reorganization plan that is to be fair to all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.771" offset="7284796">Obviously, what may be -- what “one group” might consider fair to it and other group might consider as less than fear to it because there is only so much normally to go around.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.328" offset="7330980">When he brings an action on behalf of the estate, meaning strictly the debtor, it may help one class to the possible expense of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.465" offset="7367552">One of the landmark cases is a Committee against Kent in the Central States Reorganization where the Chapter X trustee wanted to determine that while there was a cause of action against some of the promoters, he felt the statute of limitations had run, and therefore, recommended that an action would not be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.996" offset="7477684">On appeal it was determined that an action should be brought despite the fact that the senior creditors opposed it because as they said, you are going to use some of what would otherwise go to worst to gamble for the benefit of juniors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.353" offset="7551140">But the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in the Committee against Kent has said that, “this is the basic duty of the Chapter X trustee where it is a comparatively small amount of money as against what might be recovered to collect these assets and determine that the lawsuit should be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.404" offset="7647271">Similarly, as was made clear to this Court a couple of years ago in the TMT case, Protective Committee against Anderson, there were settlements involved of large claims and these settlements were of such a nature that in effect they were wiping out the junior class whereas in this Court reversed apparently because of that I believe that there had not been an ample determination on the fairness of these settlements, which if settled at the substantial prices the debtor was allowing them would have pretty much wiped out stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.166" offset="7834308">Now, there are various safeguards in Chapter X for all of the investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.089" offset="7862102">Creditors and stockholders are entitled to be heard at every stage of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.642" offset="7884254">They could have come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.552" offset="7887911">I don’t know whether they did or not in this case, when the trustee asked leave to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.471" offset="7907555">But certainly, there was no reason why any creditor, any debenture holder who felt that the trustee should not be suing on his behalf could not have come in and raised that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.792" offset="7956874">They are represented by committees in many cases and also in many cases by the indenture trustee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.044" offset="7989893">Chapter X court has very specific powers only the security holders’ representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.517" offset="8019777">It may enforce an accounting under a trust indenture or with respect to security holder’s committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.691" offset="8056453">It allows compensation for services performed during the proceeding by indenture trustees and by committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.564" offset="8103996">To us, it seems that it makes a great deal of sense to have the Chapter X trustee, who has investigated and found out the facts indicating that the indenture trustee might be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.420" offset="8171392">And who would use those facts as a defense against the indenture trustees' claim for services, against the debtor for him to bring the proceeding on behalf of the debenture holders.</text>

            <text syncTime="2190.117" offset="8834170">Well, if you look at in a very broad sense perhaps as I understand the facts in that case, the promoters sold property to the debtor at a great deal less, I mean, at a great deal more than it was probably worth, they had it what appears to be a phony assessment and the promoters received these bonds, which they in turn sold to the public that the money coming to the bonds, I do not believe directly ever went to the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.948" offset="8973455">So I think while Judge Cardozo loosely spoke of it as property of the debtor, as a practical matter, it was the profits of these promoters in the sale of bonds that they had taken for their sale of property to the debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.110" offset="9034164">Now, I am maybe over simplifying, but I read it again last night, the facts are not easy, but this is the way I believe what is really involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.777" offset="9084842">The promoters would have urged, it was their property, not property of the debtor and there of course, the court did holds that the creditors, that the receiver could sue on behalf of the creditors and in that connection Justice White, I think that in the statutory language your read a bit ago, I believe they were only identifying the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.993" offset="9173658">In other words, I do not think the language of the property of the debtor was intended in any way to be restrictive and this is the way I read it and I think it is a very logical way to read it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2456.616" offset="9900175">I would like to clear away at the outset, one or two questions that I think are left open by what has gone before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.408" offset="9931313">First, it is said that Mr. Caplin found about Marine Midland’s performance that it had been grossly negligent, willfully guilty of misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.124" offset="9982200">What was being said, simply is, that Mr. Caplin is alleging that in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.214" offset="10006546">Nothing has been proved, no evidence has been taken, no discovery has been commenced, there has been no answer in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.326" offset="10039042">We are here purely and simply on the question of whether the trustee has standing to allege the claims that are set forth in his complaint here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.379" offset="10083242">There is no claim made on behalf of the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.308" offset="10098915">Nothing recovered admittedly by the commission, admittedly by the petitioner, admittedly will accrue to the benefit of the estate of Webb &amp; Knapp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.334" offset="10143010">There is no claim made here under the Trust Indenture Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.312" offset="10158892">It is not mentioned in the complaint and there is no reliance upon and jurisdiction is not invoked on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.833" offset="10193060">This is purely and simply a damage suit alleging negligence against Marine Midland under state law concepts of negligence, claiming that we should have recognized the falsity of certificates dually filed with us, pursuant to the provision of the indenture and relied on them as we were entitled to do under the terms of the indenture which in turn was a qualified indenture under the Trust Indenture Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2691.012" offset="10837762">It has been said that the answer to one of the questions was, that the creditors might get more if there were a recovery here, if the doctrine of subrogation were not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.186" offset="10898471">Now, Judge Friendly expounds the doctrine of subrogation and we think he is correct in his analysis and we have set forth additional support for that basis, for that position in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.822" offset="10956985">But the actual fact in this case is that the question is all together moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.823" offset="10984988">Nobody is going to benefit other than the debenture holders in this particular case because as this case stands, a plan of reorganization has already been proposed, has been approved by the SEC, has been submitted to Judge McClain in the Southern District of New York and in that plan of reorganization, there is provision for the debenture holders to share equally as part of the same class with the general unsecured creditors, share and share alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.413" offset="11111317">And the Securities and Exchange Commission in their comments upon the plan of reorganization which was submitted to them for their consideration, had only minor modifications to suggest and here is the modification that in the interest of full disclosure to all the interested parties in this reorganization proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.227" offset="11202641">The plan of reorganization should make absolutely clear that unlike the other claims and causes of action which the trustee is reserving and may prosecute here after, any fund that may be recovered by the trustee in the Caplin and Marine Midland litigation will inure solely to the benefit of the debenture holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.705" offset="11300548">That is conceded, that is the end of it so far as any further benefit, we suggest to the estate of the debtor or to anyone who may have any share or any claim in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3751.299" offset="15078899">What they are asking the Court to do because they cannot risk on that simple point is, to imply numerous decisions or conclusions as to numerous questions involving other statutes and other rules in the class action and securities law field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.609" offset="15168133">That is to say that to sustain their position, this Court or possibly the district court, maybe we have an agenda for years of litigation before us here if this position is sustained, either this Court or the district courts and in the Courts of Appeal and then we may be back here, we are going to have to make decisions of necessity of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.663" offset="15264368">They are going to have to imply the answer to the question whether or not the power claimed by the trustee is exclusive or not exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.819" offset="15300939">I understand they do not claim that it is not exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.247" offset="15314732">They claim that it is preferred that the trustee have this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.321" offset="15330928">They also say that as a practical matter if they have granted this power, they will in fact sweep the field clean because other debenture holder suing in their private capacity would not be inclined to risk the money and the time for what may in the end prove to be a futile action if the trustee’s action in fact is permitted to be preferred and go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="3839.088" offset="15430089">If the conclusion is that the power is not exclusive and if the conclusion is, that it is presumptively to be preferred that the trustee prosecute this action, then I ask what rule are we looking to, from what do we imply to this kind a conclusion, what rule or statute is involved here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.726" offset="15528623">And if the trustee’s power is implied not to be exclusive and not even to be presumably and presumptively preferred, but is just run a parallel with private actions brought by class claimants, private debenture holders suing in their own behalf, then where thus that leave us with respect to Rule 23 in the federal courts?</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.174" offset="15626425">Where does it leave us with respect to the confusion that would be caused in delicate state federal relations with respect to parallel class action provisions under state law?</text>

            <text syncTime="3906.579" offset="15699986">How are we going to determine the priorities between the competing suitors, the private litigants on one hand, which we have two in this case and the trustee on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3918.695" offset="15748469">There is mechanics for making that decision under Rule 23 and in the southern district of New York, there is practice of staying a federal action in favor of a state action often to let it run its course and see how it will come out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.581" offset="15811999">But these are things that are worked out and have been over the past 30 years of class action litigation under the securities laws and otherwise and under Rule 23, which suddenly are going to be thrown in the chaos when the trustee steps into the water and lends his weight here to this kind of a claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3978.519" offset="15987751">There is a suggestion in the brief that there is no reason to suppose that rules similar to Rule 23 will not be invoked here to govern this action, but which parts of that rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.586" offset="16044071">I mean, in the first place, rule of 23 cannot apply to the trustee.</text>

            <text syncTime="4112.212" offset="16522530">And I suggest Your Honor in conclusion, if the Court please in conclusion that we are opening Pandora’s Box once we cross the initial bridge of accepting the argument that is made here and the claim of standing because we have no answers to give to all the complex of questions, which then faces procedurally with respect to collateral estoppel with respect to res judicata, with respect to priorities of claim, with respect to delicate relations between the state governments and the federal governments and their respective rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="4159.857" offset="16713119">I suggest that the parade of horribles that Marine Midland has suggested that would be unleashed if the trustee were given standing in this case, it just does not exist and it does not exist for one reason and it is a reason that we assert as one of the significant reasons why the trustee should have standing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.370" offset="16803189">Everything in the reorganization is under the supervision, and the umbrella and the aegis of a reorganization court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.551" offset="16835895">It is under the aegis of a reorganization court, which has the Securities and Exchange Commission before it at every step in the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.006" offset="16869749">Before any action can be started the reorganization court gives permission to the starting of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.114" offset="16894200">Before any action can be settled, the reorganization court determines whether the settlement is fair and equitable and the reorganization court, which makes that determination, does it on the basis of a long standing knowledge of all the facts or circumstances of the debtor's estates, of the debenture holders, of all the various packages of creditor's rights which are involved here.</text>
