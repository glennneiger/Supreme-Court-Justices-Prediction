            <text syncTime="37.539" offset="223898">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.118" offset="242184">This case brings before the Court a question involving Section 16(b) of the Securities Act -- Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which relates to short swing sales transactions involving directors, officers and 10% holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.253" offset="322745">We are concerned here with the position of Emerson Electric Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.521" offset="339777">The respondent who was what, has been described as a beneficial owner under the statute in that, it was at the times that are relevant in our consideration of this question more than a 10% holder of the common stock of Dodge Manufacturing Company which was subsequently merged into Reliance Electric Company, the petitioner here in.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.376" offset="443222">Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is set out in page 2 of our brief and provides that for the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by a beneficial owner or director or officer by a reason of his relationship with the issuer that any profit realized by him from the purchasing sale or sale in purchase within a period of six months, shall be recoverable by the issuer.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.354" offset="615108">There is in 16 (b) an exemption which provides, and it is of significance in this case that the subsection shall not be construed to cover any transaction where the beneficial owner or the officer or director was not such because at the time of the purchase, end of the sale or the sale in purchase of the security involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.377" offset="719179">This action comes before the Court by a reason of a declaratory judgment which was initially filed by Emerson against Reliance asking for a declaration of its rights and obligations under Section 16(b) by reason of its, that is Emerson’s ownership of more than 10% of the stock of Dodge.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.793" offset="820848">Briefly, the relevant facts disclosed that on June 16, 1967 pursuant to a tender offer, Emerson purchased 152,282 shares of Dodge stock at $63 a share pursuant to a tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.436" offset="903395">And by that purchase became the owner of approximately 13.2% of Dodge’s outstanding stock and therefore in our view within the purview of the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="219.380" offset="951251">Mr. Mulligan, is there any suggestion anywhere here that upon or after this acquisitions through tenders, Emerson in fact possessed any insider information?</text>

            <text syncTime="234.582" offset="1012064">There is no information one way or the other in the record Your Honor as to whether they did or did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.870" offset="1045188">It is our view as I will touch on, more fully later that within the purview of the statute once they become an insider by reason of the accusation of more than 10% they are presumed and irrebuttably presumed to have inside information and to have the opportunity to exploit that inside information in whatever way they see fit.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.153" offset="1138288">That is the purport of the statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_p_mulligan" startTime="268.655" stopTime="484.082">
            <label>Mr. Thomas P. Mulligan</label>
            <text syncTime="268.655" offset="1148319">Yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.864" offset="1157201">Now at the time that Emerson made its purchase and prior there to, it knew two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.044" offset="1193877">It knew first of all that Dodge and Reliance had entered into a merger agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.639" offset="1224283">It also knew that its own management had authorized the submission of a merger proposal to Dodge.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.512" offset="1263780">This letter in fact however was not known on June 16 when Emerson made its purchase by the shareholders of Dodge nor by the public generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.949" offset="1305472">And it was not known until after Dodge or after Emerson had purchased the Dodge stock and indicated that it was going to solicit proxies to oppose the merger between Reliance and Dodge which matter was to come before a shareholders meeting of Dodge on August 22, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.467" offset="1399513">Within a few days after Dodge or Emerson had acquired its 13.2% of Dodge, it received a letter from its counsel, dated June 26, 1967 in which he outlined alternatives to a proxy fight with Dodge.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.475" offset="1475581">And principally he told them how he thought they could go about avoiding profit on the disposition of their holdings in Dodge principally by a defensive plan which would involve selling just enough of the stock to be below 10% and then the disposition of the balance so as to avoid the impact of 16 (b) and preserve the profit on the second sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.688" offset="1580489">Now, in point of fact in the proxy fight that did ensue Emerson lost and Dodge was merged into Reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.905" offset="1621344">Immediately upon the completion of the meeting at which the shareholders of Dodge approved the merger, August 22, immediately thereafter Emerson undertook the deliberate intentional disposition of its stock as rapidly as it could pursuant to the plan which had been outlined by its attorney a couple of months before.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.238" offset="1718624">On August 28, 1967 in a sale to Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, it disposed of 37,000 shares of Dodge stock which had the effect of reducing its holdings in Dodge to just below 10%, 9.96 to be exact.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.906" offset="1793335">And almost simultaneously with that disposition it entered into negotiations whereby it sold the remaining 9.96 shares to Dodge which sale was completed in early September of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.180" offset="1862402">Both of these transactions involved sales at an amount considerably an excess of what Emerson had paid for the stock so that the net result of what Emerson had done pursuant to a plan which had been in its mind while it was an insider was the disposition of its entire holdings in Dodge at within, as I said three months had a gross profit including dividends that were declared of an excess of $900,000.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="484.082" offset="2010046">Mr. Mulligan, you said that it entered into negotiations with Dodge, let me get the implications of that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.788" offset="2040871">Am I mistaken in my impression that it was Dodge that approached Emerson?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas P. Mulligan</label>
            <text syncTime="497.662" offset="2064381">You are absolutely correct Mr. Justice, and what I meant to say was that negotiations did -- you are forward but you are absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.193" offset="2102415">They were initiated indeed by Reliance on behalf of Dodge and those negotiations did result in this sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.154" offset="2142330">The negotiations however which took place were precisely of a nature which counsel for Emerson had anticipated because in his letter advising Emerson as to this defensive plan, he had contemplated the very things that did happen and suggested that it might be one of the ways of doing it and he issued some precautionary instructions with respect thereto.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.463" offset="2275555">Well, I am sure it was a natural thing for them to want to get rid of it at a profit as soon as they could and that is precisely what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.244" offset="2306693">And it is our position that having undertaken the position of becoming a statutory fiduciary which is what this law does.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.914" offset="2341384">That they were not free to dispose of that stock within the period of six months and keep the profit where they did it pursuant to a plan made at the time when they were an insider.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="625.537" offset="2575859">Well, then it is not drawing up the plan, is it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas P. Mulligan</label>
            <text syncTime="628.217" offset="2586517">It is drawing up in the sense that what they in fact did was precisely what the lawyer had suggested to them in what I would call the defensive plan as an alternative to a proxy contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.365" offset="2647121">And so that when they sold they were in effect carrying out what had been planned as an alternative defensive way of avoiding the impact of Section 16(b) and thus keeping substantially all of the profit on the sale of the Dodge stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.348" offset="2735101">And indeed in the trial in the District Court based upon the evidence that was before him, he made certain findings of fact which are in the record and which are of significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.708" offset="2784525">He found first of all that while it was a beneficial owner, Emerson determined to dispose of its entire holdings so as to avoid Section 16(b) to the extent possible with respect to the profits that would be realized in such disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.106" offset="2862161">He held secondly and this is a very significant one that the first sale which Dodge -- which Emerson made of 37,000 shares to Goldman, Sachs was motivated solely by Emerson’s desire to reduce its holdings under 10% immediately prior to disposing of the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.675" offset="2956410">And finally, he said that his finding was that these two sales were related parts of a single plan of disposition, the substance of which overlooking the form was to dispose of Emerson’s entire holdings and as a consequence he held that the second sale, the 115,282 shares also fell within the act and was not immune from the act by reason of the exemptive provision to which I made reference a moment ago.</text>

            <text syncTime="755.014" offset="3093710">So that Judge Reagan is finding then was directly opposed to advise of counsel both for Reliance and for Emerson or his conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="774.873" offset="3173227">Yes Your Honor, the conclusion which he reached based on these findings which he made was contrary to the opinion of Emerson and it was contrary to a concurrence by Reliance with this exception Your Honor, that in every instance so far as I am aware in which Reliance had concurred in that opinion, it reserved the right to take whatever view was necessary if shareholders raised any question and if any further developments in the law or the facts should dictate otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.948" offset="3337485">And in point of fact, we do have a very significant change in the facts which was not known to Reliance at the time it expressed the views to which you make reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.313" offset="3382938">In that it had no knowledge of the letter of Emerson’s counsel and therefore no knowledge of the plan as I call it of disposition arrived that while Emerson was an insider.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas P. Mulligan</label>
            <text syncTime="862.684" offset="3524417">Yes Your Honor, I am on page 164 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.797" offset="3548868">Judge Reagan in his opinion said looking through form to discern substance, we hold that in truth and in fact, the two sale transactions were related parts of a single plan devised by Emerson to dispose of all of its Dodge Stock and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.746" offset="3620652">Now, when the case got to the Eighth Circuit, an interlocutory appeal by Emerson, the fact is that the Eighth Circuit accepted the findings of the fact by the District Court but held that notwithstanding that acceptance of those facts it was compelled a whole as a matter of law that Section 16(b) did not apply to the second sale because having reduced its holdings to 9.96 it was unfree to do what it wished.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.127" offset="3758161">And in our view what the problem that the Appellate Court had was in feeling that it was obligated to restrict its view of the case to ordinary commercial concepts without a clear and full recognition of the prophylactic effect that this statute was intended to have and without a full appreciation of the liberality of interpretation which was necessary in order to effectuate the purposes of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.241" offset="3878637">It was for that reason that we ask this Court by a way of a petition for certiorari to review the Eighth Circuit’s approval, of a technique which it seems to us permits an insider at a time when he is an insider under the statute to shape his transactions so as to insulate from recovery a substantial portion of the profit which he has realized on profits, on purchases and sales within the six months period.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.442" offset="4087513">Now, the interesting thing in analyzing the Eighth Circuit’s opinion is that it appears that the Eighth Circuit had no difficulty at all in holding that Emerson was liable with respect to its first sale and the clear thrust of the Eighth Circuit’s opinion is that if Emerson had sold the entire 13.2% of its holdings at one time, there could have -- there would have been 16 (b) liability and Reliance would have had a right to recover all of the profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.378" offset="4231186">Difficulty that the Eighth Circuit had was handling the problem of what you do where they divided up to accomplish exactly the same result but in two sales followed in rapid succession.</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert E. Jenner, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2801.069" offset="11277978">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.640" offset="11320296">I am troubled by both arguments because neither argument presents my little case before this Court and all I am seeking is to have the Court decide my case and not decide other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.676" offset="11380378">By a parade of horribles or otherwise, by Mr. Mulligan, a distinguish lawyer from Cleveland seeking to retain for his client, who participated in the purchase of the sales, the profit reselling from their purchase of these -- the stock from Reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.576" offset="11479957">And may I in the few minutes this afternoon, I would like to devote if I may to stating the facts of this case as Mr. Justice Stewart said, the case in 1958 when he wrote the opinion for the unanimous court, that if the trend has come to be as you, Mr. Chief Justice had indicated when you wrote the opinion as the Circuit Justice of the Second Circuit is to examine the facts in each case and decide each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.321" offset="11635019">Now, before I state the facts in this case which were relayed directly Mr. Justice Blackmun to one of the inquires you made as to whether or not in fact Emerson had any inside information of any kind of character at all to which Mr. Mulligan did not give you a correct answer or according to the record in which there is a direct finding in the case in which Dodge brought suit against Emerson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.936" offset="11769393">In which District Judge Grant held in the case that I tried and represented Emerson that Emerson not only had no inside information but no possibility of obtaining inside information.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="2938.507" offset="11827699">For the actual information really is not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.165" offset="11842327">Is it in these cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.605" offset="11856120">They are just statutory presumption of information resulting from the amount of stock that is held, is that not true?</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert E. Jenner, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2953.271" offset="11886735">You are absolutely correct Mr. Chief Justice, but counsel --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="2955.882" offset="11897184">And out of his way, he is saying that he did not imbued any bad faith or bluffing or conspiracy to anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.106" offset="11922157">It was just -- it was taking this in one sense very literal review of the statute and then in another sense perhaps not.</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert E. Jenner, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2972.511" offset="11963744">That is correct Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.274" offset="11974820">But in those who seek to argue the meaning of this and I may say harsh statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.161" offset="12010347">They turn at times to intend when an argument of an intent will favor them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.154" offset="12034275">And they turn to the artificiality of the statute that is a presumed fiduciary relationships because of a holding of a 10% or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.722" offset="12084535">But when that does not suit the attempt to induce a court to interpret this narrow language then they adopt a different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.913" offset="12125390">Now, if Your Honors please, have this in mind overnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.165" offset="12158304">Emerson Electric on the 22 of May 1967 made a tender offer for the purchase of the shares of Dodge Manufacturing Company of Mishawaka, Indiana near South Bend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.078" offset="12222043">Prior to the time that they made that tender offer, they had negotiated with the officers and directors of Dodge Manufacturing Company in the hope that they could arrange a merger with Dodge and Emerson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.152" offset="12294350">Those discussions came of not and when those discussions did end is when Emerson Electric made a tender offer from the shares of Dodge Manufacturing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.372" offset="12351193">The original tender exercise date was June 2, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.807" offset="12384943">As soon as it became known, we announced necessarily on a tender offer you cannot reach shareholders so you publish in newspapers and Wall Street Journals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.445" offset="12427470">When it became known to the Dodge Managers of that company that we had submitted a tender offer for the shares of Dodge at a very substantial increase over the then price, as a matter of fact $20 per share, the Dodge Management immediately contacted all its shareholders immediately and said to them, do not tender your share.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.262" offset="12550768">Two days later, the Dodge Management then entered into a negotiations with Reliance for a defensive merger to defeat the tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.784" offset="12616806">That is to have the shareholders of Dodge approve a merger of Dodge into Reliance and that would destroy the tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.602" offset="12652123">And that was announced to its shareholders immediately and they were urged in favor to consider the defense of merger that was tendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.345" offset="12707085">In addition to that, Dodge filed suit in a Northern District of Indiana before His Honor, Judge Grant, to enjoin Emerson from proceeding with its tender offer claiming that Emerson had obtained confidential information from Dodge during the course of the attempts of Emerson to interest Dodge Management in a merger of Dodge into Emerson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.524" offset="12839787">And it charged in that complaint under Section 10 (b) and Regulation 10 (b) (5) of the Securities and Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.813" offset="12884926">That Emerson had obtained confidential information during the course of the discussions with Dodge Management on the subject matter for possible merger of Dodge into Emerson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.925" offset="12941351">It was in that case that I represented Emerson and tried the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.989" offset="12953681">It was tried before Judge Grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.329" offset="12962980">And after an extend of hearing with a lot of proof taken, Judge Grant held expressly that Emerson had acted in good faith throughout and had never obtained any confidential information of any kind or dirt that what it had obtained by way of information was in 14 case, 10 case, other matters public with the Securities and Exchange Commission once they could examine annual reports and matters of that character.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.167" offset="13098399">And so Judge Grant vacated the temporary restraining order that he had entered against Emerson restraining up from proceeding with this tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.546" offset="13143852">And we extended that tender offer to June 2, 1967 with the approval of Judge Grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.377" offset="13191186">Now, we were faced to that particular time with the defensive merger suggested by Dodge to merge Dodge into Emerson and so at that point, we proposed as a accountable that we would submit to the shareholders of Dodge a proposal for merger of Dodge and Emerson in which we would exchange convertible preferred shares of Emerson for Dodge stock as Reliance has -- was proposing to give to the Dodge shareholders convertible preferred shares for Dodge stock except that we claimed by publication otherwise that our merger offer was more advantageous of the shareholders of Dodge than the Reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.863" offset="13413122">And we made a demand on the Management of Dodge that they submit the Emerson proposed merger to the shareholders of Dodge which the man has run on Directors of Dodge refused to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.147" offset="13486265">Also, we demand that a right to see -- to have a shareholders list so we can communicate with the shareholders of Dodge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.026" offset="13517821">Management refused to give us that list.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.519" offset="13527748">We filed suit in the Superior Court of whatever that county is in Northern Indiana and we -- that is the only way we were able to get a shareholder’s list then we got.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.340" offset="13587098">Then we filed suit when management refused to submit the Emerson merger proposal to the Dodge shareholders and we could not get it to them for a vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.899" offset="13637253">We then decided we would go ahead with the proxy fight to see if we could defeat the merger of Dodge into Emerson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.815" offset="13672988">And Emerson turned or Dodge turned around and sued us to enjoin us as submitting our merger proposal of merger of Dodge into Emerson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.445" offset="13723457">I believe all these with you up to this point to show that it was impossible for anybody to get any confidential information of any kind or character and that Judge Grant held expressly that we had not obtained them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.173" offset="13790435">Now, the proposal for the merger of Dodge into Reliance --</text>
