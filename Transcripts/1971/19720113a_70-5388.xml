            <text syncTime="33.528" offset="207784">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.474" offset="223562">This case involves the constitutional rights of a criminal defendant in circumstances where he has been affected by a collateral use of prior convictions, presumably void under Gideon.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.913" offset="277375">In this case, the collateral use was impeachment of testimonial credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.140" offset="302243">Loper was convicted in November of 1947 in Harris County Texas of the offense of statutory rape of his eight year old stepdaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.304" offset="342890">At his State Court trial, the prosecution's witness, the only one to identify Loper as the violator was Betty Fay Dorothy and she indicated he was guilty, he did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.749" offset="392627">Otis Loper took the stand to testify in his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.647" offset="412271">He denied complicity, denied guilt of the offense and on cross-examination, the State was allowed by the Court to elicit from him details regarding prior convictions that he had suffered in the States of Mississippi and Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.988" offset="481652">There were four prior felony convictions in all and the State brought out the details as to the term of those offenses, where they occurred, that they were all for burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.180" offset="534420">In the District Court the hearing below, evidence was introduced regarding these prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.189" offset="558452">This evidence consisted both of the testimony of Loper as for circumstances surrounding those convictions and also consisted of certified records that have been obtained from the Courts in those proceedings which reflected in most instances that the defendant had appeared in the person or he appeared in his own proper person or otherwise silent regarding the presence or absence of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.839" offset="661061">It is Loper’s contention that the evidence thus introduced, un-contradicted by the State renders those convictions presumably void under the mandate of this Court in Gideon.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.790" offset="800868">Other Courts have indicated in similar circumstances that it seems where the defendant, the one who is convicted introduces testimony to the fact that he did not have counsel, was not represented by a counsel and then he introduces evidence to corroborate that testimony, in this case, certified records of the State Court proceeding, we would contend that those records are sufficient to carry his presumption that he in fact was not represented by a counsel and he had not waived his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.919" offset="929391">And that the Trial Court’s action in disregarding that, the fact that the burden then shifted to the State to prove that he had waived counsel, we believe that cannot be upheld, that is out contention.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.389" offset="1331259">I will proceed to the question of Burgett.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.183" offset="1338364">We have – we had utilized Burgett in the District Court and in the Fifth Circuit without success.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.940" offset="1369397">We had contended throughout that the Burgett rationale applies to Mr. Loper’s circumstances and that the use against him of the prior void convictions to impeach his testimonial credibility was a violation of that rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.433" offset="1439406">Now, the State contends and the Fifth Circuit has held that we go too far, that impeachment, that Burgett itself involved enhancement of punishment and that impeachment of testimonial credibility is not -- it goes only to credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.534" offset="1499801">It is not merely so serious as enhancement which may add years of imprisonment to the sentence of a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.250" offset="1526655">But there are number of factors we have relied upon in asserting that Burgett is not so limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.436" offset="1551419">Most importantly, although Burgett did involve convictions of alleged in recidivist counts, it involved four prior convictions alleged and a Texas indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.359" offset="1603141">The fact of the matter is that Burgett itself involved no enhanced punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.717" offset="1628532">The evidence introduced indicated that the Texas conviction was void on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.248" offset="1650684">It was -- as our (Inaudible) was never introduced, the Tennessee conviction, it was introduced in evidence, was held to be presumptively void.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.427" offset="1687360">The Court withdrew all evidence of those and instructed the jury not to consider the prior convictions for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.535" offset="1723827">The defendant Burgett was convicted and he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, the maximum for the offense involved was 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.812" offset="1760921">So we submit that the constitutional precept that was established was on the facts of Burgett, not one that was limited to a situation where enhancement occurred as the State and the Fifth Circuit would have us believe.</text>

            <text syncTime="458.411" offset="1907311">The point, I would make Your Honor though is it seems to me that in the absence of enhancement, the result in Burgett was that the jury was aware in its deliberations upon the primary substantive issue of guilt of four prior void convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.343" offset="1975020">Now, what difference does it make if that was done under enhancement counts or if it was done to impeach the credibility of a witness who took the stand to testify in his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.683" offset="2020369">If the convictions were void and the jury is made aware of those convictions then rationale applies to permit a conviction obtained in violation of Gideon against Wainwright to be used against a person either to support guilt or enhance punishment for another offense is to erode the principle of that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="594.520" offset="2451703">To proceed with the fact of impeachment, Mr. Chief Justice has raised the point that they were in an enhancement context, but we have tried to pull it out that we have a criminal defender who takes the stand in his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.197" offset="2514501">His credibility is a material factor to his guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.704" offset="2532473">If his credibility is attacked by evidence of prior convictions that are void under Gideon, such that the guilt was not there reliably determined, the argument must be made that any conclusion of untruthfulness by a jury of the impeached witness is equally unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.149" offset="2610318">So it seems to us to follow that the impeachment evidence of that nature tends directly or indirectly to support guilt by causing the jury to disbelieve the testimony of Loper and then proceed along the lines where the prior void conviction is used for that purpose then the defendant clearly under Burgett suffers anew from the deprivation of that Sixth Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.861" offset="2701120">Now we are supported in our conclusion as to the meaning of Burgett by a number of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.480" offset="4087595">What I am suggesting is, is that although Judge Connelly discredited his testimony the rights involved here were spoken about in Burgett in no uncertain terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="1031.334" offset="4198981">The Court might determine that in circumstances where the defendant has suffered this conviction has suffered impeachment or enhancement contrary to the dictates of Burgett and where he introduces in addition to his testimony records that are silent concerning either the existence of counsel being there or any waiver of counsel, if that is sufficient under the circumstances to shift to burden.</text>

            <text syncTime="1090.611" offset="4436068">We would suggest that the Miranda violations there involved in the illegal search and seizure in Walder are different from the Sixth Amendment rights here involved with respect to the prior convictions which are inherently unreliable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1105.831" offset="4496986">In addition the other basis of course is the fact that both of those cases, this is not one where Loper sought to commit perjury or he testified to try to boast his credibility of never having been convicted prior to that time, so that does not furnish a basis that no perjury was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.802" offset="4580891">The State at one point has pointed out that this case should not be reversed for the -- from the standpoint that there was no prosecutorial misconduct involved here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2377.455" offset="9583445">This is the testimony came out and with this along with the fact that he was not be, the jury has now that a prior offense had happened which could justify the 50 years.</text>

            <text syncTime="2454.404" offset="9891272">You have spoken about sending the matter back for re-sentencing which appears to me to be an indication of limiting the concept to Burgett to one which in fact is restricted to the situation of enhanced or increased punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.479" offset="9959608">As I have tried to indicate, I read Burgett more broadly than that and it appears to me that re-sentencing would not be satisfactory in a circumstance where the invalid tainted evidence introduced might have affect to not only the sentencing of Otis Loper, but also his conviction of guilt on the primary offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.923" offset="10049365">It seems to me in that posture that the required relief is not re-sentencing, but avoidance of the conviction and I simply wanted to bring that - -that point forward in case I have not made myself clear.</text>
