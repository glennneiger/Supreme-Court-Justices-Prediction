            <text syncTime="63.440" offset="327423">Mr. Chief Justice Burger and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.878" offset="341216">The Sierra Club brought this proceeding against the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior and their assistants to establish that their plans to authorize a huge private recreational development at Mineral King in Sequoia National Game Refuge and for a State Highway across Sequoia National Park to reach that development are -- were illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.963" offset="433480">The club argued that unless temporarily enjoined, the implementation of those plans, would cause a irreparable harm to the special conversation interests of the club and to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.773" offset="480814">The District Court after two days of hearings granted a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.627" offset="500145">The Government appealed and the Ninth Circuit reversed, denying the Club standing and then finding District Court error in upholding the Club on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.769" offset="540791">The order dissolving the injunction has been stayed pending the outcome of this case and this Court granted the Club's petition for certiorari on February 22, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.796" offset="584886">The case presents several key issues, including first, whether the Sierra Club may have standing for itself and the public to challenge violations of laws which would injure its long held aesthetic and conservational interests in Mineral King and Sequoia National Park.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.419" offset="651342">Second, whether the Secretary of the Interior may permit the State of California to build and operate a new connecting link freeway across Sequoia National Park when it serves no park purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.588" offset="700034">Third, whether Congress has limited the size of long term developments in National Forests, say to 80 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.583" offset="732008">Fourth, whether the Secretary of Agriculture may authorize a huge recreational development in a Game Refuge.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.753" offset="764713">Mineral King is located in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, approximately 225 miles north of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.434" offset="795433">It is a portion of the 15,000 acre Game Refuge which Congress created in 1926.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.210" offset="926463">It is a Game Refuge and it is part of Sequoia National Forest, but it has a special status which we will come to.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.846" offset="1053105">And when you say that it serves no park purpose, do you mean that it is -- its only purpose is to serve the white area which is not part of the park.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leland R. Selna, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="260.327" offset="1114963">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.528" offset="1147773">Walt Disney Productions has described Mineral King and I am quoting from the appendix at page 53A.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.470" offset="1171596">“as unsurpassed in natural splendor, perhaps more similar to the European Alps than any other area in the United States and generously endowed with lakes, streams, cascades, caverns and matchless mountain visitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.746" offset="1224677">In 1969, the forest service accepted a proposal from Disney for a huge Resort Development at Mineral King.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.990" offset="1253621">Disney would construct hotels, lodges, restaurants, other permanent facilities, so the 14,000 persons could ski at Mineral King at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.943" offset="1293431">Some of those permanent features, including ski lifts, parking and sewage disposal facilities and roads, among other things, would not fit on the 80 acres which is the limit of agriculture's term authority under 16 U.S.Code Section 497.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.652" offset="1356230">The District Court found that up to 1,000 acres would be occupied and affected by the development.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.947" offset="1381412">Agriculture plan to get around that limit of 497 by issuing a second interlocking permit relying on 16 U.S. Code, Section 551, which authorizes him to make rules and regulations for the National Forests.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.198" offset="1446509">Now, the road that we spoke off that is in existence is only partially paved.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.634" offset="1464168">It was in existence when the park was created and has served Mineral King for 90 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.527" offset="1487782">To solve the problem of transporting 14,000 persons at one time to Mineral King was the -- was a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.007" offset="1517666">And the State of California agreed to construct a high standard freeway to dead end at Mineral King provided that it could cut across the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.932" offset="1553402">The State rejected other avenues as longer and more costly.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.046" offset="1569807">The Secretary of the Interior finally acquiesced in the highway, although it would not serve a park purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.360" offset="1591123">He also was prepared to issue a permit for a high voltage transmission line across the park to serve Mineral King.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.049" offset="1621843">Sierra Club has worked to preserve the lands of Sequoia National Park and Mineral King since its founding.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.498" offset="1651622">It helped draw the boundary lines and to work out the compromise which established the Game Refuge in 1926.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.293" offset="1678894">As at incident of the club's interest in the area some of these members used Mineral King.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.987" offset="1769591">The public record which is referred to at page 30 of our brief, in footnote 3 refers to testimony in 1920 before the House Committee on Public Lands in which Steven Maker, Director of the park service refers down about halfway in the footnote, “The Sierra Club members probably know that area better than now than any other living people.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.305" offset="1878888">They go there nearly every year, a Club of about 2,000 members and they know every nook and corner of it.”</text>

            <text syncTime="467.688" offset="1944403">Direct testimony concerning their use Mr. Chief --Mr. Justice Blackmun, no there is not.</text>

          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="474.235" stopTime="476.642">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="474.235" offset="1970630">This goes back to the days of John Muir, is it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leland_r_selna_jr" startTime="476.642" stopTime="682.651">
            <label>Mr. Leland R. Selna, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="476.642" offset="1980243">Yes it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.014" offset="2005738">Commencing in 1965, the Club sought public hearings to challenge the project which threatened to seriously impair its conservation program and to harm the public interest in conserving these special lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.573" offset="2051923">But the Secretary of Agriculture refused to conduct those hearings and without them he promised to sue, he promised to issue the two interlocking permits to Disney.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.166" offset="2090375">Those permits were to become effective when the State of California let a contract for highway construction and with those permits Disney would have commence the bulldozing and earth moving which would have cause the re -- irreversible change at Mineral King.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.118" offset="2146173">The Secretary of Interior was about to issue that highway permit which would have triggered the entire project when the Sierra Club filed this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.329" offset="2182953">We first argued that the Sierra Club had standing to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.449" offset="2195492">Our success on this issue though without more would leave unresolved significant National questions of Public Land Management.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.598" offset="2224018">It also would leave intact the Ninth Circuit’s predisposition of the merits in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.339" offset="2243035">We therefore argue that the highway across the park and the Disney Development would be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.948" offset="2265500">We will not argue orally concerning the failure of the Secretary of the Interior to conduct hearings on the park highway concerning the transmission line across the park and concerning the standards applied by the Ninth Circuit in dissolving the preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.841" offset="2320984">These matters have been fully briefed.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.463" offset="2335508">This Court decided in the Data Processing case in 1970 that aggrievement to a aesthetic conversation and recreation was well of economic values could sustain the standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.231" offset="2378558">The Court in that case cited the Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference and Office of Communication of the United Church of Christ cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.698" offset="2412413">Those were cases in which organizations, aesthetic for a conservational or recreational interests were sufficiently aggrieved, to permit them to represent the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.207" offset="2450447">The case is very comparable with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.536" offset="2459851">This Court this year granted the Sierra Club standing in taking jurisdiction of the Citizens to Preserve Overton Park versus Volpe case to enforce the conservational purposes of Federal Highway 8 statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.360" offset="2511155">All of these cases confirm the Sierra Club’s standing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.469" offset="2527560">The Club meets the standing tests of Data Processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.752" offset="2540726">It provides a more than adequate assurance of concrete adversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.035" offset="2557862">The Club would be aggrieved or injured in fact by the threatened acts against its conservational interests in these lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.622" offset="2584194">I have referred to its long-term efforts and it -- to it and it has had a long-term program to preserve these lands for educational programs, writings and advocacy which would have been impaired if the development had occurred – had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.907" offset="2641350">At the same time the development threatened the public's interest in preserving our natural resources for pub -- present and the future generations.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.676" offset="2676354">The club was within the zone of interests of the relevant statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.445" offset="2691400">We will see that 16 U.S. Code, Section 1 protects Sequoia National Park in its present state, in its natural state.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.275" offset="2722747">Section 497 protects the National Forest against to over development.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.024" offset="2741764">Section 688 protects wildlife and its habitat in the game refuge.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.269" offset="2762767">All of these are conservation statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.634" offset="2772171">All of them protect the public interest which is shared by the Club.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.665" offset="2788367">Third, none of these statutes precludes judicial review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1036.002" offset="4217683">Now, because the Sierra Club represents not only itself but the public interests, the Government is wrong in its argument that injury to the public demands a special statutory grant of -- in order to permit standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.629" offset="4280168">But Data Processing case already answered that argument when it recognized that widely held aesthetic conservational and recreational values which by their nature affect the public could be a basis for standing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1083.263" offset="4406705">On the contrary it is because the club represents the public interest that any questions regarding standing should be resolved in its favor because in these cases, conservationist organizations maybe the only people who will step forward to challenge the illegal acts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1444.194" offset="5850440">Concerning Mineral King itself, Agriculture would not have authority to allow it even if it were ordinary National Forest land which it is not. 16 U.S. Code, Section 497 permits the term use of only 80 acres of that land for recreational purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.503" offset="5915642">The Disney Development at Mineral King is so large that it is spills over those 80 acres and its permanent facilities extend beyond them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.426" offset="5947407">The Secretary of Agriculture’s attempt to get around 497 by issuing a second permit for indispensable acreage violates that law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.121" offset="5982202">16 U.S. Code, Section 551 is not authority for the expanded term used.</text>

            <text syncTime="1498.110" offset="6066107">And yet it has been used rather widely, has it not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Leland R. Selna, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1502.128" offset="6082199">Mr. Justice Blackmun, it is been used widely for permits which the Government has represented in every case were terminable at will and those permits had been for structures in many instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.477" offset="6131622">But in every instance the Government has said, we are in a position to take this -- the usual way immediately and restore the public's right in that land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.208" offset="6166522">The fatal difference, the difference here is that the term use is set for 30 years under the 80 acre permit and the other uses are absolutely indispensable to the use that is made on the 80 acres and it results in a tie-in together other uses which is one for a permit for a period of 30 years for acreage exceeding 80.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.389" offset="6271221">The Government correctly argues, Section 497 previously had a five acre limitation and that was amended in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.027" offset="6305807">The Government correctly argues that the motivation of those who wanted to expand five acres to 80 acres was to obtain certainty of tenure and increase financial support for larger developments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.594" offset="6352096">But this explanation is of what happened in 1956 is incomplete because it considers only the goals of those who sought relief from the 5 acre limit while disregarding the reasons for any acreage limitation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.488" offset="6403609">Congress was concerned over the adverse effects of large developments on National Forest Lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.547" offset="6427851">The Forest Service told Congress that 80 acres was necessary in order to include all the facilities in modern developments, including ski lifts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.120" offset="6462124">It calmed Congress' fears by saying that 80 acres was the maximum limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.437" offset="6479469">This is set forth in our reply brief at page 11, footnote 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.457" offset="6503502">Congress did not make the amendment which could have been in order, certainty if tenure had been its only concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.760" offset="6524713">It did not just wipe out the five acre limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.916" offset="6537356">Instead it set up a new limit 80 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.174" offset="6550418">In the entire history of this case no one has explained the purpose of that limitation if not to restrict developments to 80 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.879" offset="6593154">And when he was campaigning for relief from the five-acre limitation, the Secretary Of Agriculture did reveal that he had used combined permits to get around the five-acre limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.729" offset="6632546">He did not say that any of these combined permits exceeded 80-acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.244" offset="6650623">A key to this matter is as if he was not seeking to have Congress ratify his practice of combining permits, rather he was representing that if he could grant permits for up to 80-acres the practice would be discontinued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.488" offset="6711645">The Ninth Circuit erroneously decided that the interlocking supplemental permit to be used in this case need not be terminable at will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.473" offset="6743515">Several Attorneys-General, including Harlan Fiske Stone have said otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.099" offset="6766084">The Government admits at page 48 of its brief, the supplemental permit is essential to the viability of the project, it is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.131" offset="6794192">Revocation would destroy the $35 million Disney investment a major portion of which will be -- within 80 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.756" offset="6824703">The terrific impact on Mineral King of this development would make it impossible to restore it to its natural state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.076" offset="6853960">The supplemental term from -- supplemental permit is not even technically reputable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.793" offset="6872873">Now, the Government has said if the Court finds that all of this is illegal -- it will affect 84 existing ski resorts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.130" offset="6898160">The fact of the matter is it need not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.046" offset="6909862">This is not a consistent administrative practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.632" offset="6920207">Some regional foresters have used the practice and others have rejected it and in any event there is no general department policy or regulation on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.060" offset="6957928">These illegal acts do not legalize Mineral King and they do not require this Court to choose between closing them down and making Mineral King legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.790" offset="6992827">The Court may -- make the operation of its order in this case perspective only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.854" offset="7037131">Now, the Disney Development is illegal as it stands on a National Forest, but it is doubly illegal because it was attempted to be placed on a game refuge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.291" offset="7078822">In 1926 when it created that game refuge, Congress said that its purpose was to protect from trespass, the public lands of the refuge and the game animals that may be on it, which maybe they are on, is the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.258" offset="7142666">The impact of the Disney’s develop -- of the Disney development on the games habitat would be enormous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.972" offset="7161578">California Fishing Game Commission personnel have stated that in an extensive development and I am reading from our appendix at page 30, “that in an extensive development such as the Disney proposal, considerable wildlife habitat would be lost and wildlife would suffer from human encroachment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.466" offset="7227511">The Secretary has made no finding on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.132" offset="7238169">If he had, the finding would have shown that he abused his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.048" offset="7261889">We previously have argued that the refuge is not in Sequoia National Park and that whatever practice there maybe on national parks in regard to ski resorts does not legalize it at Mineral King.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.398" offset="7311312">I will reserve the balance of my time Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1823.711" offset="7368468">It is important I think to get the setting in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.733" offset="7388635">Mineral King is not a wilderness area and has not been for nearly a hundred years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.648" offset="7420295">There was substantial mining activity there back in the 1870’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.112" offset="7442133">Road into Mineral King was built by the County of Tulare in the 1880’s and has been continuously maintained since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.995" offset="7485601">That is the road -- this is the main public highway in the Sequoia Park and this is the road which has existed since the 1880’s for nearly 90 years in the Mineral King.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.915" offset="7537324">In the early 1900’s, a hydro electric facility was built at Mineral King which is still in use there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.984" offset="7569611">There are many cabins, 60 summer homes, two small resorts, a commercial pack station and three public camp grounds located in Mineral King as the record shows at page 80.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.077" offset="7633977">There is indeed a great deal of wilderness area in Sequoia National Park.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.807" offset="7660935">That is well shown by the map which is near the end of the brief filed in this case by Tulare County which is essentially the same area as the map on the board behind me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.549" offset="7731884">But the enormous grey areas on that map are wilderness areas had been so designated by the President and recommended by him to Congress for establishment as wilderness area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.829" offset="7793010">The publicly occupied part of Sequoia Park is entirely to the west, in here where the big trees are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.863" offset="7829164">All of this area over here is wilderness area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1989.019" offset="8029784">Nevertheless, a decision on the merits could be reached only after it was concluded that the petitioner had adequate standing to raise the questions on the merits in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2254.636" offset="9092236">But the Wilderness Society says that the Sierra Club really has more specific grounds of standing and in its reply brief and then the oral argument here, the club now adopts the position of the Wilderness Society, but there are no allegations in the complaint to warrant such a position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.499" offset="9179694">The complaint was based solely on the boldest grounds of standing of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.604" offset="9204040">It is not inappropriate to conclude I think that the Sierra Club took this position for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.003" offset="9237686">And one of first of these reasons is now disclosed in -- on page six of their reply brief where they say, the Government seeks to create a heads I win, tails you lose situation in which either the Courthouse door is barred for lack of assertion of a private unique injury or a preliminary injunction is denied on the ground of the litigant who has advanced private injury, has advanced private injury which does not warrant an injunction adverse to a competing public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.368" offset="9387106">Counsel have shaped their case to avoid this trap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.775" offset="9404765">What they say is that if they had a real plaintiff here, he could not have shown irreparable harm because whatever damage he suffered would be met by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.221" offset="9446561">They could not on that basis have got a preliminary injunction so they had to appear in the most general terms in order to get a preliminary injunction of which they have got.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.322" offset="9490969">And then the second ground of their proceeding is they have I think is in the hope that there would be a decision on the merits and that such a decision would thereby establish the proposition that the Sierra Club and numerous other worthy organizations, old and new have standing to raise in Court any legal question in which they assert an interest and without warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.728" offset="9620537">If such a result is reached, I believe that any individual whether he would be a citizen or alien and in the (Inaudible) case we had a Canadian club of a few hundred members as a party would have standing to raise any question in Court in which he asserts he has an interest without more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.244" offset="9718653">I do not think there is any magic in the fact that the Sierra Club is a club or that has members all along in distinguished history, many of which members may well share the interest which its management now advances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.438" offset="9791378">If it is the fact that it is a group that gives its standing, how big a group must it be, three members or five or fifty or 50,000?</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.791" offset="9848847">What reason is there for picking any number?</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.102" offset="9862117">If any group has standing because it has an intellectual or emotional interest, does it not inevitably follow that any individual who asserts an interest likewise has standing to raise these legal questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.630" offset="9928155">If the Sierra Club has standing as Mr. Justice Blackmun suggested, would not John Muir have standing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2738.919" offset="11029373">But why not?</text>

            <text syncTime="2802.925" offset="11285373">It is a Government of three branches, each of which was intended to have broad and effective powers subject to checks and balances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2818.335" offset="11347022">But the founders also intended that the Congress should have wide powers and that the Executive Branch should have wide powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2832.171" offset="11402401">They are no less sworn than are the members of this Court to uphold the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.899" offset="11437301">This I submit is what really lies behind the standing doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.387" offset="11463214">Embodied in those cryptic words, case and controversy in Article 3 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.796" offset="11496860">Analytically one could have a system of Government in which every legal question arising in the (Inaudible) of Government would be decided by the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.658" offset="11548269">It would not be, I submit a good system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.453" offset="11563524">More important, it is not the system which was ordained and established in our Constitution as it has been understood for nearly 200 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.635" offset="11612217">Over the past 20 or 25 years there has been a great shift of the decision of legal questions in our Governmental operations into the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.895" offset="11661222">This has been the result of continuous whittling away of the numerous doctrines which have been established over the years, designed to minimize the number of Governmental questions which it was the responsibility of the Courts to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.788" offset="11732798">I have already mentioned the most ancient of a case or controversy which was earlier relied on to prevent the presentation of feigned issues to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.190" offset="11786401">But there are many other doctrines which I cannot go into in detail; reviewability, justiciability, sovereign immunity, mootness in various aspects, statutes of limitations and latches, jurisdictional amount, real party and interest and various questions in relation to joinder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.478" offset="11907609">Under all of these headings, limitations which previously existed to minimize the number of questions decided in Courts have broken down in varying degrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.384" offset="11959227">I might also mention the explosive development of class actions which has sown more and more issues into the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.085" offset="11997993">In this connection I would refer to the case of Laird against Tatum in which certiorari was granted yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.620" offset="12028191">Now that -- it was because of the very extreme nature of the position in that case that I thought it worthy of bringing to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.081" offset="12062045">The position there is that the plaintiff can maintain that suit as a class action, although the plaintiffs in that case are not intimidated as is shown by the fact that they bring the suit, but they bring it on behalf of others citizens who might be intimidated if they did not stand up and talk for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.191" offset="12138427">And similarly in the case of Alabama against the Secretary of the Treasury, at the very last minute, a common cause applied to me for a consent to file a brief, amicus curie, I thought it came much too late to grant my consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.316" offset="12222960">I do not know whether the Court adopted their motion or not, but they did file a motion and a brief in which they said that common cause intends to litigate many issues involving fiscal and other matters, and therefore, it is much interested in the questions of standing involved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.188" offset="12318463">If there is standing in this case I find it very difficult to think of any legal issue arising in Government which will not have to await one or more decisions of a Court or the administrator sworn to uphold the law can take any action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.956" offset="12409474">I am not sure that this is good for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.139" offset="12426192">I am not sure if it is good for the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.869" offset="12441134">I do find myself more and more sure that it is not the kind of allocation of Governmental power in our tripartite constitutional system that was contemplated by the founders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.236" offset="12502574">This point is well and briefly covered in the red covered amicus brief filed by the Far West Ski Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.983" offset="12549595">In this case, on page 8 of their brief, they cautioned against the situation where the Government will be deceived in the future by those who would substitute their judgment for the Government’s judgment to the point where it can no longer fulfill its responsibilities to its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.412" offset="12647293">And they add on page 9, administrators must be held to act within the scope of authority provided them, but likewise actions which they take within that scope of authority must not be subjected to protected litigation for the sole purpose of forcing another look at the decision already reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.086" offset="12750006">I do not suggest that the administrators can act at their whim and without any check at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.667" offset="12776338">On the contrary in this area they are subject to continuous check by the Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="3320.551" offset="13355838">You do not have finally to decide them, but my position is that it can be readily found that they are not serious enough so as to warrant the granting of a permanent injunction even though there is some chance that after trial it might be that circumstances could be shown which would lead to the other conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.774" offset="13452804">Mineral King is not a National Forest, excuse me, Mineral King is a national forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.396" offset="13487286">It was excluded from the Sequoia National Park in 1926 because there were mining claims there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.616" offset="13516125">It is perfectly obvious that it is geographically a part of the park area and new mining claims cannot be located in a national park.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.414" offset="13555309">Although it is not a national park it was made a national game refuge and the function of that is that hunting is not allowed in a national game refuge, although it is allowed in a national park.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.407" offset="13623332">There is nothing about making it a national game refuge which means that it must be kept to wilderness or that people may not use the park freely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.213" offset="13662515">As long as it goes to 1949, the Secretary of Agriculture designated the area as a recreation area “hereby set apart and reserved for public recreation use.”A</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.769" offset="13728762">nd in 1960 Congress enacted the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act which provides for recreational use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.650" offset="13764289">There are two statutes, one of which now authorizes term permits for 80 years, the other of which authorizes the term permits for 80 hectares up to 30 years, the other of which authorizes revocable permits without limitation of area, but always revocable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.447" offset="13851433">And the legislative history makes its perfectly plain that when Congress extended the term permit area from five hectares to 80 hectares in 1956 both committees and both Houses of Congress recorded in the committee reports that the Department of Agriculture now has adequate authority to issue revocable permits for all purposes under the Act of June 4, 1897.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.517" offset="13963760">I do not see that there is any basis for saying that there cannot be both term permits and revocable permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.061" offset="13989882">And as the appendix in our brief shows, there are 84 situations where that has been done over a period of many years and both the practical construction and the fact that this has been repeatedly called to the attention of Congress, lead to that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.166" offset="14050382">Now, with respect to the highway through the park that becomes Interior Department rather than Agriculture Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.786" offset="14080788">16 U.S.C. 8 expressly provides that the Secretary of the Interior shall have power “to construct, reconstruct and improve roads in the National Parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.804" offset="14144840">This is either a construction of a new road or a reconstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.811" offset="14168873">It is in part on the same right of way and in part elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.665" offset="14184338">There is nothing in the statute which says that the road must be for park purposes nevertheless, the road does have a legitimate park use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.648" offset="14220282">It will enable people to see areas in the park which would not otherwise be available to them. It will connect with certain areas in the park where there are no camps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.322" offset="14262914">More important I am advised that it will provide markedly improved access for equipment and men engaged in fighting forest fires within the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.429" offset="14307426">Perhaps the superficially most difficult problem in the case is the provision with respect to the electric line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.343" offset="14339087">This is a 66,000 volt transmission line which, however, is to be buried in the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.941" offset="14369389">No powers and no cables and we do have a statute, Section 45 (c) which says that no permit, license, lease and so forth for conduits, reservoirs, dams, power houses, transmission lines or other works for storage or carriage of water shall be granted or made without specific authority from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.040" offset="14465833">And the best statute is read alone, it becomes a very difficult to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.774" offset="14496762">However, the legislative history shows very plainly that this language first appeared in the Federal Power Act and was intended to prevent the federal power commission from granting licenses to build a hydroelectric establishments, dams, Water Park and transmission lines in National Parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.043" offset="14589862">When Sequoia National Park, this was done in 1921, when Sequoia National Park was established in 1926, this same paragraph was taken over verbatim and put into the Sequoia National Park Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.487" offset="14651616">But at that time Congress expressed in the committee report that this was done to prohibit the development of hydroelectric power in the proposed enlarged part, in except by act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.956" offset="14705533">This has nothing to do with the hydroelectric power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.457" offset="14719534">There are other statutes which expressly authorizes the Secretary to grant rights of way for electric poles, plants and lines for the generation and distribution of electrical power and for telephone and telegraph purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.722" offset="14776586">And in the light of all the history, we think it is plain that Congress did not intend to repeal old statute when it could in this provision designed to prevent the establishment of hydro electric establishments in the National Park.</text>

            <text syncTime="3727.544" offset="14983893">There is a provision in the proposed permit Mr. Justice, which says that the road will not be increased in size and that if it turns out to be inadequate that the State will provide other means for getting into the area and it is possible to do so and this I am told is paragraph 37 of the proposed permit on page 76 of our brief as a condition for granting this permit, permitee which is the State of California agrees that should it ever be necessary in the future to provide for increased visitor capacity in Mineral King, an alternate means of access to Mineral King shall be provided which does not involve access through the park or in the alternatives such excess capacity shall be accommodated through mechanical means in lieu of any further improvement of road access and the only thing that I could think of that the mechanical means is would be helicopters or maybe some other kind of airplanes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3826.915" offset="15381373">There is some confusions where which we are to blame about the difference between this appendix in our brief of a proposed permit being different from the one in the Ninth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3900.356" offset="15675093">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.358" offset="15683139">In looking at the merits this Court will find that both the issue of the legality of the highway in the National Park and the legality of the term permits or combining of permits to exceed 80 acres are such that they could indeed and finally decided in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.394" offset="15759208">Turning to the question of standing, it should be clear from our argument that we do not urge that the doors of Courts be opened wide to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.065" offset="15805915">We have argued that there are criteria which should be applied by a Court and by which the organizations or individual’s qualifications for standing should be tested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.330" offset="15850950">The Club in this case did in fact allege its special interest in the area involved and in this area I have noticed pleading, no one in California at the District Court level had any question in their mind as to the deep involvement of the club with Sequoia National Park and Mineral King, so that a case or controversy would be assured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.802" offset="15936840">Now, the Solicitor General has made reference to the reply brief and to our reply brief in dealing with the matter of the club’s use of the area in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.678" offset="15988354">It is true that the Sierra Club for a number of years has run pack trips in Mineral King and it is also true that is specific indicator of its interest in the area was not part of the allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.437" offset="16043420">Those pack trips that are non-profit activity and they are not for any private purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3997.512" offset="16063691">Their purpose is to acquaint people with the national features of the area so that they in turn will be workers that would help to preserve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.588" offset="16104024">Any interference, which the Disney plan would have with those pack trips would not have been of sufficient importance to this club to undertake the litigation that it has ensued here and because of those pack trips, though they are non-profit and though they are in furthering service, interest in the area could have been misunderstood as an economically oriented or other private interest not directly related to the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.511" offset="16219694">They were not alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.567" offset="16231920">Now, concerning whether the Courts will be inundated by the granting of standing in a case such as this, I should only say that the experience which many, many cases we have eluded to has been not to purport -- inundated it all, but that the number of lawsuits brought by environmentalists and conservationists groups has been significantly limited by the practicalities and the realities of carrying out litigation of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.085" offset="16346022">Now, concerning injury, it is true that injury to aesthetic and conservational and recreational values is different in kind than an injury to a voter’s rights or an injury to a tax payer’s rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.813" offset="16408925">It is nevertheless a concrete injury and it should serve everybody strongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4090.646" offset="16436302">As this Court has already noted in the Data Processing case as a basis for statutory agreement, aggrievement under the Administrative Procedure Act as those other types of injury.</text>
