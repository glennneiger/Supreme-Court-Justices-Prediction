            <text syncTime="191.219" offset="838594">Well, they disputed to the extent that with a vale of words, they say that he couldn't get there, I don't think that they dispute that if he were in fact committed as a feeble minded person, that he would be at Muscatatuck.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.576" offset="899930">They also repeat their statement of the Supreme Court of Indiana, a very superficial statement that there is nothing to worry about anyway because as a charge of the department of mental health, he could be transferred to Muscatatuck.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.874" offset="965131">It is our position that there is a great difference and that by the holding of our Court for the first time that Muscatatuck is by definition under our statute a psychiatric institution and therefore, that a transfer could be made from the psychiatric institution at Central State Hospital to Muscatatuck does not answer the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.665" offset="1060322">He is not at Muscatatuck and if he were at Muscatatuck under a transfer, he would still be held by reason of the commitment of the Criminal Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.021" offset="1185709">The fact that they now hold and this was a holding for the first instance, and as far as I know, there never has been such a transfer.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.865" offset="1221131">Now in this case, that the department through the commissioner would have the power to transfer him to Muscatatuck, but that doesn't answer the problem because arriving at Muscatatuck under a transfer does not change the nature of his commitment and he has been committed as a person found to be insane under an Indiana statute designed for the use in instances in which person's insane had been charged with crimes and under the judgment of the Criminal Court of Marion County, he cannot be released until he has recovered his sanity.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.915" offset="1389360">When you use the word insane in the context of that statute, if what it means or I am asking does it mean that he is incompetent to stand trial?</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank E. Spencer</label>
            <text syncTime="340.856" offset="1437112">Well, under the statute and I dispute the position of the Indiana Court in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.272" offset="1474728">The statute speaks in terms of insanity, the determinative principle as to whether or not he will be committed on the one hand or held to trial on the other, and go to trial is the determination of his comprehension or lack of comprehension to understand the nature of the proceedings and to assist his counsel in defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.811" offset="1572949">The State of Indiana, through the Attorney General has taken the position that that is insanity and not only that, but that is the same insanity to use that word as contemplated in the section of the statute in regard to what I referred to as the civil commitment, which requires as a condition precedent that a physician certify that the person for whom application is made is not insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.801" offset="1696873">I don't see any great difficulty involved in differentiating between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.281" offset="1718816">The statute in respect to a person charged with crime contemplates that some persons, not all, who are insane will be found to lack comprehension to understand the nature of the proceedings and to assist in their defense and those persons, not everyone who is insane, but those persons who are found to lack comprehension shall be committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.619" offset="1812126">On the other hand, there is no standard in respect to the civil commitment of a feeble minded person to Muscatatuck, except that which I respectfully submit is now generally considered and denominated a mental illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.976" offset="1885582">The statute --</text>

            <text syncTime="454.394" offset="1891225">There is my second question and then I will let you proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.200" offset="1910451">I have read both briefs and they seem to speak of this feeble minded commitment procedure you have and also the one in the criminal context.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.898" offset="1945246">Does Indiana also have a third procedure for the commitment of the mentally ill?</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>

            <label>Mr. Frank E. Spencer</label>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="476.526" offset="1979832">And this is because it is of no significance here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_e_spencer" startTime="481.603" stopTime="728.997">
            <label>Mr. Frank E. Spencer</label>
            <text syncTime="481.603" offset="2000103">I do not think it is of any significance, except to render questionable or at least indicate question in regard to the state's position that insanity, in the statute for commitment has reference to the same insanity, the same concept of insanity in the provision, in the criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.851" offset="2089128">There is a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.868" offset="2093099">Persons who are insane maybe committed under an entirely separate procedure, persons that we are speaking of are persons who are mentally ill, persons who are committed to Muscatatuck in the school at Fort Wayne are committed because they are feeble minded and that the legislature for a long period of time has determined as a matter of policy that those persons who are mentally ill should not be so committed that they go some place else and therefore, as provided this condition precedent that a physician certify that they are not insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.592" offset="2244087">The provision in regard to the person charged with crime, dealing with persons who are insane is only concerned with the one aspect of mental illness whether or not there is such mental illness there that the effective result is that they lack the comprehension to understand the nature of the proceedings and to assist in their defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.011" offset="2329768">To me, that does not equate the terminology of insanity in the one statute with the terminology of insanity as negative as a condition precedent in the other statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.809" offset="2376893">We are talking about two different things and I think that the existence of the separate procedure for feeble minded persons emphasizes what I am talking about even though both statutes have existed for a long time in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.825" offset="2448991">If it has come up before I am unaware of, this is the first instance that I know of in Indiana where a Muscatatuck feeble minded person has been committed under this statute designed to take care of the person with a mental illness who lacks comprehension to understand the nature of the charges against him and who therefore is committed until he shall become sane, until he shall regain that much comprehension, in spite of his prior existing mental illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.230" offset="2574588">I would like to invite your attention to some statements made by the state of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.668" offset="2604367">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.482" offset="2607607">I'd better go back for just a moment in regard to how this developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.385" offset="2635192">It is very clear in the transcript and I have set out in the Appendix, at the conclusion of the hearing held in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.629" offset="2680227">This contemplates the appointment of two physicians and these two physicians were appointed and tested by Dr. Nai and Dr. Houster (ph) also the superintendent who had worked with this man, who had experience in background at the desk, had worked with this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.541" offset="2743861">He had attempted to communicate and was available to the two physicians who examined him and there is no dispute in the testimony before the Court that this is a condition that will remain, that we're not talking about a mental illness, we're talking about a retardation.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.430" offset="2811362">It is a condition that does exist and has existed, a retardation and the fact that this man is even unable to understand and comprehend the usual sign language of the deaf mutes, just a very, very small amount of that can he even comprehend.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.502" offset="2915642">To emphasize the limitations of this comprehension in his testimony this supervisor informed the Court that the man has no comprehension of time, he has no comprehension of when, he has no comprehension of how, and then as I state the --</text>

            <text syncTime="1961.571" offset="7919972">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court, may I present my associates at the counsel table with me Professor James Weavers of the Indiana University Law School and Assistant Attorney General Robert Colder(ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.906" offset="7977337">May it please the court, based with the dilemma concerning Jackson's condition as described by the petitioner in his argument, just what was Indiana to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.466" offset="8027492">Indiana had three alternatives, Indiana could try Jackson anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.736" offset="8060616">Indiana could discharge him by dismissing the criminal charges against him or Indiana could do what it did and that is commitment to an appropriate psychiatric and rehabilitative institution, until Jackson gained the necessary comprehension to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.853" offset="8149118">In order to make its choice, Indiana looked at the decisions of this Court and found that in Pate versus Robinson, it would have been a Fourteenth Amendment violation to try Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.908" offset="8201259">It was conceded by the state in that court in that decision, that the defendant in that case -- it would have been a Fourteenth Amendment violation to try him, but the court went on to say in its opinion that it was error and an Fourteenth Amendment violation for the court not to give the defendant in that case a competency hearing on its own motion, even where it was not specifically requested by counsel in Pate versus Robinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.683" offset="8336364">So the Fourteenth Amendment precluded Indiana from trying Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.447" offset="8359456">The second alternative that Jackson be released on a dismissal of the criminal charges was not appealing or appropriate to Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.409" offset="8399267">It was not constitutionally required respondent submits, certainly not by the equal protection arguments and the cruel and unusual punishment arguments that petitioner makes to this Court by his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.201" offset="8462483">And it would have been that the peace in dignity of Indiana was offended by the commission of the two robberies, which Jackson was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.222" offset="8494562">To release him and discharge him would have further offended the state and would have offended Mrs. Farley and Mrs. Lions.</text>
