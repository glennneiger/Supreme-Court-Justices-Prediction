            <text syncTime="14.746" offset="132659">This case brings up for consideration a judgment rendered in the Ohio State Court on a promissory note which contained a provision for confession of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.535" offset="211863">This is the note, commonly known as cognovit note by which the maker of the note agrees that if there is any default in payment of an installment or in the principal of the note, that he appoints any attorney in the state to enter an appearance, waive notice and service of process and confess judgment for the amount demanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.290" offset="358880">Appointment of this attorney has been made by the holder of the note, the adverse body to the maker of the note.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.814" offset="392943">In the case that borrower, it appears that the party have a contract whereby the respondent, holder of the note, wants to install a cold storage, a refrigerating plant in very large warehouse and the original contract was for some $230,000.00 for $223,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.180" offset="502344">The payment of $94,000.00 was made and a note in the amount of $130,000.00 was executed to cover the balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.670" offset="552395">This was to be paid in monthly payments of some 16 months and it contained this provision that we are considering here, the cognovit provision, that is any attorney might be designated by the holder of the note to enter an appearance and confess judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="155.464" offset="695546">That would be correct, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.497" offset="711637">Now after the installation was completed, the equipment was put in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.669" offset="756359">It was to be automatically controlled to produce a temperature or 10 degrees below zero and it functioned for a little while and then died of heart failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.187" offset="814455">The warehouse company lost some ice cream and very nearly lost a large quantity of turkeys, but they were salvaged and they called on the supplier to remedy the defect and they tried, it was unsuccessful and they had to maintain a staff of people to watch the machinery and keep it going and keep it controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.789" offset="912780">And so the purchaser notified them that he would not make payment unless they could put in good order and refused to go forward with the scheduled payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.831" offset="960950">And when that happened, they proceeded to take judgment, the attorney who confessed judgment for the defendant, the petitioner here, was completely unknown to the defendant, never communicated with the defendant, was obviously selected by the holder of the note and paid by the holder of the note and he simply entered an appearance and confessed judgment waiving notice and service.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.091" offset="1074008">Then under Ohio procedure, notice was given, that there is a judgment against you and the defendant engaged counsel in an attempt to set it aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.762" offset="1116744">They filed a motion for new trial, filed a motion to stay execution and a motion to vacate the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.340" offset="1147046">Setting forth that it was ended without notice and that they wanted a trial and tendered as sworn answer showing the difficulties with the equipment and the problems that had risen and also attached a course action which alleged to claims in excess of the amount demanded on the note as damages due to the malfunctioning of the equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.765" offset="1260731">The trial court declined to entertain the course action and simply affirmed the judgment and refused to --</text>

            <text syncTime="313.823" offset="1328963">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.736" offset="1332620">No witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.684" offset="1336382">No, nothing of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.755" offset="1352682">Thereafter, an appeal was taken to Court of Appeals and the constitutional question was set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.810" offset="1380894">The Court of Appeals simply said, this is a matter of discretion and it would not be offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.465" offset="1403569">They then asked the Ohio Supreme Court to review the matter on constitutional grounds, Federal and State and the Ohio Supreme Court on its own motion dismissed the appeal saying that there is no constitutional question involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.558" offset="1475876">We then filed this petition for certiorari and the Court granted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.568" offset="1495938">Now, we say there are three objections here really.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.200" offset="1510462">First and foremost and most important is the question of in personam jurisdiction and I have to dredge up from our law school days the case of Pennoyer against Neff in which this Court very clearly set forth the rule that unless there is jurisdiction in personam there can be no judgment in personam and there certainly was no jurisdiction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.745" offset="1604607">In the first place, it has established that in personam of jurisdiction was rest upon service of process within the jurisdiction or a voluntary appearance and submission to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.479" offset="1651627">Now, there is no argument that service was made in this case because it was expressly waived, but they rest the entire judgment on appearance by this attorney who was unknown to the defendant, who was selected by the advisory and paid by him for the sole and only purpose of coming into Court and confessing judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.059" offset="1741907">It might be different, if he communicated with the defendant and said if you got any defense, you got any case, the right thing you want me to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.666" offset="1768343">He did not do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.878" offset="1773149">He just confessed the judgment and that was all.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.854" offset="1785061">Now, we take it as a fundamental that a lawyer who owes an obligation to a client to represent his interests, that he cannot go in there and throw his client into the hands of the other side without even communicating.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.783" offset="1840858">For example, I can conceive of a situation where there is note and I am not saying that happens in this case, the note might be signed by somebody other than the person whose name is on there or it might have been signed under circumstances that he might validly object to.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.427" offset="1915360">For example, there might some misrepresentation of fraud in the inducement and inducing him to sign.</text>

            <text syncTime="466.278" offset="1938765">That would be subject to collateral attack, would it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="469.540" offset="1951827">It possibly would, Your Honor, but in Ohio you have a judgment against you.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.292" offset="1978889">You have lien on all the real estate and in Ohio, the statute and the case law and we noted it in our brief here and the statute is set forth, the burden of proof is on the person who moves to set it aside, that is upon the defendant and he must show that he has a valid defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.418" offset="2063317">That is what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.380" offset="2071154">In other words, there is a shifting of the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant to overcome this, whereas as a matter of fact, if the case were tried in good order and in accordance with usual standards, the burden of proof would rest upon the plaintiff to make out his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.614" offset="2144088">In this kind of situation he might not be able to make out a case, but for the promissory note with the cognovit provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.533" offset="2179823">At any rate it is clear, that this confession or this appearance by this attorney should not be permitted to stand and we have referred in the brief to Canon 6 of the American Bar Association which we have set out verbatim and which says, in so many words that an attorney owes the kind of obligation to his client to disclose any conflict of interest, to disclose any possible basis upon which the client might object to his representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.216" offset="2350560">He owes single-minded loyalty to his client and the Canon even says that it is unprofessional for an attorney to accept an obligation where he may be obligated to carry water on both shoulders.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.368" offset="2419105">It is his duty to contend for that, it is his duty to contend for that which duty to another client requires him to oppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.096" offset="2462050">Clearly that happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.196" offset="2470409">The lawyer who was engaged by the plaintiff below, the respondent here has only an obligation to the advisory of his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.125" offset="2514191">And he goes into Court only for the purpose of throwing his client to the wolves, not for the purpose of representing him, but for the purpose of betraying him.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.388" offset="2555255">Now, that is strong language, but that is the obvious and inevitable construction that must be placed upon his undertaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.885" offset="2585244">He goes in there only to confess judgment against his client and I cannot get by the fact that he does so without ever talking to his client.</text>

            <text syncTime="789.284" offset="3230782">At any rate, it is our conclusion that because there was no service of process and there was no voluntary appearance by an attorney in the sense in which we members of the bar would like to look upon attorneys as obligated to represent a client truthfully and honorably and fairly, there was no jurisdiction in personam within the meaning of decisions cited in our brief by this Court holding that such jurisdiction in personam is a vital prerequisite to a judgment in personam.</text>

            <text syncTime="1117.500" offset="4543696">He would certainly disown the lawyer selected by the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.564" offset="4563967">We have set forth in the brief, cases in which this has happened in the other Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.138" offset="4586223">Fortunately, I must confess, very extensive research has not disclosed the great volume of case law in the subject because lawyers are generally very careful not to appear in a case where there is a conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.986" offset="4649649">All of our training is to be faithful and the loyal to one client to look out to his interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.139" offset="4678279">And in the Glasser case which we have cited in the brief, this Court invalidated the conviction because counsel for the petitioner who is one of several defendants also represented other defendants in the case below where there was a possibility of conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.298" offset="4746824">They were on the same side, but there was a possibility of conflict in the Court, in very clear language announced the doctrine that there must be no conflict of interest in a lawyer’s undertaking when he appears in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.077" offset="4805965">Now that Glasser case is typical of many that we have cited and we have discussed at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.621" offset="4832192">The cases were, for example, in the Indiana Court a proceeding was brought against a non-resident and appearance was entered by a non-resident employee of the defendant who sent an answer to counsel for the plaintiff in the Indiana and they entered a confession of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.954" offset="4921531">Indiana Court threw it out saying, public policy prohibits this, a matter of serious public policy prohibits a party from representing both sides in the litigation and the defendant in the case cannot be represented by counsel for the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.202" offset="4998436">Now, that is exactly what happens in the case at Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.016" offset="5013691">There is one more point I would like to touch upon briefly and that is the waiver point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.638" offset="5036261">The other side says, well, he waived his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.643" offset="5052248">It does not seems sensible to say, that when you sign a contract, you equate even the right the performance of the contract and that is what this argument goes to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.520" offset="5091745">In other words, you may waive rights when you know what those rights are.</text>

            <text syncTime="1516.715" offset="6140509">The facts in the record in this case conclusively refute each of the constitutional contentions which have just been advanced and by that, I refer to both the facts as to what happened between Frick and Overmyer over a period of several years prior to Overmyer’s default on the second installment note and the facts as to what subsequently occurred, first in the District Court in New York and what occurred in the State Courts in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.779" offset="6308842">Now, I think I should start, just by making reference to what actually happened in the Federal District Court in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.791" offset="6340816">The opinion of Judge Mansfield is set forth in full in the appendix at page 81.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.650" offset="6376238">I think that is instructive reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.033" offset="6389822">It is true that no witnesses appeared in the New York proceeding, but that is because Overmyer chose to present no witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.709" offset="6436529">At page 81 through 83 in the record, Overmyer presented no witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.046" offset="6473831">The matter is gone into preceding the opinion in the affidavits of New York counsel who handled the matter, which established in Judge Mansfield’s opinion that there was no merit to Overmyer’s position.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gregory M. Harvey</label>
            <text syncTime="1680.966" offset="6797541">I believe it was dismissed by agreement as to moot or dismissed by Overmyer as a matter of fact voluntarily, I am informed by my associate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.772" offset="6840800">I think we have to start chronologically from the beginning to establish briefly just what occurred prior to the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.235" offset="6870579">It is very important to the case, both on the constitutional issues and because what happened between Frick and Overmyer was the basis for the Ohio Court’s decisions that Overmyer had no valid defense to the note, although it might well have a counter claim for breach of warranty to be asserted separately against Frick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.784" offset="6964829">Now, the first contract relevant to the case was the original construction subcontract which has been described for the installation of refrigeration machinery in a warehouse under construction in Toledo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.504" offset="7039644">The record before you, printed in the appendix, establishes that Overmyer consistently failed to make the progress payments which were required under that constructions subcontract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.253" offset="7094710">And Frick accordingly, after numerous demands for payment which were again printed in the appendix, Frick accordingly, stop to work and as to what is right under Ohio law recorded mechanic’s liens against the property in a total amount of 194,000 and some odd dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.938" offset="7185407">Those liens have never been challenged at any stage in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.742" offset="7212679">Three months later, Frick, the respondent here agreed to an Overmyer proposal for extended terms of payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.524" offset="7255729">Frick agreed to take 10% of the balance then due and owing in cash and the remainder in 12 monthly installments with interest at 6-1/2%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.895" offset="7305257">The effect of that was that instead of being paid in full in October 1966, as required by the original contract, Frick agreed to receive the final payment in February of 1968 and Overmyer accordingly executed the first installment note which is in the record at page 51, which contains no confession of judgment clause and which in language which appears in the middle of appendix page 52, expressly preserves Frick’s mechanic’s liens against the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.071" offset="7485920">Frick agreed to forgo their enforcement so long is there is no default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.077" offset="7517998">Immediately after delivery by Overmyer to Frick of this first installment note, Frick completed the work, placed the system in operation, conducted a demonstration of the system and formally requested of Overmyer that it accepted the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.898" offset="7593231">Overmyer did accept the system and the acceptance documents are also printed in the record at page 54.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.537" offset="7639833">Now, under the subcontract and the subcontract is in the record, although not printed in the appendix, but under the subcontract, if Overmyer had been dissatisfied with the system, Overmyer was required to give written notice of the alleged deficiencies and Frick was required under the subcontract to correct those deficiencies to Overmyer’s satisfaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.917" offset="7749338">I think this is very important because the original construction subcontract reserved to Overmyer’s engineer the final determination of whether the work done was in accordance with the specifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.192" offset="7818406">On the other hand, however, the effect of Overmyer’s written acceptance which you see in the record at page 54 was to waive all claims except those which might be made under the continuing warranty provisions of the contract which are also in the appendix and Overmyer’s failure to specify in writing any deficiencies of course would have the same effect under the contract, but Overmyer did formally accept the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.385" offset="7959258">Now, the next development in the relations between the two sides --</text>

            <text syncTime="2004.634" offset="8092169">Overmyer desired to have the liens released, that is my point in the record at several points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.280" offset="8126756">Why they so desired is not clear, but it was apparently an urgent desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.399" offset="8147236">I comment first on reasons for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.635" offset="8160192">There were negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.339" offset="8166984">There were exchanges of correspondence between general counsel for Overmyer and the counsel for Frick.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.137" offset="8194256">Negotiations were conducted largely through lawyers on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.722" offset="8220587">The result of those negotiations was the execution of the second installment note, which did three things very favorable to Overmyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.340" offset="8263010">First, it extended the term time of payment for 21 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.411" offset="8283281">So instead of getting the money in full in October 1966, which had then been extended to February 1968, Frick now agreed to wait till February of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.763" offset="8332705">Second, the rate of interest was reduced by half point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.860" offset="8349110">Third, Frick agreed in the second note to release and Frick actually did release the three mechanic’s liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.138" offset="8382233">I think that the text of the note is instructive in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.018" offset="8393727">It appears at page 6 and 7 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.052" offset="8409923">You will see on page 7 of the appendix that the two provisions follow immediately upon them and there is in the record, the affidavit of the Frick person responsible for the work to the effect, but in Frick’s mind the two were linked, that appears in the middle of page 32, Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.778" offset="8540744">In other words that Frick was willing to extend the time of payment so long as it could obtain security and the security which Frick desired was either the mechanic’s liens which it thought were adequate security or a bundle of other rights, including first the confession of judgment clause, second mortgages and I think that is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.539" offset="8679820">That was the additional security, but it is clear from the record and another point, Mr. Justice Brennan also, I refer to Frick’s letter of October 10 reproduced in the record at page 49, the second numbered paragraph of that letter says, “In lieu of actual cash, Frick has indicated their willingness to accept $35,000.00,” I am just giving you the high points, “provided the balance can be evidenced by interest-bearing judgment note.”</text>
