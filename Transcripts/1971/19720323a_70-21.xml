            <text syncTime="42.456" offset="243530">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.610" offset="256173">This case involves the constitutionality of Ohio Revised Code Section 3517.07 which imposes political tests on access to the ballot in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.636" offset="312180">The statute is set out in the appendix in pages 12 through 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.714" offset="332555">But it precludes from the ballot in Ohio Elections, and if I may quote briefly from the statute, “Any political party or group which advocates, either directly or indirectly, the overthrow, by force or violence, of our local state or national government or which carries on a program of sedition or treason by radio, speech or press or which has in any manner, any connection with any foreign government or power or which in manner has any connection with any group or organization so connected or so advocating the overthrow by force or violence of these various governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.362" offset="487096">Exempted from this requirement of the statute, that the party to get on the ballot actually meet these tests, are parties and groups that have a place on the ballot in each national and gubernatorial election in Ohio since 1900.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.209" offset="562537">Those two parties -- there are only two parties that meet that tests. Of course, those are the Democratic and Republican parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.038" offset="585838">Under the statute to secure a ballot position --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="131.015" offset="597750">You certainly are not suggesting that in the absence of the exception, they couldn’t get on the ballot of this?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="137.217" stopTime="375.302">
            <label>Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen</label>
            <text syncTime="137.217" offset="622514">Of course not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.760" offset="628679">I am implying an argument that I’ll get to some what later which is an equal protection argument that by exempting any parties from this requirement, the State is drawing invidious classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.553" offset="683850">And I will come to that argument if I may, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.780" offset="696807">But under the statute, parties that do have to meet this test in fact have to submit an affidavit signed by 10 members of the party or group, three of whom are to be executive officers of the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.138" offset="754276">After the affidavit in the form of the statute is executed and filed to the Secretary of State.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.305" offset="774861">The Secretary of State is required to conduct his own investigation of the facts appearing on the affidavit and to make his own determination of whether the party or group should be on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.391" offset="823239">Now the plaintiffs brought suit in 1970, challenging this provision as well as any number of other Ohio provisions, but those provisions which were in the litigation have all been washout of this suit by subsequent action of the legislature of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.987" offset="897636">We sought an injunctive and declaratory relief from a prejudge statutory Court and on May 5, 1970, the District Court declared the provision, the statute of Ohio unconstitutional on its face, but reading the controlling and only decision of the Ohio Supreme Court on the statute, the State ex rel. Beck v. Hummel case, excuse me, to narrow the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.650" offset="1008291">The Court upheld the statute as construed and thus the Court held that the statute now means and this is quote in the appendix of page 62, that an oath is required that; one, the party is not engaged in an attempt to overthrow the Government by force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.640" offset="1084255">Two, the party does not carry on a program of sedition or treason as defined by criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.487" offset="1107661">And three, the party is not knowingly associated with a group attempting to overthrow the Government by force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.877" offset="1137231">Plaintiffs appealed from the denial of their injunction upholding the statute is construed, defendants have cross appealed from so much of the decision of the three-judge District Court holding the statute unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.931" offset="1201388">Plaintiffs request this Court to reverse and remand with directions to the District Court to declare entire statute unconstitutional and to enjoin its enforcement in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.983" offset="1249662">There are several reasons why the statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.188" offset="1266485">Some of these reasons go to the statute on its face, some go to the statute as construed and interpreted by the District Court with the assistance in Ohio Supreme Court and some relate to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.866" offset="1329179">It’s the position of plaintiffs that the starting point for analysis of this statute is an appreciation of the importance of the right to vote and to gain access to the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.713" offset="1384558">This Court in numerous decisions over the last decades has held for example as in Wesberry versus Sanders, that no right is more precious in a free country than not of having a voice in the election of those who make the laws unto which its good citizens we must live.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.496" offset="1451641">Other rights even the most basic are elusory if the right to vote is undermined.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.950" offset="1473479">It is our first position in this case, Your Honors that there is an absolute right on the part of the electorate to vote for candidates for public office without the State interposing any kind of a screen between that right to vote and access to the ballot.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen</label>
            <text syncTime="395.254" offset="1654665">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.946" offset="1657486">And this is the only provision that appears to remain.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.698" offset="1672428">Okay, we think that there is a very substantial, first amendment component to the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.158" offset="1710358">We believe that this Court has recognized that substantial First Amendment component.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.903" offset="1729270">In the predecessor to this case, Williams versus Rhodes for example, the decision by Justice Black on equal protection grounds started of from an appreciation of the fact the right of individuals to associate for advancement of political beliefs and the right of qualified voters regardless of their political persuasion to cast there votes effectively is a fundamental right and was the issue involved in that particular case and indeed remains the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.614" offset="1856121">For our first position on this law is that Ohio has no right to interpose any kind of a political test for the vote itself and for access to the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.435" offset="1915471">The question of what Ohio may do in terms of qualifying elected officials when it comes time for them to take their oath of office is not a question before this Court, we don’t even act that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.463" offset="1971582">So we would submit that not even the oath of office contemplated in Article 6 of the Constitution in the United States is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.920" offset="2005332">Now, on the other hand, should the Court be reticent about taking this particular step in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.445" offset="2043471">Our second position is, that Article 6 of the Constitution which provides for a constitutional oath of office for elected officials in the United States read together with Amendment Number 1 has to mean that at most in terms of political credentials, speech and association credentials of candidates for public office, parties on about, all that can be required is a test basically in the form of in Article 6 affidavit or oath of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.941" offset="2181398">We believe that this, although is not the holding of the Court in the case of Bond versus Floyd involving access to the legislature in the State of Georgia and it is not of course the holding of the case in this Court’s decisions in Powell versus McCormack involving the Court’s ability to review a determination by the Congress that a member should be refused his sit and holding that the house is limited in its consideration only to those constitutional requisites which the member must meet and which are set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.667" offset="2336356">These two decisions do imply very strongly at the most that the State may require the Article 6 kind of test.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.666" offset="2372301">We would refer the Court as well to a number of state court decisions, the leading one of which -- although dealing with state constitutional law is Imbrie versus Marsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.675" offset="2416395">It is not cited in brief unfortunately, it is a decision of Chief Justice Vanderbilt of the New Jersey Supreme Court and its reference is 71 Atlantic second 352, three New Jersey 578, in which Chief Justice Vanderbilt faced with a State law of New Jersey which added to the qualifications for ballot access and for office as an elected official, things that were not contemplated in the constitutional oath provided under federal and state constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.277" offset="2570831">The Court ruled quite clearly that the constitutional oath requirement brooked no additions, whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.746" offset="2608656">On this point, the Court might also refer to Shub v. Simpson which is cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.557" offset="2627883">The Maryland Court of Appeals decision, although it disavowed the Imbrie case so far as state offices are concerned, it clearly accepted the Imbrie rationale on a preemption basis so far as federal elected officers are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.773" offset="2704787">Now, in addition to our first two points, we have a number which are perhaps more fully briefed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.013" offset="2745747">The third point on constitutionality of this Ohio provision pertains to the statutes invasion of the right to political association.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.708" offset="2788483">The statute does not even screen candidates as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.299" offset="2806874">It is not a requirement that a candidate execute an oath which was precisely the question before this Court in the Guinn case of which the District Court below made much.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.129" offset="2858178">That’s not the case, the question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.046" offset="2873852">What we have here is a statute which presumes to screen political congeries, associations, groups and parties and to keep them off of the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.862" offset="2917110">We will submit the cases like Gibson v. Florida Legislative Investigation Committee and NAACP v. Alabama would suggest that such a statute is at least constitutionally presumptively unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.814" offset="2980954">In addition, since the statute requires that 10 members of the party whether candidates or not, only three of whom are to the offices of the party must execute the affidavit, there is a direct invasion of the associational rights of those individuals as indicated in the Shelton and Bates decisions and the decisions involving the Subversive Activities Control Act and the registration requirements for communist action organizations, Albertson v. CP and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.804" offset="3132882">This statute in addition is unconstitutionally overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.835" offset="3157019">It is perfectly clear the statute on its face if all the Court had before was the statutory language is unconstitutionally broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.821" offset="3196934">With fully briefed that point and I won’t go over the statute on its face in terms of the overbreadth.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.452" offset="3227445">The State does suggest that the statute is still constitutional on its face, but the District Court below certainly held to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.955" offset="3257538">We submit that even as construed by the Supreme Court of Ohio in the Beck case, the statute is unconstitutionally broad and indeed the District Court below misread the Supreme Court of Ohio’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.726" offset="3324621">It is our position that the Supreme Court of Ohio in narrowing the statute only narrowed it to the point of drawing a distinction between violence or engaging in violence, but including in that category mere advocacy of violence or violent overthrow, and on the other hand, peaceable change as through use of the amendment process.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.273" offset="3426812">A careful reading of the decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio, I think, will make that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.534" offset="3447814">In addition, I think that although there are no other Ohio Supreme Court decisions on point, there are a number of Ohio lower court decisions dealing with analogous statutes which seemed to indicate as well that their understanding of the law in Ohio was -- that the distinction being drawn is between violence including mere advocacy and peaceable change.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.269" offset="3534750">Even as construed as interpreted by the District Court below, however, the statue remains unconstitutionally broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.927" offset="3573411">Again, to a large extent, this point has taken up in our argument I just mentioned the two most notable aspects of the overbreadth statute as construed by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.913" offset="3629313">Fourth, the District Court in its narrowing construction of statutes speaks of the party knowingly associated or associating with a group attempting to overthrow Government by force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.208" offset="3710501">We submit that the use of the term knowingly associated is two-open ended even though this term itself two-open ended, in addition, we submit that this criterion established by the District Court does not take account of numerous decisions of this Court which hold that mere knowing association membership in or participation in a group which is engaged in or advocating violent overthrow is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.267" offset="3834740">There must be specific intent on the part of the person or in this case party associating to further or fulfill the unlawful goals of the organization which is engaged in the unlawful act or advocacy.</text>

            <text syncTime="956.105" offset="3898061">Not when I gather Mr. Rosen, you don’t extend your overbreadth argument to either elements one or two of the District Court’s construction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen</label>
            <text syncTime="968.839" offset="3949052">We don’t extend the overbreadth argument to such.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.615" offset="3960127">I do extend the next point which of course is a vagueness point to points one and two.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.832" offset="3988967">I must say to the extent that I understand what number one means, the party is not engaged in an attempt to overthrow the Government by force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.409" offset="4027314">It would be difficult for us to argue that that is overbroad, assuming that this inquiry can be made or this investigation can be made and we do not conceive that.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.610" offset="4068170">It seems a silly thing to ask somebody to make an affidavit about since it is speaking of the immediate present and this instant and has no reference to future behavior activity, but I suppose we couldn’t say it is overbroad if anything, it is incredibly narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.545" offset="4135879">However, we do think that there may be some vagaries involved in that particular language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.800" offset="4180914">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.082" offset="4193976">Less in a point one, except this red with the statute itself than in the point two, the party does not carry on a program of sedition or treason as defined by the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.083" offset="4246012">Well, I supposed we know what treason means under the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.655" offset="4272343">I assume, and I think the Court would assume that treason would be limited by Article 3 of the Constitution to mean making war on the United States or any of them or adhering to their enemies proven according to the two-witness rule or open confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.304" offset="4346949">And indeed, I believe there is an Ohio statute on treason though I don’t know that it has ever been enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.701" offset="4372444">However, there is no sedition law in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.429" offset="4387386">The closes thing to a sedition law in Ohio was the Criminal Syndicalism Act which this Court declared was unconstitutional in Brandenburg versus Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.946" offset="4429496">There is no referent in Ohio jurisprudence at all for meaning for the term sedition and of course this Court has recognized – I’ve had the reference to your language Mr. Justice Brennan on the difficulty the Court has with you, so those two words, sedition and treason and the difficulty of the defining them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.159" offset="4522283">But that is quoted in the brief and we would rest on that proposition so far as the construction by the District Court is concerned, these are the primary vague provisions in this newly construed statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.709" offset="4584558">But again, we do not agree that the District Court was correct in its construction in light of the Supreme Court of Ohio’s view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.306" offset="4610890">We think it’s perfectly clear further that the vagueness that’s found on the statute and the overbreadth is incredibly magnified by the deprivations of due process of law in a procedural sense that are found in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.458" offset="4675465">First is a burden of going forward which is placed immediately upon the party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.129" offset="4698243">The statute requires that an affidavit be submitted on behalf of the political party or group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.483" offset="4727605">It seems to us that that kind of a requirement is interdicted by this Court’s decision in Speiser versus Randall, once you’re in the First Amendment area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.436" offset="4763445">Further, the affidavit isn’t enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.146" offset="4774312">It is not even presumptively dispositive of the facts of not being subversive or not fitting within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.066" offset="4805972">The statute provides that the Secretary of State shall undertake an independent investigation, and the evidence of the kind of an investigation the Secretary of State is likely to conduct is presented in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Ohio in the Beck v. Hummel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.302" offset="4874936">It was cursory and anti First Amendment at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.210" offset="4890505">And so the Supreme Court of Ohio itself found in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.904" offset="4913283">In the course of the investigation, the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled that the Secretary of State need, provide no hearing, none whatsoever, he can do his own ex parte investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.333" offset="4975037">Clear offense to procedural due process and further, the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled that once he made his findings and certified that the party or group should not have access to the ballot, it should not be placed upon the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.956" offset="5041492">The Supreme Court ruled they would review, they and the other Ohio courts review according to a test of substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.195" offset="5078482">Whether there is substantial evidence, I assume the Court meant on the record as a whole to support the decision of the Secretary of State, although the test may not be even as generous to the party or group as a substantial evidence rule because the Court also speaks about reviewing according to a determination whether will overrule the Secretary of State, only if his finding is manifestly against the weight of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.779" offset="5192794">Much too stringent and evidentiary test onto this Court’s decisions in Speiser versus Randall, Kernel versus Hagen Buffin, and Law Students Association versus Wadmond, so again, another constitutional infirmity in the scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.278" offset="5254756">And finally, to return to the point that Justice Stewart brought out in his question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.369" offset="5287148">We think all of these defects are further magnified by the fact that there is an exemption for parties with a great deal of continuous longevity on the ballot in the State of Ohio, those two parties of course being the democrats and Republicans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.133" offset="5350260">We do not imply at this time that either of those parties would have difficulty securing the ballot position under the test of this statute even as construed assumingly quite understand what they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.153" offset="5398325">What we do mean to imply is your observation Justice Stewart in Jenness versus Fortson where you said time after time, established political parties at local state and national levels has while maintaining their old labels, change the ideological direction because of influence and leadership of those with unorthodox or “radical” views.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.728" offset="5500621">The history of this United States is replete with examples of changes of ideological direction on the part of political parties in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.777" offset="5540745">I just reviewed a document that had been prepared by the former Secretary of State of Ohio on the election experience in Ohio over a long period of time from the beginning of the republic to the present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.475" offset="5591631">I counted 37 separate political parties of whom I know at least 10 engaged in one type of metamorphosis or another of which several were more or less revolutionary for their time including the evolutionist part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.732" offset="5648578">Presumably that party might not be able to secure ballot position in Ohio today if it attempted to go on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.895" offset="5677313">On the basis of this various defects, it is the appellants’ position that the decision of the Court below should be reversed, the case remanded and with instructions to enjoin the operation of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.384" offset="5739171">I would like to reserve for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.986" offset="5745649">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1429.984" offset="5793610">I would like to answer the first objection which has been raised which is a question of the violation of due process, procedural due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.225" offset="5858603">I think if the Court will examine the Ohio case of Beck versus Hummel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.328" offset="5887024">They will find out that the Ohio Court and the Ohio law does not run a fall of the previous decisions of this Court such as Speiser for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.711" offset="5952539">The Secretary of the State of Ohio makes a determination on the basis of the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.821" offset="5980960">It is true that that is a unilateral determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.676" offset="6000395">The next step is he then refuses to certify and put the party on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.493" offset="6031638">The next step then is that the person or I mean the party must go to Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.544" offset="6063821">At this point and in the Beck case, the Ohio Supreme Court held that the affidavit has a presumption in its favor of good faith and truth and that the Secretary of State in answering that has got to overcome that presumption and further that the Secretary of State has got to come forward with substantial evidence, so this is not the usual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.678" offset="6200389">This is not the situation which the Court had before such as in the Speiser case in which the entire burden of overturning and adverse administrative determination was put on the part of the taxpayer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2362.331" offset="9522955">The second one, the party does not carry on a program of sedition or treason as defined by the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.778" offset="9560781">As my brother points out in his brief, there is no Ohio Criminal Law defining sedition, but there is for treason and that is substantially the same as the treason which is provided by the Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.335" offset="9655030">And the treason citation is 2921.01 of the Ohio Revised Code has to do with the levying of war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.976" offset="9725561">With respect to, I would like to point out to the Court that in the Keyishian case, this Court has specifically validated from vagueness the treason, the use of the word treason with respect to oaths.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.297" offset="9818870">With respect to the third provision, which is that a party is not knowingly associated with the group attempting to overthrow the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.590" offset="9864010">I believe that there is sufficient scienter in there, from both from the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court and the scienter which can be implied from this Court’s case in Duren which was approved in Bengate and also Whitehill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.891" offset="9953244">At page 137 of the Beck case, the Ohio Supreme Court, with respect to this question stated that the individuals involved must be personally, personally engaged, in these activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.978" offset="10033597">But further, if the Court should find that there is not sufficient scienter in the third limitation placed on the oath, we suggest that the Keyishian Case which requires you must have a specific intent to further the illegal aims of the organization would be a proper and further limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.061" offset="10157940">We believe, for all the reasons that the oath as limited is not unduly vague and can be understood by those who required to sign it on behalf of a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.148" offset="10242263">With respect to the Equal Protection claims violations thereof, I believe, it is a legitimate state interest and can reasonably be a legislative by a state legislature, that parties who have perpetually participated in the election process over the years and parties who have not had anyone utilize the state in attempting to overthrow the state by force or violence, that is a perfectly proper and natural use of the power and does not violate the Equal Protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.553" offset="10407879">I would like to point one citation which is not in our brief, which the Court may wish take in consideration in its deliberations and decision on this case and that is Lisker vs. Kelley which was affirmed just last year, 401 U.S. 928.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.136" offset="10506204">That case involved candidates and the use of a candidate’s oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.898" offset="10545283">That oath was found proper in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.308" offset="10574958">In summation, I urged that the Court approve defining a decision of the District Court, I believe that the interest of the State in self-preservation are sufficient to require this party oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.829" offset="10665029">We believe that the grounded decision is still the law of the land and is controlling in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2667.190" offset="10742456">Justice Stewart asked Mr. Guittar as to the steps that the party had actually taken to get on the ballot on Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.754" offset="10780699">I know it as they pointed out in David's file in connection with the motion for summary judgment that I don’t find in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.033" offset="10809852">Did those affidavits make an offer in the institutional information other than the pleadings this Court has been done by the party towards getting on the ballot?</text>

          <turn speaker="sanford_jay_rosen" startTime="2693.631" stopTime="2835.063">
            <label>Mr. Sanford Jay Rosen</label>
            <text syncTime="2693.631" offset="10848199">Your Honor, I cannot honestly say, I have not seen those affidavits in a while myself and I do not recall what they are in the file but your question, it seems to me is a broader question addressed to, precisely the consideration that Mr. Justice Stewart was raising and that was the first point that I did wished to make on rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.878" offset="10937225">And that is, how was the issue raised and why is it in such a rather thin status?</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.881" offset="10961257">It may well be that the affidavit still allege additional harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.178" offset="10978394">The issue was raised in the following form, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.300" offset="10990932">The complaint was filed on January 28, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.593" offset="11008069">Now, for complaint to be filed on that day, it was impossible under the statute for my clients to execute the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.222" offset="11038580">The statute provides that the affidavit must be filed with the Secretary of State between nine months prior to the next election and six months prior to the next election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.903" offset="11081316">Conceivably, they might have waited a few more weeks to actually submit the affidavit or to make a request for consideration on the ballot, for placement on the ballot, without an affidavit or they might have try to fulfill all other requirements for inclusion on the ballot without an affidavit but you have to recall this case has a history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.764" offset="11180790">That case has been before this Court once, twice, the Ohio Election Laws have been before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.012" offset="11213705">This is the third time there was a small portion that the Ohio Election Law has dealt within the Zepalady case, I believe, which this Court did resolved in summary fashion earlier this term, and of course Williams versus Rhodes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.005" offset="11269711">And my clients, reading Williams versus Rhodes, and being cognizant of the fact that they were denied, injunctive relief by you, Mr. Justice Stewart, and then confirmed by the Court in William versus Rhodes for failure to prosecute their cause of action quickly, can hardly be faulted for moving at the earliest possible opportunity to challenge as many as the provisions of the interconnected, into tangled web of Ohio Election Laws which they believe were inhibiting their ability to get ballot position.</text>

            <text syncTime="2868.538" offset="11547863">Well, but you see as the case was formulated, this was one of ten provisions engaged in two separate lawsuits that were consolidated in order to try to bring to an end the questions over the Ohio Elections Laws, our clients, decided to go in one lawsuit and to bring all of their challenges at once.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.358" offset="11643158">It doesn’t seem to me possible that they could have attempted to comply by registration requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.166" offset="11666354">They could not register because they did not have the requisite number of signatures at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.930" offset="11693417">They weren’t in the position yet to attempt to certify that they wanted to have a primary yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.438" offset="11715465">They were challenging the primary provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.679" offset="11724346">They were challenging an entire range of provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.658" offset="11736363">Some of which had some bearing on the rightness, with the pure rightness of the way in, which the affidavit provision might be dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.616" offset="11776173">Now, in order to bring their challenge to the affidavit provision early enough to get complete relief before the 1970 election, they have to bring it all in one lawsuit, and it seems to me that’s the reason why there wasn’t a kind of pleading that Justice Stewart was alluding to, which would focus on the specific harm of this kind of an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.369" offset="11867184">It is my understanding further that the appellees intend to enforce the statute as construed in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.538" offset="11899785">It is my understanding that my clients intend to occupy a ballot position in the 1972 Election and presumably will attempt to have a ballot position in subsequent elections as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.618" offset="11948163">So, they are still operating under the gun of this affidavit requirement and the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.995" offset="11985675">For this election, the appellees or, well I guess he is not a successor at this point, presumably could refuse that position on the ballot for failure to file the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.004" offset="12029665">I know that he is, in fact, precluding them at this election but he could certainly do it in a subsequent election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.599" offset="12064043">So, for those various reasons, we do believe that the pleadings are a little bit skimpy, do assert or an alleged irreparable harm and do meet the test of pleading and state before this Court and adequately right controversy for this position by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.610" offset="12140111">I just wanted to address two other points that came up in argument on the part of the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.014" offset="12161741">The first, perhaps the minor or more minor point, is appellee represents to this Court, to the Supreme Court of Ohio in ex parte Beck versus Hummel, adopted a rule that the affidavit when filed are presumed to be true and made in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.893" offset="12249303">Now, I have been re-reading the language of the Supreme of Ohio on that particular point and perhaps I believe something, but I find that the Supreme Court of Ohio says, there is no showing in the record before the Secretary that anyone connected with the Ohio Wallace for President Committee advocates the overthrow of Government by force.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.696" offset="12328506">And the fact that some members among the many thousands made along to the Communist Party, or the Communist may advocate the election of Wallace is no proof that the affidavit is in accordance with the statute were was not filed in good faith or that it is not efficacious for the purpose for which it was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.651" offset="12392245">All the Supreme Court of Ohio presumable is saying is once that the affidavit is filed, the burden of going forward shifts to the Secretary and he must take some steps to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.568" offset="12439997">It does nothing about the ultimate burden of truth.</text>

            <text syncTime="3102.379" offset="12483151">Perhaps initially, it is presumed to be true. But the next point is, Mr. Justice Marshall, once the Secretary conducts his investigation, his findings are sustained unless they are not supported by a substantial evidence or are against the weight of the evidence which is hardly the kind of test that this Court has applied in cases like Speiser and other cases involving scrutiny of administrative determinations behind upon First Amendment Rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="3527.598" offset="14184036">Right, but I am trying to suggest that it was a complicated lawsuit that was being mounted and that a lot of the energy in terms of the pleadings may have been focused on some of the other provisions as well as upon this provision just as when we formulated our brief to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.448" offset="14263448">But unfortunately we spent some 15 or 16 pages dealing with the issues involved in this particular provision but we focused more on the other provisions that we were attacking as well as this provision and indeed the appellees were found themselves in precisely the same setting in an effort to keep the suit within manageable paper range.</text>
