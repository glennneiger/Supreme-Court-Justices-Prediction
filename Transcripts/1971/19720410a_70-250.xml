            <text syncTime="429.015" offset="1789763">And as specifically so said in our brief, we do challenge that, that that is a misstatement of what California does do.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.409" offset="1823304">I think the question here though is not whether California administratively could do this or whether in terms of social policy they should do it, the question is, has Congress compelled California to do it or not and our position is that it has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.626" offset="1900209">Congress has defined the group of eligible children to be those that lack the support of a parent due to death, incapacity or continued absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.618" offset="1940124">This case specifically is the question what does Congress mean by continued absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.679" offset="1964365">At the time that the case was argued below, all we had was the HEW regulation that Mr. Justice Brennan has just referred to that left it to the state to determine what continued absence met within the scope of HEW's interpretation which was a substantial severance, economic and socially, within the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.805" offset="2060914">And cited as their example, HEW cited as the example, the situation where the father simply deserts the family and disappears.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.567" offset="2103964">The mother knows not where he is or when he will be home or if he will be home.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.227" offset="2122563">A complete destruction of the sociological and economic ties between the father and the child, that's the example that HEW gives.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.208" offset="2170524">We submit nothing more than that in the Act itself and thus given the 35 years that HEW has had this policy and the fact that over the years, the states have exercised the option with Congress doing nothing to disapprove this, and with the result that there is a roughly 50/50 split between the states in terms of which ones do and which ones do not grant aid that we think that the states should be continued the option of defining their own eligibility policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.523" offset="2335722">The question, of course, then arises of what impact on this past pattern does the Court's recent decision in Townsend case have on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.818" offset="2376996">Townsend, of course, is the Illinois AFDC case in which the state of Illinois had defined an eligible student to be one who was enrolled only in a vocational school, excluding those that were enrolled in academic institutions; colleges, universities non-vocational.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.476" offset="2459543">The Court in Townsend held -- found that Congress had explicitly defined what it meant by a student.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.044" offset="2497890">The Federal Act itself specifically said that a student was any child up to the age of 21, enrolled in any educational institution and furthermore that Congress had made clear that it intended that the states must grant assistance to all types of students.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.308" offset="2574899">Therefore, the Court held that Illinois obviously could not define student in a fashion that directly conflicted with the definition provided by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.344" offset="2627040">I would submit that on its facts, Townsend is completely distinguishable from this case, in that there is neither the precise congressional definition of continued absence, nor is there any indication, legislative history-wise or otherwise, that Congress intended that the states have to grant assistance in all types of continued absence or that there had to be a nationally uniform definition to the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.015" offset="2777714">Assuming for the sake of argument that we have misread the Townsend case and that it does mean in the Court's view that there must be a nationally uniform standards for all aspects of the AFDC Program and that Congress or HEW, presumably HEW, must give content to the vague term used by Congress, we would submit then that the definition should be held to be of ineligibility for serviceman standards for the following reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.080" offset="2962034">In the case of King versus Smith, this Court traced the legislative history and outlined, delimited the contours of the AFDC Program as the Court perceived it, which was that Congress was not intending to aid all needy children, but rather that it was endeavoring to provide financial assistance to states for the purpose of aiding children who lacked a breadwinner.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.425" offset="3107379">I think a reading of the King case makes clear that it's a lack of a breadwinner and not merely a wage earner who can't bring home enough bread.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.518" offset="3171745">In other words that AFDC is not designed to be a subsidy for low paying employers be it the United States government or otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.434" offset="4347360">Turning then to the equal protection question which the appellee's raise which again dovetails I believe with our suggestion or our contention that if there must be a uniform standard vis-à-vis a servicemen families that it should be ineligibility that for the same reason, it's not a denial of equal protection to deny benefits to serviceman's families when at the same time granting them to families of, for example, prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.385" offset="4499183">It's (Inaudible) I believe that the Equal Protection Clause does not require states or federal government to treat classes that are in fact different, legally differently.</text>

            <text syncTime="1196.537" offset="4859778">Or whether he is away from home, the child is not needy there which is the second facet of eligibility which is not present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.007" offset="4893737">We are assuming that the child is needy in this case and the state has conceded that the plaintiffs, the appellees in the case, the named plaintiffs are needy and by definition, the class represented by the named plaintiffs are those families that are needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.498" offset="4971686">So that aspect of eligibility is not an issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.564" offset="4991957">It's strictly the question of dependency or whether the father is continuously absent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.852" offset="5017035">Again then the economic implications are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.325" offset="5038978">The imprisoned father or deported father can offer no economic security to the child and sociologically we believe that there is a substantial difference both in terms of the disruptive influence in terms of the family ties of military service and imprisonment with a super imposition of the social ostracism that goes with imprisonment or deportation which we think in a normal situation anyway is totally lacking in the case of military service.</text>

            <text syncTime="1284.489" offset="5211595">Well, now does the legislative history of the act of Congress make these distinctions you're talking about or are these just advanced as your considerations?</text>

            <text syncTime="1298.550" offset="5267915">We view the legislative history of the Act as supporting these contentions and furthermore this Court's tracing and delimiting of the Act's scope in King versus Smith as erecting these kind of limits around the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.653" offset="5368329">As I read King, the suggestion is there that Congress was concerned in the AFDC program with a limited class of children and the Court says in King specifically that the Act is not designed to aid all needy children, but the class is only those that lack the breadwinner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.766" offset="5472715">And the Court talks in King about the lack of the likelihood of any economic security enduring to the child in the King case from the mother's paramour who owe the child no duty and support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.082" offset="5550037">It's from that that I draw the economic aspect that there is a lack of likelihood of economic protection for the child from the father and that that mashed with the economic problem is the social impact, the destruction of the family ties through death, divorce, continued absence from the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.866" offset="5701129">But that analogizing the continued absence facet of eligibility to the other facets; death and incapacity, desertion and so on, I think it's from that, that I withdraw the sociological or intrafamilial association that I am referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.216" offset="5794543">I don't think it's of my imagination, but I think that it's clearly as Congress has limited the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.119" offset="5830174">Now the District Court adverts briefly to the possibility that my characterization of a less severe dislocation occurring in the service situation as opposed to imprisonment is perhaps overstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.695" offset="5900496">Well, it may very well be that in certain service situation, service connected absences, that there is indeed a severe dislocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.289" offset="5942814">Assuming that nothing else happens though in terms of a breakup of the marriage, the fact that in certain military situations, there may be severe dislocation, does not mean that there is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.412" offset="6003314">As the Court has pointed out on numerous occasions that Clause does not require absolute mathematical precision in drawing the classes and sovereign equity is more right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.551" offset="6055872">But furthermore, if in the situation of the service connected absence, other factors of dislocative significance, that is a divorce occurs as the result of the father being drafted, the child will then become eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.213" offset="6146569">It's -- California's position is that military absence by itself is insufficient, but if the other factors such as a divorce, a breakup of the marriage occurs, then the family would be in the situation which we believe Congress intended to cover by AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.596" offset="6276032">But in the normal situation where the only thing that exists to arguably give rise to eligibility is the father's absence by reason of his employment, be it military or civilian, then California does not grant assistance and we do not believe that either the Social Security Act or the Fourteenth Amendment requires that result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1737.091" offset="7022089">The court below found that -- California has further defined the term dependent child by providing that when a needy child is deprived of parental support or care by reason of the continued absence of a parent and that absence is occasioned by his military service, there is no continued absence such as to give rise to dependency and AFDC eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.584" offset="7132013">The court below found the state regulation invalid on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.556" offset="7151866">One that the Social Security Act mandates that all eligible individuals be granted AFDC benefits with reason proffers, and number two that the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in its implementing regulation mandated that the states in developing their policy as to what constitutes continued absence from the home must take into consideration military absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.556" offset="7247892">And the court further read this to provide that the states must consider each case on its individual merits and not on the basis of the group to which our case belongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.009" offset="7293763">I would add at this point that the Department of Health, Education and Welfare through the Solicitor General has filed a brief in this case, indicating that it agrees with appellant's argument that the states are free to define continued absence from the home as they choose, but indicating that it disagrees with appellant's argument that military orphans as we have called them are not federally eligible for AFDC benefits, and it is the second argument that I would like to address myself to first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.006" offset="7409747">We submit that when Congress used the words continued absence from the home that it meant exactly what the plain English definition of those words is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.253" offset="7458648">When Congress said continued absence from the home, it meant those situations in which a parent is not physically present in the home and this non-presence can be expected to continue for a certain length of time which are called continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.950" offset="7521446">I would point out as an example of what continued absence means, the situation of the Remillard family in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3240.159" offset="13034328">May I just refer briefly to the Townsend decision to respond to what Ms. Massey says that the decision holds and I don't mean to be presumptuous in telling the Court what it held in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.530" offset="13087827">But I believe that it's difficult to read the decision as having any applicability here in that in Townsend, Congress had very clearly defined what a student was in terms of who as a student was going to be eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.396" offset="13159298">The Court then said that Congress having squarely made the person eligible, the state can't say that the person is ineligible and it's only in that context I believe that the Court struck down HEW's condition acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.706" offset="13236516">And condition acts is merely the deference -- the deferential policy of HEW, in this case and in any other case of allowing states to define eligibility for that state's program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.054" offset="13301926">Now, I don't believe that the Court in Townsend struck down condition acts in all instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.738" offset="13340587">Now, that's my point that in this case, the Court may want in Remillard case, the Court may choose to say that there must be national standards and in this case, may disapprove in toto condition acts, but it did not do so we would submit in the Townsend case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.233" offset="13426583">For -- one final point, that the Administration Welfare Bill H.R.1 which is now pending and has been for some time, one of the most highly touted aspects of that Bill is that it establishes nationally uniform standards, one of the things lacking in AFDC.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.067" offset="13513936">So I would submit that clearly AFDC does not, that the Social Security Act does not require national standards, particularly in this case where Congress has used the vague term, continued absence and defer to HEW for 35 years in allowing the states to set their own definitions.</text>
