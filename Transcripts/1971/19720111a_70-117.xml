            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="74016">We will hear argument next in Number 70-117, Kastigar against the United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hugh R. Manes</label>
            <text syncTime="28.112" offset="186447">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.016" offset="205987">This case involves the constitutionality of the federal use immunity statute Title 18 Sections 6002 and 6003.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.671" offset="264605">The question presented in this case, whether federal use immunity as conferred by Section 6002 is coextensive with the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.449" offset="327717">This case arises from the imprisonment for civil contempt of the petitioners, both of them, by the federal district Court or the central district of California for refusing to answer questions put to them by the -- before the grand jury for violations or alleged violations of the selective service law.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.862" offset="437432">The petitioners were accorded use immunity by the United States Attorney and ordered to answer by the United States District Court pursuant to that immunity which was conferred under Section 6002 and they declined to answer the questions in any event invoking their privilege on their theory that the immunity offered by 6002 was incomplete.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.155" offset="562610">Petitioners contend here that only transactional immunity will satisfy the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.610" offset="604406">We take that position for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.246" offset="622901">First, the history and development of the privilege and the logic compel absolute immunity be granted and nothing less.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.960" offset="661771">Secondly, we argue that so called tainted evidence, rules required for the administration and control and supervision of the use in these statute are inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.833" offset="729272">They cannot guarantee the absolute immunity which the Fifth Amendment demand requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.638" offset="760514">Thirdly, we take the position that the statutorial language of 6003 so limits the Court power as to prevent a fair and reasonable application of use immunity and in particularly prevent adequate Court supervision of the use of that particular immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.517" offset="852047">Finally we argue that use immunity conferred by 6002 coupled with existing statute for example the Jenks Act rule 16 and other provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.702" offset="904814">As such has to deprive the witness of due process and abridge his right guarantee him by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments and particularly to render these immunity statutes at bar unfair as against the subject witness who may become an accused person.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.898" offset="989556">Before I proceed with that argument, I would like to point out something about this particular statute that we are dealing with which is in response to questions put to prior counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.048" offset="1030202">This I would respectfully submit, is use immunity statute that has no limitations indeed it is called a general immunity law.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.852" offset="1069386">It is not limited in its application to simply multi-defendant cases nor is it limited in any way to any particular kind of offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.130" offset="1110450">It permits immunity to be granted and the witness to be compelled to answer and virtually, most if not all offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.212" offset="1146813">And certainly as again, whether the person is an individual and charged or suspected of only an individual crime as well as of course, the multiple defendant offense in this kind of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.747" offset="1196968">And we submit that where you have a statute that is as broad as the statute at bar from a prosecution point of view if it is there, it is going to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.156" offset="1254542">And it is limited in its use.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.797" offset="1273141">It has to be approved by somebody in Washington at least besides the assistant attorney general level or it has to be ascertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.946" offset="1309712">It has to be the authority for giving, immunity must be approved by the attorney general or its authorized representative, but I would submit Your Honor that under Section 6002 has to be as –</text>

            <text syncTime="355.115" offset="1494450">I would assume Your Honor that that would be true in both cases but I could not represent as to its effect with regard to the house or congress might certainly confirm that that would be true as regards immunity for a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.000" offset="1557980">And I would add to that if the Court please, that the representations maybe made through the Court as mere conclusions as they were below with regard not only to the authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.803" offset="1621196">And I would further point out that all that the United States Attorney may show is a conclusionary statement that it is in the public interest for the government to grant immunity and to inquire also really of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.062" offset="1706251">He may not -- he is not required to show in the Court cannot demand that he show reasonable cause for intruding on the privacy, I think this is a very important thing that we are talking about a secret proceedings such as the grand jury as in this case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hugh R. Manes</label>
            <text syncTime="451.883" offset="1881480">It simply shows that the United States Attorney represented, that there was a public interest in having the petitioners appear before the grand jury with use of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.964" offset="1929859">That they would invoke the Fifth or indeed had done so in the case of Kastigar and that the privilege was made with good faith with the approval of the Attorney General of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.449" offset="1979805">That is all the showing that was required and I want to reiterate that the showing that is made there is without any detail as to in what respect there is a reasonable cause, it is just a conclusionary statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.802" offset="2033200">Now, I wanted to urge upon this Court why we take, why it is important to us at least that transaction immunity be regard as the very limit for the Fifth Amendment for the grant of any kind of immunity and I would urge upon this Court that it is the government that wants immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.567" offset="2136227">When we talk you know, of giving immunity back, I would urge this Court to consider that it is the government that is seeking to force a person to testify against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.873" offset="2193487">And they are seeking that immunity, they are seeking that testimony to compel him to testify against himself because they want some information and he is not convenient for doing that.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="589.287" offset="2431097">But nobody except for Justice Blackmun agreed with it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="hugh_r_manes" startTime="592.699" stopTime="1134.255">
            <label>Mr. Hugh R. Manes</label>
            <text syncTime="592.699" offset="2444785">I know that Your Honor and so I am taking it from there.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.550" offset="2460145">But if the Court please, I -- there is an argument that is being made that the Fifth Amendment protects only use of compelled testimony, and I want to address myself to that just for a moment and point out that the Fifth Amendment has been held by this Court in Ullmann not to be interpreted in a hostile or negative spirit, and that it is to be construed liberally to effectuate its intent and purposes and that was the holding of course in Spivak versus Kline (ph) as well as many other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.182" offset="2594728">And so I would note that there is not just one purpose as this Court observed in Murphy at page 55 and as observed as long ago as Boyd versus United States, the Fifth Amendment has many purposes that had to be considered when you are evaluating the question of whether use immunity is efficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.511" offset="2679992">For one thing, the Fifth Amendment was designed and came in to our constitution to prevent disclosures by torture and well, I submit that maybe some may feel that that is kind of remote now, we are in a modern age.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.074" offset="2750209">I would remind this Court that it was only 30 years ago when this Court was forced to deal with the problems of third degree in Brown versus Mississippi, Chambers versus Florida and a whole series of cases and only a few years ago when this Court had a hold Miranda that it was necessary for an accused to be given a warning about the effect of this testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.453" offset="2855743">So we are concerned with the scope of that protection as applied to coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.044" offset="2882179">But in addition to that, the Court please I would submit that the Fifth Amendment also has policy consideration which is long been the concern of this Court, that is the distrust that we have of coerced testimony, the distrust we have of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.261" offset="2946963">I would submit that in Brown versus United States which was decided only a year after Walker versus Brown, this Court made a very important observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.589" offset="2992312">It recognized at page 547 168 U.S., the human mind under the pressure of calamity is easily seduced and is liable and the alarm of danger to acknowledge indiscriminately, a falsehood or a truth as different agitations may prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.604" offset="3080396">And why I think that particular quotation is apt here is because the petitioners here are put in the position of avoiding jail not simply because they have been granted immunity or be held in contempt, but that they are compelled to avoid jail by giving information which they think the government may want to hear and ought to avoid prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.424" offset="3215711">Now, that is a tendency, I would respectfully submit, that is inherent in any use immunity statute and certainly in the one involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.403" offset="3251551">But there is another policy consideration here too and the Court please, and that is that it is to avoid not simply a trilemma but a quatrolemma if the Court please of self accusation, perjury and contempt and the possibility of prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.532" offset="3324067">I would submit that Brown versus Walker deals with that dilemma or that quatrolemma as I prefer to call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.756" offset="3365027">Very succinctly and poignantly and remember this is in 1896 when the Court there is talking about the policies which gave rise to the Fifth Amendment and it observed that if an accused person be asked to explain his apparent connection with the crime under investigation, the ease with which the question has put to him may assume an inquisitorial character, the temptation to press the witness unduly to (Inaudible) him, if he be timid or reluctant, to push him into a corner and to entrap him.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.331" offset="3507237">To entrap him into fatal contradictions which is so painfully evident in many of the early state trials made the systems so audios as to give rise to a demand for its total abolition.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.890" offset="3557497">In the context of this case, I would respectfully submit in response to a question that was posed to counsel this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.887" offset="3585500">That the accused here does not hold exclusively the keys to his jail door.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.621" offset="3624475">On the contrary, it is like anyone who has money and has a safety deposit box, he shares that with the bank and so here, the accused shares the keys with the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.787" offset="3673063">For well it is true that he can talk and thus open the door of contempt that has confined him in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.362" offset="3703365">The government holds the key as to whether his talking may lead to a desire to prosecute him and therefore I submit that when we are talking about quatrolemmal, we are not talking about the policy and the privilege, we have to consider this possibility as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.573" offset="3780269">We have to consider what was said by this Court in another cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.825" offset="3797301">The choice here that the accused has between the rock and whirlpool multiplied.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.949" offset="3817781">And there is another consideration to Court please and that is the basic respect which this society has for the inviolability of the person and his privacy as the Court noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.892" offset="3869503">In Mallory versus Hogan as it noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.559" offset="3876191">In Miranda versus Arizona and it is certainly noted long ago in the Boyd case when it observed that any compulsory discovery by extorting the parties oath or compelling the production of his private books and papers to convict him of a crime or deport that his poverty certainly is a principle that merges into the Fourth and the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.090" offset="3958320">And another point, we have here in our society a preference for the prosecutorial system, for the accusatorial system, which places the burden entirely on the government, and not for the inquisitorial process, which I would respectfully submit certainly in the context of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.896" offset="4049539">It takes place in the grand jury room where the accused is without a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.762" offset="4068974">Where he has no protection whatsoever but where he is faced with a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.551" offset="4092171">And I would respectfully submit that given the secrecy which attends all grand jury proceedings and the secrecy which prevails thereafter as the decisions of this Court have made quite apparent in many cases, that it will be extremely, the accused will be extremely hard put not to feel a sense of entrapment by the circumstances which attempt the use immunity situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.406" offset="4195616">But there is one additional consideration which I think underscores the Fifth Amendment as I read the cases of this Court and that is the notion of a sense of fair play which requires the government to let the individual alone unless it has reasonable cause to justify intruding upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.051" offset="4270117">Now, as I pointed out earlier in my comments, This statute gives the accused no opportunity whatsoever nor indeed the Court to inquire whether there was reasonable cause to peruse his privacy or indeed his defenses and allows the government to ransack his defenses as the accused is not permitted to do with respect to government files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.898" offset="4373562">Now, I would respectfully submit that there is other considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.186" offset="4398744">That for example the protection of the innocent even though some guilty may benefit incidentally, that is a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.808" offset="4437196">That is a choice which government makes in the context list of this kind of statute and it is a choice which is made upon the circumstance that if the accused has something that it wants to have badly, then the government should be put to the choice as it was put to the choice in Rosairo, as it was put to the choice in Andolshek and Coplin and a number of other cases, it has got to choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.824" offset="4545239">If it wants to have information, then it will have the information that avoid prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.364" offset="4571466">But if it wants to prosecute, then prosecute and let the privilege remain the sanctuary of the individual who is presumed to be innocent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1166.769" offset="4741053">I am not aware of any Mr. Chief Justice but I would say that there are some cases which show the difficulties that Courts have had even with transactional immunity although the difficulties are not going to compound with use immunity but I do not hold any empirical data in the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.997" offset="4826003">Finally, I want to submit one other additional consideration to this Court for policy consideration, and that is the respect for law and the orderly process of administration that comes with the idea that a man cannot be compelled to accuse himself and which will be undermined when there is even the suspicion that an accused has been given, that there maybe some evidence that is being used to taint his trial that has come from his own mouth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.503" offset="4971975">I remember reading somewhere, I think it was in Moore versus Dempsey where Mr. Justice Holmes once said that it is not only important to give justice or to do justice but to give the appearance of justice and I think that this is an important consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.913" offset="5033624">Now, I am not going to here debate, the question whether Counselman ought to is dicta it is not -- I take the position it is not dicta but obviously this Court is concerned to reevaluate the problem that the Counselman addressed itself too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.821" offset="5089213">And I would however point out to this Court that there have been a -- the Ninth Circuit affirmed of the use immunity statute here, that has not been true in a Seventh Circuit, that has not been true in the Third Circuit, citation to the Satina case, Satina versus Elias being in the 449 F 2, page 40 and more recently just recently, the Eighth Circuit also took the view that the Ninth Circuit was an error and viewed, viewed the underlying policy considerations of Counselmen as prevailing and I refer here to United States versus McDaniel 449 f 2 832 at page 838.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.442" offset="5271756">That case incidentally is kind of interesting because it addresses itself to one of the questions that was put to counsel early this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.937" offset="5301745">When counsel was asked about weather he was overzealous, whether a prosecutor was going to be overzealous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.380" offset="5327449">In that particular case, I would point out that counsel there was the federal prosecutor who because he was informed by his administrative agencies that there was a suspicion that a bank president was defalcating and embezzling monies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.633" offset="5388472">Turn the matter over to a State to the state of North or South Dakota and the State then held an immunity grand jury proceeding, on the ground of immunity and then at the request of the United States Attorney, turned that transcript over to the United States Attorney for prosecution and indictment followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.804" offset="5461196">I would say that the Court there held, that that was prime facie evidence of the use of fruits but I would also point out that it demonstrates as does of course, the Berger in 295 U.S. and number of other cases demonstrates that prosecutors can be at times overzealous and particularly when conferred with such extensive power as appears to be the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.749" offset="5552938">But when I first spoke, I suggested that there were other compelling reasons why I believe use immunity should not prevail and one of the most important of those reasons of course is that it is inadequate, that the rules that are designed to enforce and administer the use immunity concept are just simply unable to effectively displace the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.037" offset="5642068">In short, what I content, what we contented in our briefs is that that the rules that are designed to protect the Fourth and Fifth Amendment in search and seizure cases and in the forced confession case are simply not adequate to protect or to at least define the limits of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.297" offset="5739139">In short, what is happening here, what is being argued for here is the use of essentially procedural rules to define the substantive rights of a witness and I submit that that cannot be done without creating some terrible problems for an accused who is questioning whether the evidence used against him in a subsequent prosecution had this tainted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.110" offset="5846450">Let me suggest some concrete examples of what I am referring to in this concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.993" offset="5873931">First of all, California, the California Supreme Court decided in People versus Dickson 57 Cal 2 at page 415, that was a forced confession case and it held there that the fruits of a forced confession were not admissible but it went on to hold that the fruits of a forced confession may not be admissible but that if the evidence was discoverable, was discoverable by law enforcement that therefore that under those circumstances there was an attenuation and that evidence would be admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.129" offset="6022516">And that same theory that was used in the Dickson case and in subsequent California Supreme Court cases, and the case of like nature has also been applied by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Wayne versus United States 318 federal second and it was applied most recently by the Ninth Circuit in a case, United States versus Jackson 448 federal second at page 970 where the Court and I am quoting said “it would be speculative to conclude that but for such information, the police would not have identified defendants or learned their place of residence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.691" offset="6184684">I would like to reserve some time for reply, thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="1535.335" offset="6215299">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.200" offset="6238809">The facts of this case are simple and not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.274" offset="6259080">The respondent here was ordered to testify under pursuant to Section 6002 of Title XVIII of the United States code, he refused to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.630" offset="6332432">The question is whether his sentence were contempt for failing to comply with that order can be sustained consistently with the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.492" offset="6379975">Of course, the language of the Fifth Amendment is familiar to all of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.379" offset="6399515">It is one of the shortest and the simplest clauses in the constitution but I think it is worthwhile to get back to the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.089" offset="6438280">I do not suggest for a moment that it should be construed literally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.889" offset="6453536">On the other hand I do not think that it should be regarded as a take off point for a vast expansion which has sometimes occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.409" offset="6491570">But the language is that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.085" offset="6526261">And the language of Section 6002 which is Section 201 A of the organized crime control act of 1970 is that though the witness is required to testify under that statute, no testimony or other information compelled under the order or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information maybe used against the witness in any criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.732" offset="6660844">The problem arises because of the language in Counselman against Hitchcock, 80 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.678" offset="6692713">The case it seems to me is a sort of jurisprudential case and example of the process by which the law grows and develops In this case, after rather extended delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.955" offset="6757810">We now know that there are at least three measures or varieties of immunity, not two as we long assumed in support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.022" offset="6802009">The use immunity, which was involved in Counselman and Hitchcock and was held to be inadequate and invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.584" offset="6836282">There is extended use immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.365" offset="6847463">Immunity not only to the use of the testimony but to its fruits which is what is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.319" offset="6879227">And finally there is transactional immunity giving amnesty or pardon with respect to any offense covered by the testimony and that was held to be sufficient in Brown and Walker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.343" offset="6943384">There is complete agreement as to the invalidity of use immunity alone and as to the validity of transactional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.384" offset="6987479">The problem arises and is presented here with respect to the validity under the Fifth Amendment of full extended use immunity applicable not only to the evidence given but also to the fruits of such evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.419" offset="7067623">The situation that seems to me comes within the examples of which the common law is filled which are dealt with in by Dean Pound in his work on jurisprudence, volume three page 564 where he says we must distinguish subsequent judicial rejection of the reasoning by which the result was reached in a prior case and substitution of different reasoning leading to the same result from a changed course of decision and he concludes it cannot be insisted upon too often that the common law technique does not make the language authoritative, much less a binding authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.424" offset="7267616">It is the result which passes into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.964" offset="7293843">No one saw the distinction between use immunity and what I will call extended or complete use immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.476" offset="7327907">For almost 75 years after Counselman against Hitchcock was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.592" offset="7352357">I thought a lot about the privilege against self-incrimination, some 17 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.899" offset="7377539">But I did not see the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.546" offset="7388197">Mr. Mayer’s in his thought provoking book called 'Should the Fifth Amendment be amended', published in 1959 did not see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.434" offset="7435740">Judge Friendly in his lectures on reconsideration of the Fifth Amendment published several years ago did not refer to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1860.175" offset="7514630">And in immunity against the use of the evidence and all of its fruits construed as broadly as the Court feels it should be construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.734" offset="7560919">The fact was that for ordinary purposes, the question was concealed because immediately after Counselman and Hitchcock was decided, Congress picked up the sweeping the language which Mr. Justice Buchwald has used in a part of his opinion there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.154" offset="7630614">The statute which Congress enacted was introduced in the Congress 12 days after Counselman against Hitchcock was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.801" offset="7661125">And Congress provided full transactional immunity in nearly every case where it required the testimony be given in one case where it gave only the narrow use immunity, the Court did held that that was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.529" offset="7736044">Congress did this because it thought it had to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.451" offset="7755792">It was only many years later, when this Court found for the first time that the Fifth Amendment applied in terms of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.349" offset="7787348">In 1964 seven and a half years ago, the question rose to the surface.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.255" offset="7814934">It came in through the side door so to speak because Congress by its statutory language had left no room for it to come before the Court directly in a federal criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.459" offset="7871776">Now the case to which I refer is of course Murphy against the Waterfront commission where the immunity was granted by a Bi-state Organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.584" offset="7924334">It was held that the state had no power to grant immunity, transactional immunity against a federal prosecution but the Court sustained the statute by holding that under its supervisory power or in some other way it did not wholly clear the testimony obtained in the Bi-state Proceeding could not be used nor could its fruits be used in a federal prosecution and that that complied with the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.762" offset="8073023">The issue was implicit and Mr. Justice Goldberg’s opinion for the Court in that case for example, 378 U.S. at page 78 and 79, Justice Goldberg’s statement of Counselman against Hitchcock refers several times and only to use and its fruits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.177" offset="8182633">It was explicit in Mr. Justice White’s concurring opinion and in the Courts opinion, the opinion of Justice Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.195" offset="8226728">The conclusion was, that the testimony could not be compelled unless the compelled testimony and its fruits cannot be used in any manner by federal officials in connection with a criminal prosecution against it and then he repeated the conclusion that the federal authorities would not be allowed to use the evidence or its fruits and said this exclusionary rule of permitting the States to secure information necessary for effective law enforcement leaves the witness and the federal government in substantially the same position as if the witness had claimed his privilege in the absence of the state grant of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.425" offset="8415645">And the distinction was explicit and the opinion of Mr. Justice White concurring on that case and if it was that opinion I think which brought it well out into the open and got a lot of people to thinking and resulted in the work by professor Dickson of George Washington University incidentally he has filed a brief in the Zicarelli case on behalf of the National District Attorneys Association which seems to me as an excellent brief and which I hope will be considered in connection with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.479" offset="8579903">Since then, the Court has several times given intimations that extended use immunity is sufficient in Gardner against Broderick for example in 392 U.S., the Court said answers maybe compelled regardless of the privilege if there is immunity from federal and state use of the compelled testimony for its fruits in connection with the criminal prosecution against the person testifying and more recently last term in United States against Freed, the Court upheld the latest version of the firearm statute under situation which I think analysis will show can be supported only if extended use immunity is adequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2549.741" offset="10272952">Congress then immediately stepped in and passed the statute saying stock dividends are not taxable and it was not possible to raise any further question under that statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2625.312" offset="10575240">Now, the Court may well be concerned about the practical effect of a decision along the lines I have indicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2666.248" offset="10738976">Let me suggest the following considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.477" offset="10763845">As to evidence, first discovered after immunity has been granted, there should be a heavy burden on the government to show that any such evidence is not the fruit of a lead or clue resulting from or uncovered by the compelled testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.486" offset="10855900">This should not be a conclusive presumption because there can be cases where the government can demonstrate that such evidence was independently derived.</text>

            <text syncTime="3142.699" offset="12644765">He now has complete immunity against prosecution for any part of the murder because that was a transaction as to which he testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.622" offset="12680501">With respect to use immunity, he will get immunity only with respect to what he does testify and thus he will testify much more widely and freely under use immunity and than under transactional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.405" offset="12743613">Giving him extended use immunity, leaves him no worse than he was before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.661" offset="12772556">It does not require that he be put in a better position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.493" offset="12787916">And none of his testimony or its fruits can be used against him but the evidence already available and demonstrably wholly independent of the testimony he gives remains available and can be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.020" offset="12838072">So this clearly guilty man will not go as scot free.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.156" offset="12858552">Let me put the same thing in another way because this has a relation to the Sixth Amendment and its constitutionally guaranteed right, the defendant shall have compulsory process of witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.250" offset="12906930">Suppose you are prosecuting A and B and B says, comes to the District Attorney and says I want to use A as a witness on my behalf and A says nothing doing, I cannot testify without showing I was there and that will incriminate me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.411" offset="13007658">The B says to the District Attorney, we will give him immunity, and the District Attorney says nothing doing, I can only give him transactional immunity, I am not going to let him off, we know well that he is guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.822" offset="13053216">But if the District Attorney can give him use immunity, then B can get the benefit of A’s testimony such as it is without A having to be given a pardon or amnesty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.453" offset="13103789">And thus there seems to me that somewhat as in the Simon’s case where the Fifth and the Fourth Amendments were pressed together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.895" offset="13133569">We have here a way in which the allowance of use immunity under the Fifth Amendment will help to support the compulsory process which is given by the Sixth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3357.240" offset="13502940">My time is expired but I would suggest that there are problems about waiver which come into that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3391.748" offset="13640971">And if the Court finds that question is derived indirectly by way of using the evidence which was obtained under compulsion.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hugh R. Manes</label>
            <text syncTime="3533.110" offset="14206365">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.297" offset="14215143">Few remarks on my rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.027" offset="14222039">First I want to state that the case I was referring to the California Supreme Court case, People versus Dickson, 57 Cal second 415 and there are several other cases that I have referred to in my opening brief of the same elk at page 40 of our opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.302" offset="14291211">Second point, I want to make and demonstrate through this case is that although the government here says we would give, you know --- we would only rely upon the rule that the government must show that it has not discovered rather than use the discoverable rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.174" offset="14358712">I would point out to this Court that we are talking about the rules as they now exist and are followed in the various circuits and in the States, and therefore, if the Court is of a mind to be thinking in terms of use immunity, it seems to me that the very minimum that is required at this point is to straighten out the rules first before use immunity be considered as within the scope of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.328" offset="14475322">The other point, I want to make is that although the government here talks about having ample evidence before,-- I will cite that example above, that accused that has ample evidence before he is given immunity, I would say to the government, why do they not get a conviction, then when they have got a conviction they can get the testimony without conferring immunity because of course, they have no reason for the rule for the privilege falls but I cannot see as Mr. Justice Stewart points out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.326" offset="14587231">I cannot see giving -- we already have use immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.928" offset="14609696">I mean, no Court is going to allow compelled testimony to come in, we have that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.265" offset="14631012">And then the very minimum, the government must give us something more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.480" offset="14643864">Now, the other point I want to make is the heavy burden that the government talks about is a losery, it is losery because although the government can seize that any testimony that aids the government in the prosecution would fall without the rule, I would point out that there are some very compelling examples to show that the government can and will benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.862" offset="14733412">For example, when use immunity is given to a witness, he will be in a grand jury proceeding, he will be asked some other things about his witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.399" offset="14775521">He will giving information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.652" offset="14784612">Now, the prosecutor who examines him could very well be as the case may turn out, the prosecutor would prosecute him ultimately and will have the benefit certainly of information on which to draw his cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.772" offset="14853053">But even more compelling in the fact that in this particular context we are dealing with a series of problems and rules that as that I pointed out exist and there is no way to escape from them, we have rules for example that come from Wang San and Adonis which talk about well a little bit of evidence if it is tainted is alright, if it is attenuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.535" offset="14964125">Now, if you are going to talk about defining what are the Fifth Amendment privileges?</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.629" offset="14984501">Is whether use immunity is as broad as the Fifth Amendment privilege, the Fifth Amendment says nothing about allowing a little bit of tainted evidence to be compelled and used against the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.655" offset="15040612">When we are talking here about the developing rules, we have our Chaplin versus United States saying that the announcing the harmless error rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.205" offset="15078751">Does that mean that if a Court ultimately concludes that well, a tainted evidence perhaps was used from the mouth of the accused but after all it is harmless in terms of the total context of the case, have we not then abridged the rule?</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.215" offset="15130787">And these are the rules we respectfully submit that are used to define the use immunity and use immunity therefore comes to use something like “humpty dumpy,” once the egg is broken, it can never be put together again the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.414" offset="15191600">Thank you.</text>
