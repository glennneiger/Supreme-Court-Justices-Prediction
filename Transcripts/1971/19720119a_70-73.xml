          <heading>Argument of Mark</heading>
          <turn speaker="mark" startTime="0.000" stopTime="305.403">
            <label>Mr. Mark</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="74014">Mr. Chief Justice and if court please, to continue with my preface, if you will to the argument, yesterday I was expressing the proposition that perhaps the court has not become acquainted with the realities of the situation which lawyers and perhaps judges are faced with when approaching an obscenity case when it is put into the criminal context.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.211" offset="202850">For instance the Fifth Circuit in a case of US vs Groner decided January 11, 1972 Mr. Justice Thornberry expressed some apprehension that he could not understand what was happening in the obscenity field and certainly could not make any determinations for himself as to what was obscene or not obscene in the absence of expert testimony and also express that we thought in line with several other cases that a national standard as far as contemporary standards would seem to be just the ticket under the circumstances of that material goes between states.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.356" offset="375363">The case at bar is very interesting I think when you examine the history of this case Mr. Miller and it illustrates in my opinion why Harris v. Younger was decided wrongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.198" offset="438788">Mr. Miller has a company which publishes and it's in Covina, which is in the County of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.836" offset="469299">They send mailers out, brochures out.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.329" offset="483301">Brochures went to Los Angeles County, Orange County, San Diego County, and to the various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.238" offset="510886">You must understand that within the various Counties there are district attorneys and city attorneys who are responsible for bringing prosecutions and it's up to their discretion as to whether or not a prosecution will be had.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.932" offset="561668">That is a complaint filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.955" offset="569818">Now, in Mr. Millers case there were prosecutions filed in perhaps 15 different municipal courts on the same brochures within the County of Los Angeles in different municipal courts, different district attorneys, deputies of the same County, prosecution in Orange County, prosecutions in San Diego County, and this is what happened in Orange County.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.127" offset="670442">First of all, in Los Angeles County we brought a motion and that is just illustrated in the clerk's transcript before Judge Arguelles in East Los Angeles Judicial District and the motion was presented in which we had expert witnesses testifying that the material was not obscene, and was constitutionally protected and Judge Arguelles made a determination dismissing the action that the material wasn't that protected as set forth -- for the reason set forth in the various cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.871" offset="801472">After that, the Orange County prosecution was started, same brochures, same defendant, same plaintiffs to -- with the people of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.548" offset="836163">So what did we do in Orange County?</text>
            <text syncTime="192.824" offset="845253">We went to the first trial judge and we made a motion to dismiss on the grounds that it was constitutionally protected, presented expert witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.128" offset="878481">The people presented none, the judge denied the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.302" offset="895199">We then took a petition to writ of prohibition to the Superior Court in Orange County to stay the proceedings, writ of prohibition denied out of hand, appealed to the Orange County to the Court of Appeals, Second Appellate District for a stay, a writ of supersedeas.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.501" offset="975970">Denied, Supreme Court of the State of California denied, no stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.621" offset="996450">We then went habeas corpus route through the courts alleging that the material was protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.796" offset="1025185">We went to the Superior Court, the Court of Appeals, Supreme Court, all denied out of hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.212" offset="1050785">Also alleging if you please in the habeas corpus proceedings that there was a res judicata, as estoppel, Ashe versus Swenson, Waller versus Florida decided by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.534" offset="1096133">The material is protected, it can't be prosecuted, denied, out of hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.774" offset="1121106">No court to date as a matter of fact, if you now consider the fact and I think I misspoke myself, that I said a seven week trial, it was not, it was a seven day trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.314" offset="1159245">But this is not, this is a very short trial for obscenity cases as a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.710" offset="1180770">After all of these pre-trial proceedings in which we were trying to get nothing but an adversary hearing, we then went to trial with a jury, a conviction, an affirmance without an opinion in which the Appellate Court completely abdicated its own responsibility, and that is to review the material, a simple, affirmance and remanded it and finally an appeal to this court.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.440" offset="1423709">If the opinion is published, if there is a published opinion in the Appellate Department which is entirely discretionary with them, then the Court of Appeal has the right to exercise its discretion to determine whether or not it wants to decide that question and take jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.999" offset="1513988">Absolutely, as a matter of fact, it is expressly prohibited that you do make such an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.481" offset="1539901">I believe there was a case that came out that said, once your petition for certification is denied in the Appellate Department, you have no right to appeal that or that it is purely discretionary under the court rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="435.441" offset="1815754">To continue, taking this history of the case procedurally, I have the following quote which I picked up from a recent case and that is I entertain more than a mild suspicion however that this is an exercise in futility that the court is merely marching up the hill only to march right down again and it is timely become just a little realistic in the face of a record such as this one, US Vs Tucker decided January 12, this year.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark</label>
            <text syncTime="476.220" offset="1978863">I think that in taking the history of this case if you please, it illustrates the futility of making a decision by this court in the ordinary manner as to whether or not for instance contemporary standards are national or local because it really does not matter, the judges below simply will not pay any attention to the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.498" offset="2091921">They do not rule as a matter of law and obscenity cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.246" offset="2110938">It is a very visceral reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.207" offset="2122745">You get a shock value on obscenity in no other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.241" offset="2142912">They, in my experience do not function and I suggest to the court that the answer to the dilemma which is posed that the paradise, that your reconcilable conflict between the cases is that this court set up a series of rules by which courts must act in obscenity cases and that is that they must for instance prior to initiating a criminal proceeding have the type of hearing on the material which is set for it in Freedman versus Maryland, Blount versus Rizzi and there should be rules whereby they are compelled to either state that it is protected or not protected, so that somewhere along the line before the criminal process starts, the person who is going to be involved in a criminal prosecution will at least have the vaguest idea that what he is trying to purvey or so is not or is within the marketplace and I give you the following example and I say this is why I believe it comes within the context of the certiorari questions because we have here the question national standards or state standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.492" offset="2459934">If we do not have national standards, I think our brief pointed out that in the area of film, in the area of books which cross straight lines, there must be a common standard because otherwise state A can impose unreasonable burdens upon what kinds of films are shown in the motion picture theaters in their neighborhood, perhaps one community, local community or state does not like R films, because R-rated films have sex portrayed in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.534" offset="2596084">Some X-films sometimes have more violence than an R film and less sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.288" offset="2623147">It depends upon the individual idea of the censor himself.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="641.782" offset="2641119">Let me ask you about this administrative process you were just suggesting to be interposed before a criminal proceeding starts.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.274" offset="2675078">So you are suggesting something like the old fashioned board of censorship to take a look at it first and advise the publisher?</text>

          <turn speaker="mark" startTime="660.655" stopTime="801.553">
            <label>Mr. Mark</label>
            <text syncTime="660.655" offset="2716561">I am suggesting a process whereby if there is cause to believe, probable cause to believe that a material which is being sent out or is being sold on the stand is or maybe violative of the penal statute or maybe obscene within the area of the state statute that the judge issues a show cause order and perhaps even a seizure warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.528" offset="2824081">The material has seized, it is brought into court, one day hearing, expert testimony, two days to make a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.004" offset="2857936">The decision should be in writing stating the judge's reasons for believing that the material is or is not protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.892" offset="2889492">At that point, you have some sort of adjudication because the real proposition and problem is with Scienter, Mr. Miller and every other seller of pornography has a justice in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.717" offset="2960858">A judge which says the material is protected in one jurisdiction to no avail in another, because he can not get any recourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.493" offset="2995967">If he goes to a jury trial and gets acquitted, the judge in the next jurisdiction says, well, I do not know what the acquittal was based on, maybe it was just as the jury was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the person who sold it.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.548" offset="3052182">Maybe they were not satisfied with Scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.942" offset="3061691">The criminal process is not equipped to deal with obscenity questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.231" offset="3082902">It never has been and never was.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.152" offset="3090530">There has to be a different type of process dealing in the civil area to deal with the sensitive area of suppression and censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.250" offset="3126997">That is why I suggest for instance that the national standard has to apply, but it has to apply in the area of inter-state commerce, it has to apply also.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.560" offset="3164195">We have a very interesting question, what happens with the Full Faith and Credit Clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="777.165" offset="3182585">If one court says, it is obscene in one state, does not this bind another court under the Full Faith and Credit Clause or if it is obscene, what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="787.383" offset="3223545">Is the man entitled to plead the other judgment in bar as an estoppel or just as a defense in the grounds that he has no scienter, how could I possibly know that it is obscene if a court said it is not obscene.</text>

            <text syncTime="820.338" offset="3355307">The charge was made in the terms of state standards because at the time, there was and still is a case of in re Giannini, which is cited in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.142" offset="3402536">In the Giannini case, our California Supreme Court said in the matter of dancing, topless dancing, they said, at least the standards have to be statewide because there has to be some sort of uniformity, although they felt that you can not cross a dance act between across county borders then obviously the local community should be the best judge, but there at least has to be some uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.335" offset="3519252">Applying that rationale of the Giannini case to motion pictures, books, those magazines that travel across state lines and which seem that the national standard is the only standard which has any reasonable grounds.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark</label>
            <text syncTime="972.109" offset="3962393">Well, it is a very confusing subject because to some judges and I suppose lawyers, it means the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.129" offset="3994471">To me it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.821" offset="3997292">It means an entirely different thing, because being aware of the character of the matter, that's what the new section means, and what the character of the matter is, is a very, very illusive quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.099" offset="4042327">Does it mean that the character is that of a sex, is it the character of violence, is it the character of sadism, sadomasochism, one of the characteristics of pornography, we do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.357" offset="4095408">It is -- probably whatever the jury wants to think it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.747" offset="4120904">One of the big problems that comes up in the prosecution or the trial of the case and the defense of a case is this question of the various and I might say paradoxical rules that this court is set up, because in Roth, court said that briefs, and I am paraphrasing a little bit, paraphrasing, in Roth, the court said that obscenity is not speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.698" offset="4228737">Then, in Stanley versus Georgia, the court said that obscenity is speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.646" offset="4248590">Then in Reidel, the court said we adopt both Rob and Stanley and we do not vary one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.758" offset="4273041">So we come to the unusual proposition that speech is not speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.182" offset="4306687">I adhere perhaps and this is my final argument to the add on theory of constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.912" offset="4337616">It appears that from reading the various cases that if you have the First Amendment protection and you add on for instance the Ninth Amendment, the right to privacy as in Stanley, 1 and 9 equal 14, and you have a constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.224" offset="4402817">In our case, we have a few other add on protections that Mr. Miller should avail in himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.840" offset="4429358">He has the First Amendment protection, he has the Fifth Amendment, which is the res judicata or estoppel, he also has the Ninth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.957" offset="4477841">So in this case, we have 1, 5, and 9, including 14 and he should be able to have a reversal just on that theory of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.008" offset="4510024">Getting back to the more mundane, I say very seriously, we need guidance from the court, this court, and I think it cannot be done in the framework of deciding whether national or local standards applied because the courts below do not know how to apply them even if it is shown to them what it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.007" offset="4582017">They work on a case by case basis and I had one judge said to me, when I pointed out Blount versus Rizzi, he says, that only counts if the defendant's name is Rizzi and the plaintiff's name is Blount, and otherwise it is distinguishable on that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.783" offset="4641054">So set us up some rules, give us some guidance, let's get this type of action out of the criminal area unless there is a distinctive criminal case with knowledge and the type of pre-warning that is generally accepted as a part of Due Process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1406.695" offset="5700790">Initially I would like to attempt to set the records straight in this matter and in the April of 1969, a complaint was filed in the Municipal Court of the Harbor Judicial District for Orange County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.830" offset="5745302">Thereafter on April 16th, 1969 the demurrer was filed by Mr. Marks, the defendant of that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.442" offset="5775709">Thereafter, an amended complaint was filed May 9th, 1969 and following the amended complaint the same demurrer was held to apply to the amended complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.347" offset="5811340">The hearing and the demurrer, under California law is limited to face the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.189" offset="5842687">However, Mr. Marks did introduce expert testimony at that time, expert testimony related to the obscenity of the material in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.484" offset="5899947">That was not controverted by the prosecution simply because on demurrer, no evidence can be taken, the inquiry is limited to the face of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.369" offset="5939444">Thereafter there was an appeal to the Appellate Department in the Superior Court in Orange County, and the denial of demurrer was sustained.</text>

            <text syncTime="2159.141" offset="8710514">As Justice Harlan indicated, that's readily apparent from the language of the two amendments themselves, the first provides Congress shall make no law and obviously, we can't apply that in its precise terms through the state through the Fourth Amendment because Congress doesn't exist in this state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2330.101" offset="9394399">The inquiry should be whether or not the state action so subverts the fundamental liberties implicit in the Due Process clause that it cannot be sustained as a rational exercise of power and I would submit that adoption by state of a local or statewide standards for limits of candor as a portion of the definition of obscenity is not subversive of fundamental liberties, but is actually a rational exercise of power, whether -- I would suggest that neither practicality, reason or the constitution require a national standard for customary limits of candor as suggested by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.354" offset="9583421">Initially, I would suggest that practicality demands that something other than a national standard be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.241" offset="9606932">How is a national standard to be determined fully apart from the legal question, the mixed question of constitutional fact law, as a matter of fact presented to the jury, how is a national standard to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.279" offset="9683105">Well, as far as that factual determination, I would assume that experts could testify, however in this case, an expert testified as to the statewide standard, an expert who is employee of the Los Angeles Police Department, took him 30 days to conduct his survey analysis of the state and five years on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.441" offset="9759696">Say, if Los Angeles now charges $400 a day, every time another experts goes outside the city limits to testify to recoup the cost of conducting their survey and updating their survey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.898" offset="9813508">Can you imagine the additional cost that would be involved that that expert had to spend 30 days traveling each of the 50 states, why we're taking 50 months just to complete a survey?</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.148" offset="9862514">Long before he completed the survey, he would have to update it because it requires contemporary community standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.158" offset="9890621">So if we multiply the cost by 50 times 400 and a time, 50 times a month, totally impossible and impractical.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.205" offset="9934821">Now I'm not suggesting that cost to loan is a factor that should cause us to overlook any constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.255" offset="9974945">I'm simply suggesting constitution itself does not require experts and it's impractical, impractical to prove through experts a national standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.264" offset="10023010">Reason also requires that a local standard, local state standard be adapted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.069" offset="10058223">Obviously, one local area will accept material that another local area will not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.882" offset="10089465">A national standard who very likely prevents a local community that had liberal attitude and would accept material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.447" offset="10135754">From receiving that material, because of the restrict of influence of a conservative community some 2500 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.424" offset="10179640">And the opposite is also true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.062" offset="10190194">The conservative community would be forced to accept material because of a nationwide standard that is diluted by a more liberal standard of a community again, 2500 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.651" offset="10248603">Thus adoption of a national standard would have just the effect that the appellant in this case and in the amici are suggesting as undesirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.017" offset="10282040">It would have the result of making this all one, making this all little thin soldiers out of a mold, all receiving the same material, the same standard and would not provide for differences from one community to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.333" offset="10339301">We suggest additionally that the constitution supports a state or local community standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.822" offset="10365214">Initially in Roth, this court used the term community and inspite of the dictionary definition, that's in the footnote 2 to Jacobellis suggest that the customary meaning of the community is a local community, the area in which people shop, work, live and entertain themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.449" offset="10451732">I think that definition of community is also consistent with the same paragraph of the dictionary referred to in that footnote of Jacobellis which defines community as society as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.601" offset="10508365">Additionally, it's constitutionally permissible to accept that local or statewide standard because of the definition announced in Roth, that the community standard must be contemporary with the times, without that term contemporary we would be stuck, I would assume with the same definition of obscenity that existed in 1791 when the First Amendment was adopted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2853.188" offset="11486703">Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I believe that it would relieve this court and appellate courts from determining that which they are not really capable of determining on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.620" offset="11536440">The constitutional fact law of question, it would eliminate that for consideration and would permit us to rely on the jury verdict and assuming there was a conviction, a substandard -- sufficient evidence test to determine whether or not it complied with Due Process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.802" offset="11613136">I think the changing standard from one geographical location to another, again, has constitutional background, simply because we do have the one variable as I was suggesting, the contemporary community standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.071" offset="11670292">It's a changing standard and it must be a standard that's contemporary with our time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.551" offset="11696205">So why is it so inconsistent to say we have another variable?</text>

            <text syncTime="2927.370" offset="11783454">Fire in a crowded theater is punishable and in open field it's not, the words are the same, it's the location that constitutes a clear and present danger and maybe that's what we're saying in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.841" offset="11833296">If one community can consider matter which violates its particular standard for limits of candor, dangerous and within its police power and yet another community, really one is so considerate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.527" offset="11888048">The adapting this test, the appellate courts would then use the sufficient evidence test to review convictions and the time saved building into other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.982" offset="11949906">In other, whichever test is used in a particular case, I would suggest that the judgment should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.400" offset="11987523">If we use a national standard, I would suggest that the statewide standard in the State of California is a liberal standard, and in effect had -- as a net effect of requiring that the prosecution a greater burden of proof than the national standard had, in fact, been established and could be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.282" offset="12075085">The statewide standard, that was what has done in this case and if it's a local standard, again, it operated to the benefit of the appellant to use a state standard because the statewide standard, I would submit for the State of California, is again somewhat more liberal than a conservative standard of Orange County and again required a prosecution, a greater burden of proof.</text>
