            <label>Mr. C. Michael Abbott</label>
            <text syncTime="60.880" offset="243461">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.075" offset="252238">And may Your Honor, I would like to reserve five minutes of my time for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.868" offset="271464">The nature of the case before the Court now is a challenge to the Florida prejudgment replevin statute on procedural due process and Fourth Amendments search and seizure grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.201" offset="308767">The issues are two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.919" offset="315664">Simply stated, whether the Florida prejudgment replevin procedure in which a writ is issued without notice or prior hearing violates the procedural due process and the Fourteenth Amendment and sectioning whether the same procedure insofar that commands the state officer to enter a private ruling by force if necessary violates the search and seizure provisions the Fourth Amendment as applied to the States to the Fourteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.988" offset="403853">The lower court held with one judge dissenting that the Florida prejudgment replevin statutes were constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.807" offset="431125">The facts of the case can be briefly stated, the appellant Margarita Fuentes separately purchased a stove and a stereo from the appellee Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in 1967 under retained title contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.824" offset="487236">These contracts were then consolidated into one agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.541" offset="506149">Margarita Fuentes has complained to Firestone on a number of occasions about mechanical difficulties with her stove.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.431" offset="533629">Appellee Firestone indicates that those difficulties have been repaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.809" offset="555154">Margarita Fuentes alleges that they have not.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.910" offset="567589">For that reason she began withholding payments on her contract on April of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.081" offset="588278">In May of that year Firestone sent her telegram for repossession.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.032" offset="612101">Four-and-a-half months later, on September 15, they filed an affidavit and a bond pursuant to the Florida statute in replevin to her property.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.415" offset="649613">The execution writ was executed on the same day on September 15 by Deputy Sheriff of Dade County over her protest and a protest of her relatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.837" offset="691304">The appellant then filed the instant action in the court below in November, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.621" offset="714397">The Dade County Small Claims Court on our motion agreed to state that action pursuant to the conclusion of this action and on August 24, a Three-Judge Court below held that neither of the -- that this statutory procedure did not violate either the Fourth or Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.700" offset="790779">Now with regards to the issue of procedural due process, our position can be stated very simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.542" offset="814080">If you look over the breadth of the due process cases that had come before this Court, conceding that it is a flexible concept, nevertheless, one rule has emerged that is that absent special circumstances involving a compelling governmental interest, that no one may be deprived of a significant property interest prior to having a chance to contest the taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.835" offset="895269">That is what this Court said in Sniadach and reaffirmed it in Boddie versus Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.508" offset="910002">Mr. Justice Brennan said again in Bell versus Burson.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.796" offset="923167">Now if you look at the Florida procedure, usually an affidavit is filed, although it is not now required in the Florida statue but was filed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.764" offset="955037">It is the usual procedure to file an affidavit in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.737" offset="966844">The claimant is lawfully entitled to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.482" offset="977920">That is the only allegation that you must make.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.856" offset="987324">He files a complaint, a bond in double the value of the property and the clerk issues the writ without any judicial interposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.408" offset="1017626">Simply a ministerial act, he issues the writ, while notes in a hearing, he gives it to the sheriff, sheriff takes it the home and executes on a property.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="263.018" offset="1052003">He files a bond in double the amount of the value of the property?</text>

          <turn speaker="c_michael_abbott" startTime="266.306" stopTime="267.380">
            <label>Mr. C. Michael Abbott</label>
            <text syncTime="266.306" offset="1065169">That is correct Your Honor.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="267.380" stopTime="271.010">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="267.380" offset="1069453">And he is the one who asserts the value of the property?</text>

            <label>Mr. C. Michael Abbott</label>
            <text syncTime="271.010" offset="1083977">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.578" offset="1090247">And there is no examination whether this is true or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.931" offset="1103621">Now we submit that the Florida procedure displays the same types of constitutional deficiencies that this Court file lacking is Sniadach versus Family Finance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.869" offset="1143432">There is no evidence indicating the validity or the probability of the claim prior to the part of the taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.281" offset="1169032">The statute is not nearly drawn to certain circumstances that maybe have extreme interest to the creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.452" offset="1189721">There is no need for the credit to allege a particular state interest that is of concern to him, and it is the use of the property here as it was in Sniadach, it is of concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.537" offset="1230054">It is use of the property itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.362" offset="1237368">There is a property under the Fourteenth Amendment we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.868" offset="1251370">I mean in fact the contract between Margarita Fuentes and Firestone Stores is simply this that she said, I will pay you more money than the cash price of these goods over period of time, in order that I might have the goods immediately as exactly what I am paying for, I am paying for the use of those goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.839" offset="1311347">I agree you to pay you a finance charge so that I may have them now.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.410" offset="1325558">And it is the use of the goods that she is entitled to until she defaults.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.907" offset="1347605">But here under this procedure there is no need for Firestone to prove that she has in fact default in this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.282" offset="1369025">They come and get it anytime they think they want it back for whatever reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="358.266" offset="1432973">She can thereafter reach that bond and collect on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.993" offset="1451886">Of course, the bond has nothing to establish the validity of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.348" offset="1465365">The bond does nothing to mitigate the deprivation between the taking of the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="382.697" offset="1530776">I mean there is no indication of the claim itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.785" offset="1539135">Nobody makes the examination of whether there is or there is not a default.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.173" offset="1548643">One can argue that by filing a bond, you cannot deter privilege claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.111" offset="1564421">That if one has to file bond you will deter those people who do not have a proper claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.545" offset="1586155">Did Firestone have to file anything in Court prior to taking the goods that in any way indicated that there was a default?</text>

          <turn speaker="c_michael_abbott" startTime="405.555" stopTime="414.375">

            <text syncTime="405.555" offset="1622204">No, all they have to file is something in the case they are lawfully entitled to, not to the extent one brief that as anything default.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.671" offset="1646655">I suppose yes, but there is no examination.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="414.375" offset="1657417">What is the condition of the bond though that if Firestone does not prove what?</text>

            <label>Mr. C. Michael Abbott</label>
            <text syncTime="419.159" offset="1676539">If Firestone then does not prove at the this comes to trial that they are lawfully entitled to it, Mrs. Fuentes raised defenses that show that Firestone is not, then if she can show damages she can reach the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.261" offset="1720947">But in the first instance they have to show nothing, all they have to do is file an affidavit that is all pre written and said, I am lawfully entitled to property.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.943" offset="1759713">It seems to me that what we have to focus on this case are what are the state interests here that are compelling that require Firestone to need this kind of summary procedure.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="451.680" offset="1806629">Well, is it possible that the perishable nature of the merchandise and fact that it is rather rapidly wasting asset has something to do with that?</text>

            <text syncTime="464.634" offset="1858456">If they could show that, then I think that might be significant Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.875" offset="1867442">In fact, it is interesting to note here, that in April when she withheld her first payment they sent her a notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.506" offset="1890011">In May they sent a telegram saying, we are going to repossess within 24 hours if you do not start paying.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.826" offset="1907252">Then they waited for four-and-a-half months before they actually issued the writ.</text>

            <label>Mr. C. Michael Abbott</label>
            <text syncTime="482.392" offset="1929509">No, the only point I am trying to make is that if they are actually interested in getting the property because of the deteriorating value, why then did they wait this length of time before going after it.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.242" offset="1968901">I think what they really want is they want the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.404" offset="1977574">By taking the property first, they gained an additional bit of leverage over that period of time to try to coerce her to pay whether she may have all defenses or not, I think that is the point to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.900" offset="2019579">It seems to me though that if one looks at the interest that the appellees before, it is compelling this procedure, there is simply no indication that it is necessary for them to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.270" offset="2069002">The State of Florida says that it is the protection of property of Florida citizens that is of compelling interest here.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.934" offset="2091677">But of course our position would be there emphasizing the rights of one class such as creditors over another class such as debtors.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.041" offset="2128144">They also say, well, it is the economic life of the community that is at stake here.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.180" offset="2148624">As a matter of fact though there is no evidence at all indicating that there is any relationship between attachment type remedies and the availability of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.861" offset="2183419">The California Supreme Court was recently faced with the same issue just last month in Randone versus Appellate Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.085" offset="2204317">They reject and they said, there is no evidence here that there is any relationship between attachment of property like this and the availability of credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.660" offset="2234619">And further, we note that there are some prevalent studies that indicate that there is no relationship between these two factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.607" offset="2262413">So, if in fact Firestone is restricted, what is going to happen?</text>
            <text syncTime="568.678" offset="2274638">Well, the only evidence before this Court indicating that there is going to be any damage to Firestone at all, it is an affidavit by Firestone’s own national manager of retail credit in Akron, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.468" offset="2313822">The lower court re-indicated the counter affidavit by Professor William F. Willauer (ph) of the National Consumer Law Center in Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.201" offset="2340780">We did not even submit that to the record on this Court because we do not feel that either of these affidavits gives the Court the kind of hard data on which you could comfortably rely and say yes, in fact, there is gong to be an economic depravation to elect the community here.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.481" offset="2393861">But let us go one step further.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.791" offset="2399086">Let us assume that replevin is essential to consumer credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.837" offset="2419252">It seems to me that one can make the argument that to the extent that you give debtors or creditors relatively inexpensive and expeditious remedies such as we have here, to that extent, they just encourage them to over extend.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.750" offset="2462929">I mean maybe they are giving credit to people that should not have credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.527" offset="2474005">Now is that in the interest of the citizens of Florida?</text>
            <text syncTime="621.067" offset="2484245">I do not think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.247" offset="2488947">Our research shows that one out of five people simply default on this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.932" offset="2503680">They just never show up once their property is taken, they think it is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.826" offset="2515278">I think that is significant one of the every five people.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.707" offset="2526772">I suspect that is low over the national average, I suspect it is much higher, and then if you look that studies of Dr. Castlewich (ph) who has mentioned this morning (Inaudible) find you will that nationally that the default rate is much higher but in Florida every one out of five.</text>

            <text syncTime="774.710" offset="3098749">The whole point that we make that there is no evidence indicating that a large number of that is expect, what Firestone says, in their own brief at page 18, they say, in the vast majority of these cases, and that is their language not mine, in the vast majority of this case statute that is voluntarily relinquished the property, give it up freely.</text>

            <text syncTime="803.603" offset="3214315">I mean, we are talking about a very narrow portion of the total consumer contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.788" offset="3235109">And there is no evident even indicating that small portion.</text>

            <text syncTime="821.293" offset="3285159">I mean, Firestone just like any other creditor begins to go to this debt collection process once they think there is a default.</text>

            <text syncTime="904.868" offset="3619422">But these are sometimes very complex issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.103" offset="3628408">If you take a look at the brief of National Consumer Law Center, one of the things that is interesting in this case that it is here that the security interest that Firestone had in the stove had expired at the time they got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.394" offset="3669473">That is to say that in any rational allocation of payments between the stereo and the stove, Mrs. Fuentes had paid off that stove when they came and took it.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.537" offset="3702073">And, that is not, not a type of defense that the judge looking at the contract, see.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.017" offset="3724016">She has got to have a chance to commend and say you know, I paid for that stove already, Firestone has breached their warranty of repair.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.925" offset="3751602">A judge just by himself not makes that kind of determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.902" offset="3775530">Finally it seems to me, I would like to look briefly at the Fourth Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.297" offset="3793084">Under the Florida procedure, the writ commanded the officer, state officer, the Deputy Sheriff in our case, to enter by force if necessary and to make a reasonable exploration of the dwelling in order to find the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.762" offset="3847001">The problem we have with that is again, what is the compelling state interest that Firestone has in allowing the Deputy Sheriff not only to enter but to enter by force if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.709" offset="3882736">Now, if you look at the balancing test which this Court has done in the past, it seems to me you have to weigh the interest of Firestone against the invasion which that entails, and if we agree with Mr. Justice White said in Camara that you are going to have as much of a disturbance in a civil seizure as you are in criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.799" offset="3947102">It seems to me that you have to allege a very substantial state interest before you can go in to that home.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.243" offset="3968940">Again, the statute is not nearly drawn, there is no advance notice that they are coming here, I think it appears in with Wyman versus James, resistance with misdemeanor compares to Mr. Wyman where if the welfare is different, wanted to refuse she could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.737" offset="4022857">There is no way to refuse here; the sheriff is going to go in whether you refuse or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.153" offset="4036545">If you look at the back of this case Margarita Fuentes did everything, one could expect of a private citizen to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.972" offset="4059847">Short of actually physically obstructing the sheriff, she told him, she stopped him at the door, she called her son-in-law, the son of son-in-law who speaks English which she does not, explained to the Sheriff that he could not take the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.711" offset="4114808">The sheriff comes back and says I have got to take your property that it is my obligation; only at that point did she let him enter the house.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.834" offset="6187259">I mean, one of the things they said is it seems to them that Firestone, that Mrs. Fuentes may have wage her rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.402" offset="6225607">It is a little unclear from the opinion but it appears that they are saying that since the contract reads that in the event of default of any payments, since Mrs. Fuentes has admitted that she withheld payments, therefore, that gives Firestone the right to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.411" offset="6285584">I think that is an incorrect assertion of Florida Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.708" offset="6306795">Our whole position during the whole litigation has been that ‘default’ is a technical word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.835" offset="6327275">Default indicates breach of legal obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.873" offset="6339396">Now, if Firestone has breached the warranty as she says they have, under the Uniform Commercial Code in Florida, she has a right to suspend her payments; that is her right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.489" offset="6377953">Therefore, she has a right to suspend payments, she cannot be in default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.177" offset="6396656">If the contracts said, in the event of an omission of payment, Firestone is entitled to repossession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.504" offset="6421943">Then they would have a stronger case, but it did not say that, it says in the event of default in payment, there can be no default unless one proves that there is a technical default and that has not been proved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.843" offset="6463321">Likewise, the court below said that we are here dealing with a peaceable entry into her home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.905" offset="6487562">It seems to me that with due difference to the lower court that is misleading, I think the question has to be asked, are we dealing with an entry that is coerced?</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.897" offset="6519536">And did Mrs. Fuentes say, Sheriff come on in and take my property, it is alright, or did she stop them at the door and say you cannot have it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2004.451" offset="8017711">From then on it is before the Court and no disposition of the case can be held without the Court doing something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.277" offset="8045087">I think there is a very real interest in the conservation of judicial time and energy to be held in the statute envisions, and that it would take a great deal of judicial time and energy for a party to come before the Court of competent jurisdiction to get the writ of replevy, especially as Mr. Abbott says in an advisory hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.572" offset="8162220">Certainly that would consume even more time than the ex parte type of hearing suggested about the Court in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.157" offset="8196598">And I think the State of Florida does have a very appropriate interest in preserving the economic viability of the installment credit system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.777" offset="8235050">So, they really, State of Florida sees two major concepts involved here one is, the very basic underlying question that the State posts and that is our right to legislate in this statutory scheme of replevin, a writ is over 700 years old and somehow the appellant would have you believe that the viability and vitality of the writ of replevin somehow ended when the Deputy Sheriff stepped on the front porch of Mrs. Fuentes’ house.</text>

            <text syncTime="2180.473" offset="8721868">This is purely and simply our statutory replevin action that we are seeking to defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.761" offset="8751020">I think there is another fair amount in overriding issue that it is before the Court and that is just how far reaching is the doctrine of Sniadach or Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.590" offset="8806296">I think the appellant in this case tries to view and characterized this case in a vacuum, separately in a part from its operative facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.550" offset="8842136">The facts are that Firestone, under our replevin statute and under its contract, had an absolute right to possess the exact same specific property that they then engrafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.586" offset="8894276">It does not sound ethereal or abstract right of judgment that they are seeking to execute on and therefore garnish Mrs. Sniadach’s wages or stop Mr. Kelly’s welfare payments, those things that are peculiar type of property, those things that are needed for the life blood of a family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.161" offset="8992601">But, the appellant speaks here in conclusionary terms without any real facts to support those conclusions, he is speaking this case is one of abstraction really in regard to Mrs. Fuentes because the factual basis is one that wholly supports the reasonableness and the rationality of the Florida statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.638" offset="9094478">It was a peaceful repossession she has all the defenses available to her at the time and place when they reasonably can be presented and the appellant here would have this Court engraft on our law exactly what this Court has said it will not do at many times and that is make due process of law of some fix mechanistic principles without regard to the facts under which it is operating in a given case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.619" offset="9202416">And I believe the attack on the Florida statute is a very broad brush treatment of storm and fury that really in a real sense attacks the very system of which Mrs. Fuentes is at beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.806" offset="9271171">Because the system is orderly, it has a great deal rationality to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.322" offset="9297189">She, Mrs. Fuentes, upon repossession could have a quick hearing on the merits, she could post the bond, and also if this statute were abused at the hearing and she laid the predicate to establish the abuse of the procedure, she has her civil recourses to misuse of process, the civil actions for harassing predator techniques and tactics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.163" offset="9420591">She could take Firestone in the Court and get damages from them for this harassment and for misuse of process if she could establish that this was indeed the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.065" offset="9472209">So, the fact that the statute has not been abused, speaks of its rationality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.251" offset="9496973">And, I think also the fact that people know when they buy something on an installment basis that they are obliged to pay for it and they know that if they do not pay for it, it is going to be taken back rather by the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.923" offset="9551621">So Mrs. Fuentes is not in a precarious position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.753" offset="9574922">Indeed, the record shows that she had been a credit and installment purchaser of this very same Firestone Store several times before over period of years, she had established a credit rating with them, and that if she really have some defense to raise as to breach of warranty, the place to do it was before the court in a proper manner, in a proper case, and the forum was there for her to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.478" offset="9681816">Certainly, Mrs. Sniadach’s wages cannot be made analogous to Mrs. Fuentes stereo set.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.792" offset="9715148">Mrs. Sniadach’s wages were the life blood of her family, they were that suppose this Court specialized type of property presenting distinct problems in our society, without Mrs. Sniadach’s wages her family could not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.426" offset="9765616">Without Mr. Kelly’s welfare payments being cutoff his family could not have existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.872" offset="9791425">Money represent those things that is a specialized type of property, certainly one cannot say that a stereo set and unused electric range sitting out on the back porch of a home are those specialized type of property.</text>

            <text syncTime="2553.050" offset="10212101">Your Honor, the State of Florida says that if you do not, if you do not what this Court would be doing would be deciding replevin cases add in for (Inaudible) as to precise property, which property does come under Sniadach and Kelly and which property does not in a case to case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.273" offset="10321084">The operative facts, I think in summary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.103" offset="10328398">The operative facts show that the state’s interest is to get the debtor and the creditor, and at this process, which is set up by the Florida statutes does need those rudimentary standards to fairness and due process that have been so often enunciated by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.418" offset="10401646">And that to change the Florida Statute’s in effect would be to throw a monkey range into the works of an orderly state process and an economic process in which both parties are eminently aware of their rights and duties.</text>

            <text syncTime="2628.717" offset="10514808">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.812" offset="10531213">Before proceeding to discuss the appellant’s due process complaints as they relate to this case, I would like to clarify one or two matters that have been here before discussed by counsel for appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.051" offset="10596101">He has asserted in argument before the Court that there were complaints about the performance of the stove in question, and has asserted here in all argument that that was the reason for Mrs. Fuentes withholding payment on the installment contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.808" offset="10671229">When we were requested by the Three-Judge Federal Court below to confer it for the purpose of stipulating to as many facts as we could to ease the burden of that Court in resolving this case, Mr. Abbott, counsel for the plaintiff asserted and it reflected in this stipulation that he made a contention that there was some difficulty with the stove and that his client was not satisfied with the repairs that were made by Firestone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.359" offset="10793378">Because of the fact that such assertion was made by counsel in that stipulation, the Three-Judge Federal Court below set down an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of allowing either or both parties to this cause to adduce before that Court evidence on any matters on which they may not be able to be stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.751" offset="10882926">At that evidentiary hearing despite inquiry by that Court of Mr. Abbott, he declined to adduce any evidence to support his unsupported contentions that the stove was in fact defective or have not been properly repaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.868" offset="10947396">There is nothing in this record to reflect in one order that the reason for Mrs. Fuentes withholding payment for the stove or for the merchandise purchase was because of a defect or a failure to properly repair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.709" offset="11010821">The next point I would like to mention in respect to a factual statement and that is as to the Fourth Amendment contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.699" offset="11038720">Counsel for appellate implies and has throughout his brief implied that there may have been some forcible entry in the service of the particular replevin writ here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.770" offset="11086994">That is a far cry from the undisputed facts here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.352" offset="11105384">Not only was a peaceable repossession, the Deputy himself was invited in to the Fuentes home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.258" offset="11132970">There is only a dispute as to the time of the invitation of the Deputy into the home but there is no dispute and it is conceded that prior to the actual service of the writ, the Deputy was invited in to the Fuentes home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.089" offset="11192320">There was no objection by Mrs. Fuentes herself; there was a question raised by her daughter-in-law, who happened to be in the home with her about the right of the sheriff to repossess the merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.397" offset="11237564">The sheriff awaited the daughter-in-law’s call to Mrs. Fuentes’ son-in-law who then sought the advice of counsel and the sheriff stood there during this period of time which must have been some 30 minutes or so when all of these was going on and the son-in-law came to the home and advice the sheriff that he had talked with his counsel and that his counsel said he could not take back merchandise unless there was an actual court proceeding pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.117" offset="11348428">At which point, of course the deputy explained that there was a Court proceeding pending at which point all parties involved retracted and failed to raise any objection to the repossession of the merchandise.</text>

            <text syncTime="2920.931" offset="11683631">I think he has referenced to the fact he filed an affidavit in the court below to the fact that, I think most of the practice or the practice of most bonding companies in Florida require the defendants who post forth coming bonds to actually collateralize the bond by putting up the value of the bond itself as security where they apparently do not require full collateralization of the replevin bond itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2954.941" offset="11819677">If there are abuses in the bonding company’s procedures or charges we of course would submit that would be matter for legislative direction and not for a constitutional strike down of this statute on the basis of the Fourth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.810" offset="11879236">I would like to mention the fact that in our brief before this Court we have dealt somewhat with the economic aspects of the secured sales transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.993" offset="11927928">Our purpose in doing so is not because I purport to be an expert in the field of economics which is somewhat a complicated field, but to point out I think significantly that the property interest in the collateral sale, collateral which forms subject matter of the installment sale, is vitally different from those involved in wage garnishments which were involved in Sniadach and welfare termination payments which were involved in the Goldberg-Kelly case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.419" offset="12045584">And secondly, because the impact of altering or in fact eliminating some repossession remedies is conceivably so great that it should not be done by constitutional sweeping, constitutional attacks upon a long acquiesced in and honored remedy such as replevin certainly in absence of compelling judicial precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.766" offset="12138998">We submit that there is no compelling judicial precedent of this Court that would require a constitutional strike down of this statute on the basis of due process contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.587" offset="12182256">The times when this Court has had before, the question and the validity of the remedies or prejudgment attachments generally such as in McKay against McInnes, this Court has approved them and only in Sniadach has the Court disapproved any prejudgment attachment remedy or general attachment remedy and that of course dealt with the question of garnishment. The basis there being of course as Mr. Schwartz has emphasized that involved as the Court stated a specialize type of property wages in which the Court has describe there and in Goldberg as the very means by which to live.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.659" offset="12338573">Both in the economic and legal aspects of the secured sales transaction we submit bear consideration in considering the due process contentions asserted here by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.435" offset="12389669">The respected property rights of course of the secured seller and purchaser are vitality different from those involved in a prejudgment garnishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.374" offset="12421433">For example, family finance has no contractual interest or legal interest in the wages of Mrs. Sniadach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.054" offset="12452153">It has none certainly until after judgment is entered upon the debt if there be a judgment ever entered upon a debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.070" offset="12480261">Of course, there is no contractual relationship involved in the Goldberg situation, but in the secured sales transaction there is a contractual relationship involved which gives the creditor, we submit, certainly and equally if not greater property right in the collateral as the debtor, and it is for the protection of the creditor and the debtor that replevin remedies have been approved, have been enacted, and have been followed, and have been acquiesced in for centuries of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3184.369" offset="12737411">We have adduced in our brief and appendix to our brief, statistics reflecting in so many instances that for -- particularly in automobiles for example that for the greater proportion of the ordinary automobile, the term of the automobile loan that the value of the collateral itself or the resale value of the collateral itself is much less than the balance owed on the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.741" offset="12842945">For example, if I recall correctly and if it is reflected in our brief that on a 36-month automobile loan that for the first 22 months, the wholesale or resale value of the automobile is less than the balance due on the 36-month loan debt.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.341" offset="12909296">Now, there are two reasons for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.028" offset="12916088">One is the fast appreciation on automobile in the first few months in its life and the other is that for the first few months the buyer is paying mostly interest and almost no principle, is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="3240.128" offset="12960496">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.998" offset="12963944">I would assume that if the contract provide the course that interest is being -- payments are being applied first to interest and then the principal which I trust is probably case in most such transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.068" offset="13016189">We submit further that the Sniadach situation or Sniadach ruling should not be extended to all types of tangible personal property and to the replevin of the counsel for appellate would here assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.088" offset="13068330">Indeed, I think that this Court expressly recognized in Sniadach that it was not intended to extend its doctrine to all of prejudgment attachments in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.901" offset="13119530">The Court stated there that a procedural rule that may suit due process or satisfy due process or attachments in general citing its prior decision in the McKay versus McInnes which upheld on due process claims constitutionality of prejudgment attachments statutes of Maine does not necessarily satisfy procedural due process in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.313" offset="13209182">And every case in Sniadach involved of course the specialized type of property that the Court recognized warranted a specific conclusion breached in that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.149" offset="13256516">The same holds true in an essence we submit for the Court’s holding in the Goldberg decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.389" offset="13281489">The new property concept there recognized as embracing those dependent upon the sovereign for their very existence, that is the persons being all welfare and when they are deprived of their welfare payments, they are denied of their very means by which to live, we submit is peculiar to that situation and should not be extended to cover the situation of replevy of all types of tangible personal property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3354.596" offset="13418371">Bell and Burson, if my memory assures me correctly Mr. Justice Brennan involves of course the situation of the driver’s license of the Georgia Minister.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.106" offset="13472392">My understanding or reading of the Bell and Burson decision was essentially based on the entitlement concept that this Court recognized in Goldberg that once the government undertakes to give you something even though they are not obliged to give you something then that person has acquired such a property right in that entitlement that he should have an opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.013" offset="13568000">Of course, in Bell and Burson there was a provision for hearing but not on the question of liability of fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.606" offset="13594331">But I think that Bell and Burson were closely fits the specialized situation in Goldberg because the Court did observe in Bell and Burson, if my memory serves me correctly, that the driver’s license himself might well constitute the very means by which to live virtually speaking as or analogous to the Goldberg-Kelly situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.798" offset="13683148">Certainly, we submit that that cannot be applied categorically to all types of tangible personal and it should not be implied to a tangible person be at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.130" offset="13724421">I think there is one interesting statistics that we have cited in our brief from a publication often cited by the appellants themselves in their brief, entitled “The Poor Pay More”, and it demonstrates that people, while they may not be able to do without wages, can do without things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.687" offset="13798713">The statistics show that insofar as consumer durable goods including such things as washing machines, furniture, carpeting, sawing machines that in families earning a annual income of less than $3,000.00 almost anywhere from 30 to 40% of those families, and this Court’s -- there is a sampling, it is about 300 families sampling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.588" offset="13906338">But, it reflects that of the family sample, the 300 family sample earning $3,000.00 annually or less that who have these particular items the washing machine, the TV, the sawing machines and so forth that they had paid cash for them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3612.756" offset="14450939">What happened is that Mrs. Fuentes allowed the sheriff to enter after he had made clear his position that he has the obligation to execute the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.030" offset="14488033">She did not say you come on in to my home to say that he was actually invited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.289" offset="14505064">I think what happened was he, Mrs. Fuentes acquiesced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.550" offset="14518126">In fact Mr. Leon (ph) acquiesced in speaking for Mrs. Fuentes who does not speak English.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.743" offset="14534949">But one thing I did want to note is that both the lower court in our own brief made an error in indicating that Mrs. Delgado called the son-in-law to come to the house because Firestone continues to contend that Mrs. Fuentes herself made no protest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3656.779" offset="14627109">The Firestone contends that Mrs. Fuentes did not make any objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.565" offset="14642260">The only point I want to make is that the record on Page 28 would show that actually Mrs. Fuentes who called Mr. Leon and not her daughter-in-law and the lower court in their own brief including lower court were in error on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.627" offset="14698475">The only point I want to emphasize is to say as Mr. Wright does that they have more property right than Mrs. Fuentes has or she gets more property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.559" offset="14730136">The Firestone has I think missed the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.177" offset="14740689">My whole point has been that what Mrs. Fuentes was paying for is the use of these goods and that is why she pays a higher price in the cash sale price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.881" offset="14775484">In fact, we can show in this case I think, that they did not have any security interest in the stove at all when they took, I do not think that is particularly important I think the situation would be exactly the same if she had made only one payment at the time they came to take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.847" offset="14827311">That they have security interest in both items.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.776" offset="14839014">The point to be made is that she is paying more for this so that she can have their use immediately.</text>

            <text syncTime="3724.289" offset="14897110">But of course Uniform Commercial Code and Florida says that our situation in which she has a right to suspend payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.442" offset="14917695">That is crux of our thrust, and it seems to me that Firestone ought to establish that she has violated or is someone in default.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.213" offset="14952803">I mean, if the Florida gives her a right to suspend payments, is it then fair to give Firestone a right to take their property before they prove they are entitled to it, and that is our thrust.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.553" offset="15002122">It seems to me to the extent that the appellee’s rest on the specialized property that they are ignoring the vast history that the due process cases in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.028" offset="15032111">This Court has always looked first to the state interest involved and then if there is a compelling state interest they look to see whether the property is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.482" offset="15069832">Here, the very little talk coming from the appellees on the significance of the interest on why they need this procedure, why is it compelling that they have, what interest did they show that they needed or as required that they are going to settle without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.070" offset="15128242">They just have not shown that and that is the thrust of the past case in this Court, you look first to the State interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3811.736" offset="15246942">That is right, if you look to the cases -- Mr. Justice Stewart, if you look at the case that have decided is Sniadach, all of those cases have a compelling state interest except for two, Ownbey versus Morgan and McInnes versus McKay about which Mr. Wright speaks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.712" offset="15302844">Now those two cases at least Ownbey is clear involve a non-resident defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.022" offset="15324056">So, they needed that kind of prejudgment attachment in order to bring them into Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.856" offset="15339416">McInnes versus McKay which is the per curiam decision appears to indicate that also there was non-resident defendant there too to extent the Court speaks of the defendant of making a special appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.714" offset="15382779">Those are the only two cases cited by the Court in Sniadach in which there is not a compelling state interest in terms of the statute at hand in which a private creditor initiated procedure to only two cases, and both of those cases are distinguishable and that you needed the statute in order to bring that defense in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.283" offset="15461042">All the rest of those cases involve compelling state interest.</text>
