            <text syncTime="1940.551" offset="7835859">We could speculate for a long time on many things that could occur and yet it occurs to me that if Bruton is to mean anything, it has to mean that when you deprive a man of a situation in a joint a trial where you cannot cross-examine an individual, then you have done something to him which he can't possibly avoid even by a jury instruction, which by the way we understand are a little less than compelling in most instances and that's why you reach your conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.773" offset="7948812">But in the last analysis, when the Court got what it did from you on remand, it occurs to me that they treated it as it should be treated, a disaster as to Snell, and really nothing as to Schneble because there was no connection between anything that he said and the crime which involved Schneble or indeed himself and I think that the matter either should be sent back as improvidently granted or affirmed as is.</text>

            <text syncTime="2069.393" offset="8351203">Did he later stated where each of these people had been riding, that was Lieutenant Yates question.</text>

            <text syncTime="2095.313" offset="8454961">Yes sir, Lieutenant Yates used the name Schneble as – quoting Snell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.761" offset="8492682">Mr. Georgieff indicated that in Schneble's confession, he never admitted he was in the back seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.795" offset="8524865">But on page 280 of the transcript you will find that he did admit that he was in the back seat and he answer to a question, after they went for a walk on the beach talking about Snell and to the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.243" offset="8578677">He said, they came down the road and when they stopped, Snell dropped the plastic cord into his lap and motioned with his hand and he said at that point, he put the cord around her neck and started to squeeze.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.718" offset="8620577">Now I have got the impression, down the road in the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.100" offset="8638027">He said, he pulled as hard as he could and held as long as he could, but she was a good fat woman and gave out and he relaxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.602" offset="8664045">So, I feel like there is other places in the testimony where Schneble admitted he was in the back seat, but that points out for the purpose of argument what I am trying to show you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.308" offset="8710961">Now I would further say that the corroboration of the defendant Snell's testimony is the main trust of this Bruton argument in this case, that I am here on today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.080" offset="8769998">Not yet these two things that I have pointed out to you, but the whole bit from start to finish, the testimony of the trooper, the testimony of the FBI agent Kellogg where he is quoting Snell -- trooper Maddock is quoting Snell, Lieutenant Yates is quoting Snell, all of these things corroborate the testimony, the confession that's given by the petitioner Schneble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.954" offset="8881488">I also want to point out to you that I feel that this harm that's done in these situations is the reason for the rule in Bruton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.314" offset="8930912">It was also the reason for the Criminal Rule 14 of the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedures which I recognize is not binding on the state of Florida, but they are inductive of the opinion that exist with regard to what constitution violation of a person's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.196" offset="8998412">And so when you put these two cases together, put them in the same (Inaudible) and require, -- understand together, fall together, certainly there is no way that you can say that the defendant Schneble was not prejudiced by the defendant's Snell presence in that courtroom, being tried in the joint trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.047" offset="9073854">And although it's a matter of degree I concede that it is a matter of degree but certainly he was prejudiced by Snell's presence there, just the same as Snell was prejudiced by Schneble’s presence there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.856" offset="9133100">And we are arguing about the question of degree and that should not be the controlling factor because if Schneble would have come out of there on his own with a life sentence whereas by standing with Snell, he got the death sentence, then he has been prejudiced in this instance because otherwise he'd be walking out with his life not in jeopardy as he stands today.</text>
