            <text syncTime="35.944" offset="273039">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.945" offset="285056">The instant case is a direct appeal from a decision of the United State District Court for the Northern District of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.265" offset="314417">The court declared the Texas abortion law to the unconstitutional for two reasons: First, that the law was impermissibly vague, and, second, that it violated a woman’s right to continue or terminate a pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.836" offset="376693">Although the court granted declaratory relief, the court denied appellant’s request for injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.942" offset="401039">The Texas law in question permits abortions to be performed only in instances where it is for the purpose of saving the life of the woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.554" offset="439492">The case originated with the filing of two separate complaints, the first being filed on behalf of Jane Roe, an unmarried pregnant girl and the second being filed on behalf of Jane and Mary Doe, a married couple.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.727" offset="496230">Jane Roe, the pregnant woman, had gone to several Dallas physicians seeking an abortion, but had been refused care because of the Texas law.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.004" offset="533324">She filed suit on behalf of herself and all those women who have in the past at that present time or in the future would seek termination of a pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.075" offset="581598">In her affidavit she did state some of the reasons that she desired an abortion at the time she sought one.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.895" offset="608870">But, contrary to the contentions of appellee, she continued to desire the abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.797" offset="632484">And it was not only at the time she sought the abortion that her desire was to terminate the pregnancy.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="131.537" offset="655472">When this case was in the District Court, the case of Vuitch against The United States had not been decided here?</text>

            <label>Ms. Sarah R. Weddington</label>
            <text syncTime="143.049" offset="701552">That is correct.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="144.584" offset="707613">Now, do you think that has disposed off some of the questions raised now?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sarah_r_weddington" startTime="151.124" stopTime="388.389">
            <label>Ms. Sarah R. Weddington</label>
            <text syncTime="151.124" offset="733839">Your Honor, I do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.651" offset="739900">In the Vuitch decision this Court was working with a statute which provided that an abortion could be performed for reasons of health or life.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.546" offset="775531">Our Texas statute provides an abortion only where it is for the purpose of saving the life of the woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.848" offset="804684">Since the Vuitch decision was rendered, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals -which is our highest court of criminal jurisdiction has held that the Texas law is not vague, citing the Vuitch decision, but saying that the Texas law is more definite than the D.C. law.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.594" offset="871662">So, obviously the Court of Criminal Appeals doesn't feel that the two are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.835" offset="888693">And in the Vuitch decision, the Justices of this Court emphasized continuously that a doctor, as a matter of routine, works with the problem of what is best for the health of his patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.813" offset="940520">We submit that a doctor is not used to being restricted to acting only when it's for the purpose of saving the life of the woman, and that health is a continuum which runs into life.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.420" offset="987018">And a doctor in our State does not know whether he can perform an abortion only when death is imminent or when the woman's life would be shortened.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.214" offset="1026202">He does not know if the death must be certain, or if it could be an increase in probability of her death.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.391" offset="1058907">So here, in the District, doctors are able to exercise their normal matter of judgment, whether or not the health of the woman, mental or physical will be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.991" offset="1101330">But, in Texas, we tell the doctor that unless he can decide whether it's necessary for the purpose of saving her life, and for no other reason, that he is subject to criminal sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.156" offset="1149918">I think it's important to note the range of problems that could be presented to a doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.820" offset="1172592">The court, for example, cited the instance of suicide, if a woman comes in alleging that she will commit suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.780" offset="1200386">Is it then necessary for him to do or can he do an abortion for the purpose of saving her life?</text>
            <text syncTime="274.104" offset="1225777">Or, is that a situation where he has to have something more?</text>
            <text syncTime="277.406" offset="1238943">I think all of those questions cannot be answered, at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.013" offset="1253363">This brings up the married couple in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.840" offset="1264648">The woman in that case had a neurochemical condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.065" offset="1277604">Her doctor had advised her not to get pregnant, and not to take the birth control pills.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.462" offset="1295159">She was using alternative means of birth control, but she and her husband were fearful that she would become pregnant and that, although the neurochemical condition would impair her health, evidently her doctor did not feel that she would die if she continued the pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.923" offset="1369033">And certainly they were very concerned about the effect of the statute, and her physician seemed uncertain about its implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.879" offset="1412814">The doctors in our State continue to feel that our law is vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.204" offset="1438101">Certainly, we introduced affidavits in the lower court to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.474" offset="1455237">Since the time of the lower court ruling, the District Attorney in Texas has said that he considers the Federal court decision there not to be binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.877" offset="1504870">And we do have a letter from him and the first thing in our Appendix to the brief, stating that he will continue to prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.312" offset="1534545">So the doctors in Texas, even with the Federal decision and even after the Vuitch decision, do not feel free to perform abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.027" offset="1565474">And, instead, 728 women in the first nine months after the decision went to New York for an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.419" offset="1590969">Texas women are coming here.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.824" offset="1600582">It's so often the poor and the disadvantaged in Texas who are not able to escape the effect of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.720" offset="1628168">Certainly, there are many Texas women who are affected because our doctors still feel uncertain about the impact of the law, even in light of the Vuitch decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.050" offset="1725552">It is only the claim of unconstitutional vagueness, that the Court explicitly didn't reach any of the other claims, and you make many other claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.135" offset="1761810">Of course, before you get to any of those, there are a good many threshold questions, are there not, of jurisdiction?</text>

            <text syncTime="415.234" offset="1790231">I think it is important to point out to the Court that in my reading of Younger versus Harris, the companion cases, all the Court was concerned about in those cases was a situation where there was an attempt to interfere with a pending state criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.964" offset="1865150">In this case, as I pointed out, the original parties to this matter are women, and in one case, the husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.957" offset="1897124">The women certainly are not subject to prosecution in the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.572" offset="1915619">It is impossible for them to stand in the criminal dock and litigate their interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.305" offset="1934532">They came seeking injunctive relief. But it was not against pending State criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.277" offset="1954385">They were not even aware of the prosecution against Dr. Hallford.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="459.978" offset="1969222">Could they, under Texas law, be charged as accomplices or as co-conspirators, or anything like that?</text>

            <text syncTime="468.033" offset="2001405">In one situation, Woodrow v. State, an 1880 case, the woman had taken a potion to induce abortion, and the Texas court specifically said that the woman is guilty of no crime, even in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.397" offset="2054904">And, that in fact she is the victim of our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.577" offset="2071622">There is no declaratory relief available for these plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.055" offset="2085519">Their only forum was the Federal courts, and it was to those courts that they turned</text>

            <text syncTime="497.852" offset="2120733">One, an unmarried pregnant woman; two, a married couple, and it was shown that it would be injurious to the wife's health to have a child and also injurious to her health to use the most efficient form of birth control; and, then third, is a physician who is under indictment, or was, at the time of this complaint.</text>

            <label>Ms. Sarah R. Weddington</label>
            <text syncTime="519.876" offset="2208817">The physician intervened after the order was entered granting Jane Roe a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.249" offset="2234313">And he intervened, again, asking only that future prosecution under the law be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.701" offset="2260122">He did not ask any relief of the court relating to his pending State criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.203" offset="2282169">He did specifically, in his complaint, reserve the right to ask for future relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.060" offset="2301604">But, that was never done.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.732" offset="2308292">And certainly, in the future, he were to ask for relief, the court would have the guidance of the Younger versus Harris companion cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.832" offset="2340684">But there was in no way any request for any action to interfere with the pending criminal prosecutions then in process.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.995" offset="2417275">There is an allegation that the question is moot since the woman has now has carried the pregnancy to term.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.518" offset="2451338">And I think it is important to realize that there are several important aspects in which this case differs from the case that the Courts might usually be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.295" offset="2502538">First, the case is different in the nature of the interest which is involved, and in the extent to which personal determination is undermined by this statute - the effect that it has on women.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.039" offset="2549454">Second, it is unique in the type of injury that's presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.004" offset="2565337">Certainly there are some injuries that can be compensated, and most last over a sufficient period of time for the courts to litigate the interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.718" offset="2600236">But in this case, a progressing pregnancy does not suspend itself in order to give the courts time to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.001" offset="2633359">Certainly Jane Roe brought her suit as soon as she knew she was pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.591" offset="2651645">As soon as she had sought an abortion, and then denied, she came to Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.755" offset="2668364">She came on behalf of a class of women.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.610" offset="2675782">And I don't think there's any question but that women in Texas continued to desire abortions, and to seek them out outside our State.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.844" offset="2704726">There was an absence of any other remedy, and without the ability to litigate her claim as a pregnant woman who came seeking relief and who was affected by the time required by the Federal process; not because of any infirmity in her own attempt to litigate her interests that this will, in fact, be a case certainly presenting substantial Federal question, and yet awaiting review in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.949" offset="2829069">I think the third way in which it is unique is, as I have stated the fact that it is the only forum available to these women.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.995" offset="2865327">They have no other way to litigate their interests</text>

            <text syncTime="687.142" offset="2877866">Does that mean that there is no possibility of getting a declaratory judgment under Texas law?</text>

            <text syncTime="692.148" offset="2897928">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.875" offset="2900853">Declaratory judgments in the State of Texas are limited to a situation where property rights are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.885" offset="2924886">And we also have a very unusual situation in Texas, where we have two concurrent jurisdictions, one the civil and one the criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.443" offset="2955084">And even -- there are some cases which indicate that our State Supreme Court would not have the ability to mandamus any of the criminal prosecution officers because the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has jurisdiction as to all criminal matters in the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.433" offset="3023002">So, even if the woman had been able to bring a declaratory judgment -- which she couldn't -- she couldn't have gotten any sort of relief against future prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.265" offset="3058424">And it was exactly the absence of the court granting an injunction against future prosecutions which had resulted in the irreparable injuries these women have suffered.</text>

            <text syncTime="765.243" offset="3190290">In the absence of abortions, or legal medically safe abortions-women often result to the illegal abortions, which certainly carry risks of death, all the side effects such as severe infections, permanent sterility, all the complications that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.796" offset="3252462">And, in fact, if the woman is unable to get either a legal abortion or an illegal abortion in our State, she can do a self-abortion, which is certainly, perhaps, by far the most dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.303" offset="3298542">And that is no crime. She is in our State</text>

            <text syncTime="807.957" offset="3361131">Texas, for example, it appears to us, would not allow any relief at all, even in situations where the mother would suffer perhaps serious physical or mental harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.852" offset="3404703">There is certainly a great question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.439" offset="3415048">If the pregnancy would result in the birth of a deformed or defective child, she has no relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.056" offset="3437513">Regardless of the circumstances of conception, whether it was because of rape, incest, whether she is extremely immature, she has no relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.512" offset="3471368">I think it's without question that pregnancy to a woman can completely disrupt her life.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.386" offset="3494878">Whether she's unmarried; whether she's pursuing an education; whether she's pursuing a career; whether she has family problems; all of the problems of personal and family life, for a woman, are bound up in the problem of abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.977" offset="3561229">For example, in our State there are many schools where a woman is forced to quit if she becomes pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.108" offset="3589755">In the City of Austin that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.249" offset="3598323">A woman, if she becomes pregnant, and is in high school, must drop out of regular education process.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.876" offset="3632804">And that's true of some colleges in our State.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.052" offset="3649523">In the matter of employment, she often is forced to quit at an early point in her pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.829" offset="3676586">She has no provision for maternity leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.226" offset="3694244">She cannot get unemployment compensation under our laws, because the laws hold that she is not eligible for employment, being pregnant, and therefore is eligible for no unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.393" offset="3742937">At the same time, she can get no welfare to help her at a time but she has no unemployment compensation and she's not eligible for any help in getting a job to provide for herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.233" offset="3786195">There is no duty for employers to rehire women if they must drop out to carry a pregnancy to term.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.277" offset="3814408">And, of course, this is especially hard on the many women in Texas who are heads of their own households and must provide for their already existing children.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.854" offset="3848680">And, obviously, the responsibility of raising a child is a most serious one, and at times an emotional investment that must be made, cannot be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.774" offset="3896432">So, a pregnancy to a woman is perhaps one of the most determinative aspects of her life.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.967" offset="3929137">It disrupts her body.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.848" offset="3940736">It disrupts her education.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.776" offset="3948468">It disrupts her employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.477" offset="3955260">And it often disrupts her entire family life.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.803" offset="3968530">And we feel that, because of the impact on the woman, this certainly and as far as there are any rights which are fundamental is a matter which is of such fundamental and basic concern to the woman involved that she should be allowed to make the choice as to whether to continue or to terminate her pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.567" offset="4047629">I think the question is equally serious for the physicians of our State.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.583" offset="4063616">They are seeking to practice medicine in what they consider the highest method of practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.346" offset="4094649">We have affidavits in the back of our brief from each of the heads of public of heads of Obstetrics and Gynecology departments from each of our public medical schools in Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1018.953" offset="4205095">They were stopped cold in their efforts, even with the declaratory judgment, because of the DA's position that they would continue to prosecute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1053.807" offset="4344589">Your Honors, in the lower court, as I'm sure you're aware, the court held that the right to determine whether or not to continue a pregnancy rested upon the Ninth Amendment which, of course, reserves those rights not specifically enumerated to the Government, to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.689" offset="4408119">I think it is important to note, in a law review article recently submitted to the Court and distributed among counsel by Professor Cyril Means, Jr., entitled "The Phoenix of Abortional Freedom," that at the time the Constitution was adopted there was no common law prohibition against abortions; that they were available to the women of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.978" offset="4517206">Certainly, under the Griswold decision, it appears that the members of the Court in that case were obviously divided as to the specific constitutional framework of the right which they held to exist in the Griswold decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.682" offset="4588050">I'm a little reluctant to aspire to a wisdom that the Court was not in agreement on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.580" offset="4623681">I do feel that the Ninth Amendment is an appropriate place for the freedom to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.378" offset="4646878">I think the Fourteenth Amendment is equally an appropriate place, under the rights of persons to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.742" offset="4680315">I think that in as far as "liberty" is meaningful, that liberty to these women would mean liberty from being forced to continue the unwanted pregnancy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1170.092" offset="4809673">Since that District Court found the right to reside in the Ninth Amendment, we pointed our attention in the brief to that particular aspect of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.275" offset="4850424">But I think we would not presume -- I do feel that in-so-much as members of the Court can say that the Ninth Amendment applies to rights reserved to the people, and those which were most important-and certainly this is that the Ninth Amendment is appropriate place insofar as the Court has said that life, liberty, in a pursuit of happiness involved the most fundamental things of people; that this matter is one of those most fundamental matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.901" offset="4976961">I think, in as far as the Court has said that there is a penumbra that exists to encompass the entire purpose of the Constitution, that I think one of the purposes of the Constitution was to guarantee to the individual the right to determine the course of their own lives.</text>

            <text syncTime="1265.383" offset="5190852">Certainly, the Texas courts have referred to the woman as being the victim, and they have never referred to anyone else as being the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.090" offset="5225647">Concepts have certainly changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.893" offset="5232857">I think it's important to realize that in Texas self-abortion is no crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.761" offset="5252396">The woman is guilty of no crime, even though she seeks out the doctor; even though she consents; even though she participates; even though she pays for the procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.868" offset="5300775">It's also interesting that in our statutes -- the penalty for the offense of abortion depends on whether or not the consent of the woman was obtained prior to the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.458" offset="5343198">It's double if you don't get her consent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.456" offset="5435149">It is an abortion, which carries a significantly lesser offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.332" offset="5454688">There is no requirement of -- even though the State, in its brief, points out the development of the fetus that in an eight-week period, the same State, does not require any death certificate, or any formalities of birth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2057.181" offset="8358042">It's an old joke, but when a man argues against two beautiful ladies like this, they are going to have the last word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.353" offset="8398688">Before I proceed to the original issue in this case-which was the propriety of the trial court grant, or denying of injunctive relief - I would like to bring to the Court's attention some grave matters concerning what has been referred to as the standing of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.772" offset="8496386">The couple involved: they were a married couple, childless married couple.</text>

            <text syncTime="2114.067" offset="8585621">That is, that the woman would have difficulty if she became pregnant in carrying a child to childbirth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2283.547" offset="9263550">That is, the case can become moot from the hearing in the trial court until the time it reaches this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.488" offset="9295315">We do not feel appellant's authority contained in her brief will substantiate her contention that the case is not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.624" offset="9351844">I might add this that I believe the law to be that if there is a reasonable possibility of re-occurrence of the situation, then the case would not be moot.</text>

            <text syncTime="2335.494" offset="9471276">It deals mainly with the capability of repetition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.726" offset="9496249">We think the case of Jane Roe can be easily compared to Hall v. Beals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.578" offset="9523626">In that particular case a group of voters instituted a class action complaining of a Colorado statute which prescribed a residency requirement of six months.</text>

            <text syncTime="2376.811" offset="9636579">And, in the meantime Colorado repealed the statute and established a two-months residency requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3430.493" offset="13851279">This statute does not establish any religion; nor does it prohibit anyone from practicing of any part of any religious group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.968" offset="13901226">I see no merit in their contentions that it could possibly be under freedom of speech or press.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.418" offset="13931005">In fact, there have been some articles recently in this City's newspaper - yesterday, for instance about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.377" offset="13958799">The other constitutional rights that the appellant speaks of, I think, are expressed in two manners: The individual, or marital right of privacy; and, secondly - or -- or the right to choose whether or not to abort a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.643" offset="14079903">Now, if those are out of the case, the marital privacy is out of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3701.375" offset="14934839">There are some statistics that will say it is and statistics that say it's not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.596" offset="14963678">It has been provided to this Court, the common law and the legislative history of abortion; and that the morality of abortion has been injected in various cases by various groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.057" offset="15037552">We think these matters are matters of policy which can be properly addressed by the State legislature.</text>
