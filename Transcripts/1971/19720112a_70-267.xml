            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="125.872" offset="577155">On the second ground, your brief at page 17 state that the guarantee under 8 (a) (1) includes the right of employees to participate in administrative proceedings of prior practices of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.556" offset="627937">I did not see any cases cited for that proposition in your brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.185" offset="642461">Is this just to be taken as an assertion or are there cases that support it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_terry_bray" startTime="145.550" stopTime="576.184">
            <label>Mr. William Terry Bray</label>
            <text syncTime="145.550" offset="655836">No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the cases which we cited at page 18 of our brief make this abundantly clear and these are quoted at the top of page 18 from the Oil City Brass Works case is squarely in point on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.466" offset="711529">The Court there did hold that the Section 7 guarantees of the employees include the right, not only of employees to participate, but to have others participate on their behalf and that employer discrimination on account of participation in Board proceedings infringe the employees' grantees under Section 7 and thus violated Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="181.839" offset="801076">The Board in this case found that the discharges violated both Section 8 (a) (4) and Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="188.977" offset="829602">The Court of Appeals refused, however, to sustain the Board on either ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.394" offset="847261">On the Section 8 (a) (4) basis, the Court relied on its earlier decision in the Ritchie case and concluded that the Section 8 (a) (4) covered only the precise matters stated in that Section, that is actually giving testimony in a formal Board hearing or filing charges with the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.760" offset="924688">With respect to Section 8 (a) (1), the Court concluded that it could not uphold an independent violation of that Section because to do so would be implicitly to overrule its decision in the Ritchie case and it was unwilling to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.755" offset="976724">We think that the Court erred on both grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.956" offset="989472">With respect to the factual setting, the Court of Appeals accepted for purposes of the legal question involved and which we have presented here, the findings of the examiner as sustained by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.482" offset="1039627">While respondents have taken issue with our statement of the case and indeed have restated the case in their brief that essentially is a result of their view of the record evidence and what the record evidence -- evidence showed.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.576" offset="1088005">And their view of the case was not sustained by the examiner or by the Board, and as I say, the sufficiency of the evidence questions are not here, they were not considered by the Court below, we instead are relying on what the examiner found and the Board sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.120" offset="1154147">On that basis, the examiner?s decision is set out in full at pages 216 through 249 of the appendix and shows that the unfair labor practices here arose out of an organizational campaign among respondents employees during the spring of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.753" offset="1228649">The respondent is a sole proprietor engaged in the electrical contracting business in Springfield, Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.801" offset="1256861">On March 18, 1968, five of his six employees signed authorization cards for the Electrical Workers Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.080" offset="1289984">Respondent was notified of this the next day and upon this notification, he refused to bargain with the Union and later during the day complained to his employees about their activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.327" offset="1342961">Several days later, he discharged three of the card-signers and on the same day hired two new employees who were not affiliated with the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.263" offset="1382771">The next day, March 21, the Union filed unfair labor practice charges regarding the discharge of the three employees on March 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.919" offset="1425299">Subsequently, the dischargees were reemployed and were working for the company when on April 17, the Board field examiner called on Mr. Scrivener to discuss the charges filed against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.094" offset="1490082">That evening, the field examiner met with the five card-signers to discuss the unfair labor practice charges and received written statements from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.511" offset="1531669">The next day, Mr. Scrivener questioned the four card-signers who were still in his employ about their meeting with the examiner and that afternoon, he dismissed all four of them purportedly because there was not enough work for them to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.762" offset="1592691">The examiner found that this was not the real reason for the discharges and that instead, the dismissals were because these employees had met with and given sworn written statements to the Board examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.079" offset="1649952">He held that a discharge on this ground violated both Section 8 (a) (4) and Section 8 (a) (1) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.048" offset="1681821">Mr. Scrivener urged that he was not subject to the jurisdiction of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.103" offset="1706063">The evidence taken before the examiner showed that indeed Mr. Scrivener did not meet the Boards discretionary jurisdictional standard, but that it did meet the statutory standard of affecting commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.519" offset="1763741">This was shown by evidence indicating that Mr. Scrivener purchased something in excess of $20,000.00 of goods in Interstate Commerce during 1967 and a projected sales from a single source to 1968 were in excess of $30,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.976" offset="1829570">Thus the Board, I beg your pardon, the examiner found that statutory jurisdiction was met and because of the nature of the discharges for having giving a statement to the examiner -- to the examiner then the trial examiner concluded that public policy required that the Board assert its statutory jurisdiction to protect participants in Board proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.562" offset="1931970">Because the jurisdiction would be asserted on this ground, the examiner also went ahead to consider other unfair labor practice charges, found that those unfair labor practices had occurred and recommended that the Board also remedy them.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.007" offset="1997694">The Board agreed with the examiner that statutory jurisdiction was shown and that public policy required its exercise of jurisdiction to protect the employees who had been discharged on the ground that they had given a statement to that Board field agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.243" offset="2062686">The Board held, however, that the other unrelated unfair labor practice charges were not something over which they should assert jurisdiction on public policy grounds and thus the Board dismissed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.495" offset="2119633">We think that the discharges here, raised as they were, under the facts as they come to this Court, solely on the fact that these employees met with and gave statements to a Board field agent investigating unfair labor practice charges against their employer, clearly come within the protections of Section 8 (a) (4) and also within the protection of Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="536.536" offset="2219839">We think that the Court below erred on both grounds in not sustaining the Boards order.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.819" offset="2244916">Section 8 (a) (4) bars discrimination against any employee by his employer because he has filed charges or given testimony under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.614" offset="2288175">It is our submission that this provision protects not only the matters precisely stated, that is the filing charges and testifying, but also the sort of in between actions involved here, giving sworn statements to a Board agent during the course of investigation of unfair labor practice charges that had been earlier found.</text>

            <text syncTime="593.537" offset="2447836">That need not be decided however in order to sustain holding in this case since here the employees who were discharged had given written statements to the examiner.</text>

            <text syncTime="924.237" offset="3770572">Precisely, and at the time Section 8 (a) (4) was enacted and it is supplanted this Executive Order, not only did Congress not indicate any intent to narrow protections offered, but the Senate memorandum quoted in our brief indicated that Section 8 (a) (4) was intended as a mere reiteration of the Executive Order and thus it is our submission that 8 (a) (4) like its predecessor covers any giving of evidence and certainly the giving of sworn statements such as here.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.261" offset="3910693">Further, this comports with the clear legislative purpose behind the Section as this Court explained to that purpose in Nash versus Florida Industrial Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.555" offset="3951862">There the Court stated that Congress by enacting Section 8 (a) (4) has made clear that it wishes all persons with information about unfair labor practices to be completely free from any employer coercion against reporting them to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.560" offset="4019885">The reason that this type of protection is necessary is well stated in the John Hancock case, also cited in our brief and from the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.531" offset="4067845">These protections must be available in order to prevent the Boards challenge of information from being brought up by employer intimidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.658" offset="4100342">The basic aim was to keep free and unimpeded the channels of communications between both the Board on the one hand and the participants in its proceedings on the other and to dispel any fear by the participants that by assisting the Board in its investigation, they might be subjected to employer reprisals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.599" offset="4188113">Preliminary preparations, including the taking of sworn statements such as here, are every bit as essential to an effective Board proceeding as are the filing of charges and the actual giving of testimony in a formal Board hearing and thus should be included within the scope of this Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.473" offset="4267525">As I have indicated, this interpretation for which we urge is highly consistent with the legislative history of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.523" offset="4299813">It -- certainly under the Executive Order, under the National Industrial Recovery Act this type of statement would have been protected in Congress when it was replaced the Executive Order with Section 8 (a) (4), indicated that it did not intend to change the coverage of protection afforded.</text>

            <text syncTime="1161.236" offset="4718608">This view also is consistent with longstanding Board interpretation of Section 8 (a) (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.163" offset="4742327">The Board has not always invoked Section 8 (a) (4) when other violations are involved and the remedies for those other violations would be the same as the remedies under Section 8 (a) (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.941" offset="4793423">Indeed, we think that explains the Overprotective Service Company case on which respondents rely and in which the Board merely adopted its examiners finding that it would not invoke an 8 (a) (4) violation pro forma and without considering the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.219" offset="4858520">Where the Board has given detailed consideration to the issue, it has uniformly held at Section 8 (a) (4) is violated when an employer makes discharges because of participating in Board proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.599" offset="4924035">The practicalities of agency action also demand this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.777" offset="4940753">A participant in a Board proceeding often does not actually file charges or testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.236" offset="4962592">He may not testify because his testimony is cumulative as happened in the Dal-Tex case or because the cases settled or dismissed before it gets to hearing which happens in over 90% of the Boards cases according to its 35th Annual Report or the situation may be as it was here, the employer discharges his employees immediately upon learning of their assistance to the Board and before any hearing could possibly have started.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.511" offset="5071679">If no protection is afforded for participants in these situations and we think it is obvious that the participants will be much less willing to assist in Board proceedings and that this will impair the Board in its investigative and other statutory efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.367" offset="5135104">Finally, several Courts of Appeals had agreed with our view of Section 8 (a) (4), specifically the Fifth Circuit has twice sustained Board Orders finding Section 8 (a) (4) violation in essentially similar context as that presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.564" offset="5203963">The M &amp; S Steel Company case on page 16 of our brief as well as the Dal-Tex Optical Company case on that same page involved Section 8 (a) (4) violations where the employee was discriminated against either for giving statements through a Board agent or for appearing at a Board hearing, but not actually testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.521" offset="5287764">The cases cited at note 11 of our brief on page 16 indicate that other Courts of Appeals had also broadly read Section 8 (a) (4) to protect participants in Board proceedings in context other than merely filing charges or testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.576" offset="5359966">Finally, the subpoena powers under Section 11 support our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.075" offset="5377939">As I indicated, the Board could have subpoenaed these men to give the statements which they gave the agent, had they not done so willingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.127" offset="5410226">In that event, the Second Circuit has held that the Board must assert jurisdiction to protect the participants in Board proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.048" offset="5441886">It cannot decline to assert jurisdiction in that circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.482" offset="5459650">While the employees here gave their statements willingly, we think this should be encouraged, not discouraged, and that there is no sound reason for denying equal protections to the voluntary participant as to those who appear under subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.361" offset="5539166">Turning to Section 8 (a) (1), it was the Boards position and it is our position here that the discharges on the grounds which the examiner found, independently violated Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.659" offset="5588276">We do not think that the Court below gave any significant consideration to this issue and instead rushed it off with the explanation that to uphold an independent 8 (a) (1) violation would be implicitly to overrule Ritchie, even though Ritchie involved only Section 8 (a) (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.861" offset="5673122">It is our position that these discharges are clearly barred by Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.121" offset="5694125">That Section prohibits employer conduct that interferes with, restrains or coerces employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed by Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.924" offset="5737383">Section 7 in turn assures broadly that employee shall have the right to inform, join or assist labor organizations and to engage in other concerted activities for purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.472" offset="5807601">The Board and various Courts of Appeals have repeatedly held that Section 7 - that the Section 7 guarantees include the right to participate and given information in Board proceedings as well as the right to have others do the same without fear of being penalized by an employer for having done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.999" offset="5893700">As I mentioned, the Oil City Brass Works case as well as the other cases on page 18 of our brief established this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.318" offset="5934974">Further, it is well established that employer discrimination because of participating in the Board proceedings or because of doing so on behalf of others, unlawfully restrains rank and file employees in the free exercise of their Section 7 rights and thus violates Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.963" offset="6025566">Indeed the Fifth Circuit has gone so far as to hold that this is an 8 (a) (1) violation as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.042" offset="6053883">Several Courts of Appeals' cases involved quite similar circumstances to those here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.611" offset="6080110">The Electro Motive Company case at pages 18 and 19 of our brief from the Fourth Circuit held that an employer discharge of a Board participant for having given a Board agent a statement, precisely the circumstances here, violated Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.306" offset="6162866">The Southland Paint case from the Fifth Circuit similarly held that the discharge of a participant because he testified in a Board hearing and because he gave an affidavit to a Board agent violated Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.889" offset="6225246">In this latter case, the Fifth Circuit said that an affidavit given in a Board proceeding is essentially the equivalent of testifying in a Board hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.051" offset="6265893">While both these cases involved the discharge of a supervisor, yet we think the present case is even a stronger one for invoking the protections of Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.172" offset="6310405">Supervisors generally are excluded from the protections of the Act and yet in those cases, the Courts found that they must be protected in order to protect the rights of the rank and file employees to an effective Board proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.924" offset="6365367">It seems to us to follow that certainly where an employee himself who is protected by the Act participates in a Board proceeding and then he is discharged for having done so, the circumstances here, that Section 8 (a) (1) has been violated because his Section 7 Rights had been infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.580" offset="6448019">The Texas Industries case set forth at page 19 of our brief also supports our view of Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.330" offset="6478947">There the Fifth Circuit upheld the Board finding that merely asking employees about statements they had given a Board agent and for copies of those statements violated Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.486" offset="6531610">We think again that the present case where the employer goes much further and discharges the employees because they had done so is even more appropriate for invoking the Section 8 (a) (1) protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.752" offset="6588662">The reasons that we have stated with respect to Section 8 (a) (4), also many of those apply to support our construction of Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.139" offset="6626278">The legislative purpose of protecting all Board participants and assuring that all persons with information about unfair labor practices are free to come before the Board, certainly justifies this construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.674" offset="6680404">Moreover, the practicalities of agency practice and the fact that many participants do not actually testify or file charges supports our construction of 8 (a) (1) in order to assure these men that they will be protected from discharge for having come before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.067" offset="6761906">Lastly, this has been the consistent Board construction of Section 8 (a) (1) over many years and this is entitled to weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.266" offset="6794716">The Section 11 subpoena powers also support this view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.657" offset="6812270">As I have explained the employees could have been subpoenaed to give the statements and had they done so, it is also clear that the Section 8 (a) (1) protections are as broad as the Section 11 Subpoena Powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1789.231" offset="7230647">Had these employees been subpoenaed as I say, it is clear that they would have been protected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2036.549" offset="8219852">Immediately upon getting this charge, the company counsel, there was myself, wrote a letter to the Regional Director and informed the Regional Director of the Board that this company did not meet the Board?s jurisdictional standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="2065.023" offset="8333746">At the same time, the company sent the three employees then involved who had allegedly according to those original charges been laid off sent them a letter saying, You have not been laid off, you are free to work here as usual as long as work is available, this is a misunderstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.230" offset="8406575">We sent a copy of that the Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="2087.668" offset="8424339">Now, about a month later, the Labor Board agent came down to my office, as this is shown in the record and we had a meeting to go over the books and records of the company to see if in fact the Board had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.042" offset="8489854">Now, contrary to what is said by petitioners brief, there is no evidence in the record that we discussed the merits of the charges at that time and in fact, we did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.855" offset="8529142">We discuss merely the fact of whether there was jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.853" offset="8545129">Now, we had no idea that Board was going to take any statements from any of our employees at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.987" offset="8573654">There is no requirement that the Board do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.151" offset="8586298">We think the Board had no reason to take any statements from employees, if they have no jurisdiction over the company at that stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.823" offset="8616913">Now, at that stage, then, there anything prior to that time is no longer claimed to be a violation before this Court because the labor Board itself after the hearing declined to assert jurisdiction on anything up to that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.517" offset="8687757">Now, later, the next day according to the evidence, the next day after the company representative and I met with the Labor Board investigator in my office, went over our financial records which show as according to, as everyone now admits that the Board did not have jurisdiction at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.478" offset="8791620">It was at the outset, this company was too small to meet the Boards jurisdictional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.378" offset="8831222">This company as a result of being too small to meet the Boards jurisdictional standards, this company could not get access to the Board process as to protect it from an illegal secondary boycott which the union started out against the company on March 15, 1968 at a time when the Union representative involved in this case admits he did not represent a single employee of this employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.516" offset="8907708">So when that March 15, 1968 picketing started at an apartment house project where my client had some men working, my client did not go to the Labor Board and say, Please help us stop this secondary boycott because it violates 8 (b) (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.527" offset="8975731">Because the Labor Boards Jurisdictional Standard published said, No, no I am sorry Mr. Scrivener, you are too small for us to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.586" offset="9008019">We have got no time to protect you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.411" offset="9019303">So later when the Union came and said now as the evidence shows on the 8 (a) (5) allegation, when the union came and presented the cards to the company and said now we signed up the majority of your people, we want to bargain with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.223" offset="9078549">Even though the Supreme Court of the United States has said in Gissel Packing Company just a few years ago, that an employer has an absolute right to an election under 9 (c) (1) (b) under the Act before they have to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.085" offset="9138004">This company, my client could not get an election on the Labor Board because the Board has published Standard saying, No, Robert Scrivener, you are too small, we have got no time to give you an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.526" offset="9183770">We have got not time to let you have access to our processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.995" offset="9201638">So then the Union came along and this Union in this town, this particular Union in this town has a standard form agreement that the only kind of agreement they will sign is a standard form agreement which has been negotiated at the national level by the National Electrical Contact Association and International Electrical Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.491" offset="9275617">So when they presented this contract to my client and said, Now, you sign this by 6 o?clock tonight or else as shown by the record in that contract as an exhibit in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.887" offset="9317204">Even though that type was demand especially when the contract contains unlawful non-mandatory subject to bargaining and would -- and exceeding to that demand would require my client to delegate his bargaining responsibilities to another association in violation of his rights under law and even though this has been declared unlawful by the Board, my client could not file a charge with the Board because he is too small to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.355" offset="9419081">So, now the Board has -- the General Counsels office of the Board has attempted to use 8 (a) (4) to prosecute my client as a device when they have no jurisdiction to protect them or to prosecute him under the own published standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.400" offset="9511241">Now, I want to go to the events that brought about this layoff and I would like to clarify this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.979" offset="9537573">We hear talk about discharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.580" offset="9551992">There is no evidence of any discharges on April 18, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.786" offset="9568815">There was an economic layoff on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.364" offset="9583130">On April 18, 1958 which was a day or two after, I think the record shows it was the next day after the Labor Board had taken statements from the men the night before at the union hall, those statements were taken without notice to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.343" offset="9643003">We were not present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.419" offset="9647392">We had no right to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.831" offset="9653034">They were confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.767" offset="9656691">We have no notice of it, no knowledge of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.971" offset="9669543">The next morning, the evidence shows that two of the employees and Mr. Scrivener had some conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.006" offset="9697651">It was an isolated, neighborly conversation that people in the Ozarks customarily have in a small company like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.604" offset="9740074">It is not clear, completely clear who started the conversation, whether the employees started or whether Mr. Scrivener started it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.850" offset="9781034">Our version is that the employee came up to Mr. Scrivener and said, Hey Bob, we talked to the Labor Board man last night.</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.867" offset="13573178">Well, if the employee had given testimony, he is protected for against any discrimination for that testimony once the employer heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.226" offset="13602539">I do not think Congress meant to say that an employer could be held guilty of discriminating against an employee for something an employee said in a secret statement about which the employer has no knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.007" offset="13665651">Now, how can -- in all these 8 (a) (4) cases and I include the ones cited by the petitioner and I believe in every one of them that I can recall at least, there may be one or two exceptions that I do not recall, but in everyone that I recall, when the Board finds an 8 (a) (4) violation, they find it on the basis that there were some adverse testimony to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.638" offset="13760214">Now, we do not -- now on this record there is only one statement in the evidence that of Don Cockrum (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.617" offset="13800130">The other three men said they gave statements to the Labor Board investigator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.593" offset="13816012">They did not say they were written and sworn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.025" offset="13825730">There is no evidence that the other three gave written and sworn statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.514" offset="13847777">How could this employer know whether the statements given were helpful or harmful?</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.060" offset="13869929">How could he be motivated to discriminate against the employees if he did not know what they had said or anything?</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.781" offset="13904828">And I think Congress -- I think Congress never, never even considered that 8 (a) (4) might be possibly used to put an employer in a situation with this one he is in.</text>
