            <label>Mr. Martin M. Lucente</label>
            <text syncTime="84.978" offset="413640">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.298" offset="430881">The primary question presented by this case involves Section 5 (2) (f) in the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.082" offset="458048">Initial provisions of that Section required Interstate Commerce Commission as a prerequisite, the approval of a merger to impose protective conditions for the benefit of employees affected by the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.020" offset="513742">That last sentence as an alternative to the imposition of conditions by the Commission, provide that not withstanding any other provisions of the act, in agreement pertaining to the protection of employees maybe entered into by any carrier and a duly authorize representative that with its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.687" offset="596393">At issue here, the relationship between the Commission’s authority to impose protective conditions and the right of representatives, their carriers and their employees to enter into agreements concerning that subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.430" offset="651355">The claims asserted by the respondents in this case arise out of the 1964 merger of the Nickel Plate, Norfolk and Western and several other carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.494" offset="695658">As a part of that transaction, the Norfolk and Western required the Sandusky Line from the Pennsylvania Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.450" offset="723453">The respondents were employed by the Pennsylvania and worked on the Sandusky Line prior to its sale to the Norfolk and Western.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.044" offset="753859">His employees seek certain payments which they contend they are entitled to under the Commission’s order approving the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.194" offset="786460">When the N and W sought Commission approval of the merger approximately 20 railroad unions intervened in opposition and asked the Commission to impose protective conditions by the benefit of employees who might be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.098" offset="846124">Following extensive negotiations however, the brotherhood of railroad trainmen which representative respondents and the other unions entered in to an employee protection agreement with the Norfolk and Western dated January 10, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.917" offset="913311">This agreement which we cited that it was made pursuant to the last sentence of Section 5(2)(f) provided a type of employee protection which differed significantly from that which Section 5(2)(f) requires when the Commission imposes protective conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.120" offset="986140">And protective benefits are prescribed by the Commission and employees pre-merger compensation must be protected for a period of four years or for the number of years of employment prior to the merger whichever is less.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.689" offset="1048416">There is no guarantee of continued employment and the protection flows only from the employing carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.462" offset="1079554">When the protective benefits are prescribed with the 1962 agreement however when far beyond this type of protection and constituted in effect a lifetime guarantee of employment and compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.495" offset="1139635">Initial paragraph, the agreement provided that with respect to Nickel Plate employees, N and W would take such employees into his employment would guarantee that they would not be adversely affected with respect to employment or compensation subsequent to the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.707" offset="1208494">Paragraph 2 of the agreement provided the same thing for Wabash employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.944" offset="1229497">Section 3 of the agreement covered the Pennsylvania employees on the Sandusky Line, They were given an option first to remain with the Pennsylvania or to become employees of the N and W.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.523" offset="1283727">Section 3 provided that those electing N and W employment would not be deprived of employment or placing the worst position with respect to compensation except and I quote “that Norfolk and Western shall not be required to provided employment to any such employee of greater duration than such employee and joined under Sandusky Line in the year prior to merger.”</text>
            <text syncTime="324.694" offset="1372439">The written record of the negotiations with respect to this agreement shows that the parties by this proviso intended to make the guarantee for Pennsylvania employees, co-extensive with there pre-merger employment experience on the Sandusky Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.068" offset="1437954">In this respect, the protection provided by Section 3 differed somewhat from that provided by Sections 1 and 2, under Sections 1 and 2 the employees were protected on the basis of their full pre-merger earnings, by protection for Pennsylvania employees was limited to their earnings from the Sandusky Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.637" offset="1520187">The reason for this difference lies in the nature of the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.374" offset="1539204">With respect to the Nickel Plate and Wabash employees who were covered by Sections 1 and 2, the Pennsylvania or the N and W rather required the entire working territory that these employees held seniority rights over.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.809" offset="1596883">The protection which the N and W provided was accordingly based on their pre-merger employment without limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.528" offset="1631782">The Pennsylvania employees then on the other hand who worked on the Sandusky Line, also worked in other portions of the Pennsylvania which were not acquired by the N and W.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.260" offset="1674728">Operations on the Sandusky Line or Maine by employees of the Pennsylvania who had seniority right over the entire Toledo Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.652" offset="1712239">Sandusky Line was a only part of the Toledo Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.220" offset="1726555">These employees worked part of the time on the Sandusky Line and part of the time another portions of the Toledo Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.138" offset="1758215">When the N and W acquired the Sandusky Line it thus acquired only a portion of the working territory of these employees and it offered protection limited to the portion of the territory acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.430" offset="1811400">This type of protection was intended primarily to discourage an excessive transfer of Pennsylvania employees to the N and W pursuant to the option which I have already referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.088" offset="1862078">If a transfer appeared attractive only to those with full time earnings on the Sandusky Line, it was assumed that a sufficient number of employees would remain with the Pennsylvania to permit it, to man its operation on the remaining portions of the Toledo Division and that the number electing employment with the N and W would be fairly consistent with the operational need down the acquired line.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.533" offset="1963851">Despite this purpose some employee with limited earnings on the Sandusky Line did elect to become N and W employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.906" offset="2001258">The respondent in this situation, in this case rather, illustrate the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.044" offset="2025813">Prior to the merger, the respondents here worked primarily on other portions of the Toledo Division spending only very limited time on the Sandusky Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.335" offset="2071057">They nevertheless chose to abandon their former working territory and to limit themselves to the Sandusky Line, which had provided only minimal work opportunities for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.367" offset="2115152">Had these employees remained with the Pennsylvania, it is unlikely that the sale of the Sandusky Line would have any appreciable effect on their earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.948" offset="2157471">To return to the chronology events, the Commission approved the merger in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.465" offset="2179518">Its report referred to the fact that the employee representatives in the N and W had entered into an agreement pertaining to employee protection and as to such employees the Commission found that in view of the agreement, no conditions be imposed for the protection of those employees covered by such agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.688" offset="2264468">Now, with respect to employees not covered by the agreement, the Commission did prescribe and imposed in its order of approval the traditional for your income protection with Section 5 2 f requires in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.964" offset="2329565">The approved transactions were consummated in October 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.551" offset="2351926">During the month immediately following the N and W and the brotherhood attempted to compute protective benefit due to the Sandusky Line employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.779" offset="2388811">The N and W was able to obtain from the Pennsylvania earnings data pertaining only to total earnings over the Toledo Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.389" offset="2423188">It was unable to obtain in the initial stages following the merger, a break down showing wages earned on the Sandusky Line alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.787" offset="2460804">It was consequently impossible on basis of that data to determine the benefits due to employees under Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.981" offset="2489644">Accordingly, an implementing agreement and a letter of understanding were entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.618" offset="2512109">The letter of understanding provided for monetary payments which met the immediate needs of the employees, while the implementing agreement contained a very detailed formula with respect to the calculation of benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.347" offset="2571041">The agreement very expressly provided that such benefits were to be determined by taking the total compensation received by the affected employees for service performed on the Sandusky Line in 12 months prior to merger and dividing by 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.219" offset="2646587">Following this disposition of the matter several of the employees, former Pennsylvania employees, complained to their union officials that implementing agreement 1A and the letter of understanding did not provide the payment that they were entitled to under the 1962 agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.503" offset="2723701">These employees contented that the 1962 agreement protected entire earnings over the entire Toledo Division that implementing agreement 1A gave them something less.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.777" offset="2772811">The brotherhood officials, who had negotiated these agreement, advised the complaining employees that their interpretation of the 1962 agreement was wrong and that implementing agreement 1A as fully consistent with the 1962 agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.934" offset="2837386">The complaining employees were then afforded to full hearing before the brotherhood of National Board of Appeals where their position was fully presented and thoroughly considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.691" offset="2880435">The employees also urged before the board that the question of the meaning of the 1962 agreement at relationship to the implementing agreement 1A should be taken to arbitration and as provided by the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.980" offset="2933621">The Brotherhood's National Board of Appeals, is very highest appellate body concluded that the position taken by the employees was without merit and that implementing agreement 1A was entirely consistent with the 1962 agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.614" offset="2996106">The board also did conclude that there was no disagreement between brotherhood and the N and W as to the meaning of these agreements and it consequently inclined to invoke arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.237" offset="3046679">Employees then instituted the present action under Section 9 of the Interstate Commerce Act under theory that the N and W had acted contrary to the 1962 agreement, that the Commission had incorporated the 1962 agreement in to its order, that the N and W had therefore violated an order of interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.234" offset="3134659">The N and W moved for dismissal in summary judgment under ground, one, that the Court was without jurisdiction since the action was going to enforce a collective bargaining agreement not an order of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.174" offset="3186382">Two, the arbitration procedures of the 1962 agreement were alternatively the process of the National Railroad Adjustment Board provided exclusive remedies and three, that implementing agreement 1A governed the rights of the employees in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.071" offset="3257957">District Court denied these motions but granted a cross motion for summary judgment and issued to declaratory judgment upholding the 1962 agreement interpretation for which the respondents contended.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.397" offset="3311247">The Court of Appeal deferred holding that under Section 5 (2) (f), the Commission must prescribe protection for affected employees whether or not a prior agreement on this subject has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.348" offset="3367044">The court acknowledged the Commission had expressly disclaimed any intent or obligation to prescribe protective conditions but it held that the Commission order must nevertheless be construed to impose the provisions of the 1962 agreement, because of the court’s view of the meaning of the Section 5 (2) (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="844.697" offset="3452517">The court accordingly concluded that the right set forth in the 1962 agreement were incorporated in the 1964 order and for purposes of Federal Court jurisdiction stand from such order.</text>

            <label>Mr. Martin M. Lucente</label>
            <text syncTime="870.283" offset="3554813">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.057" offset="3565888">I had just described to the holdings of the Courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.015" offset="3581771">I should now like to discuss the respects in which we can consider those decisions to be wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.731" offset="3608625">The basic and primary error of the decisions below concerns the conclusion that the Interstate Commerce Commission as required by Section 5 (2) (f) of the Act to prescribe protection for employees despite the existence of a prior collective bargaining agreement on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.819" offset="3685007">In terms of the act, its legislative history, it clearly show that congress intended to preserve for the parties to a merger, the right to resolve employee protection problems reflect to bargaining and that an agreement on the subject was to be a self sustaining alternative to the prescription of conditions by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.926" offset="3773405">This is apparent both in the terms of the Act and its legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.431" offset="3791377">Respect to the letter structure of the Act, the first two sentences require the Commission as a part of its approval of a covered transaction to prescribe conditions for the benefit of affected employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.326" offset="3846966">The last sentence specifically provide that not withstanding any other provision of the Act, representatives of the carrier and there employees may enter into agreements pertaining to protection of employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.940" offset="3909451">The only possible reason for the inclusion of this not withstanding language was to ensure that nothing in the Act would be construed to limit the right to make agreements and to require any questions in this regard to be resolved in favor of the party's right to make collective bargaining agreements pertaining to employee protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.844" offset="3993043">The only provisions of the Act which relates in any way to employee protection are the provisions Section 5 (2) (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="987.343" offset="4023031">The first two sentences of that section are thus the only possible source of restrictions on the party's rights to agree to employee protection would seem indisputable therefore that the notwithstanding clause of Section 5 (2) (f) eliminates any restrictions on the collective bargaining process which might otherwise be inferred from the first two sentences relating to the Commission's authority and obligations in the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.831" offset="4137030">This apparent literal meaning is amply confirmed by the legislative history of the Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.746" offset="4160644">This history shows that Section 5 was the results of an agreement between labor and management that congress enacted the substantive provisions upon which the parties agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.718" offset="4204530">The labor spokesman for the sponsoring group stated at the so called Washington Job Protection Agreement provided a suitable protection in the event of a merger and that labor would not be seeking legislation on the subject at all, were not for the fact that approximately 15% of the Railroads were not parties to the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.407" offset="4287286">This spokesman said that if we could get all of the roads into the agreement, we would not even suggest protection as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.669" offset="4324380">Thus the requirement that the Commission imposed protection for employees was intended to be operative only in the event that a voluntary agreement had not been reached on this subject prior to Commission approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.358" offset="4379133">The principle congressional spokesmen supporting this legislation stated the purpose of the Section as follows and I quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.512" offset="4411733">“He proposed labor clause, set-up specifics standard for the Commission to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.695" offset="4436497">But this provision also contained a clause that permits the industry through the processes of the collective bargaining, to work out its problems in a democratic manner.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.776" offset="4476831">The congressmen primarily involved in the passage Section 5 (2) (f) thus clearly expressed the view that the language of Section 5 (2) (f) provided standards for the Commission to follow but only where the parties did not resolve employee protection problems through a voluntary collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.086" offset="4561990">This legislative history revealed that every group, that was active in sponsoring Section 5 (2) (f) was opposed to agency dictated protection in every merger and was insistent that the process of collective bargaining be preserved as an alternative to agency prescription of protective conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.203" offset="4646522">Despite this overwhelming evidence of the purpose and meaning of Section 5 (2) (f), the Courts below construed the severely limited ability of unions and the carriers to enter into agreements with respect to the protection and to require the Commission to impose protection in every instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.202" offset="4718515">The decisions below effectively eliminate the last sentence of Section 5 (2) (f) as an operative portion of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.171" offset="4750385">Under these decisions, the Commission is required to review agreements relating to employee protection, to determine their adequacy and to impose the terms and conditions which it considers proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.257" offset="4798659">The collective bargaining agreement thus become nothing more than a suggestion to the Commission as to what it might do in the case pending before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.845" offset="4833036">If the third sentence of Section 5 (2) (f) were eliminated from the statute entirely, no one would question the right of labor and management to enter into a stipulation, submit the stipulation to the Commission suggesting what protective conditions should be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.680" offset="4892386">But under the decision below that is sole function which is now attributable to the last sentence of Section 5 (2) (f), the last sentence thus become a virtually meaningless appendage to the Section.</text>

            <text syncTime="2222.284" offset="8962786">I would like to respond immediately to the discussion concerning this post merger agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.916" offset="9005314">We submit that the holdings of the District Court and the Court of Appeals are unequivocal that what the agreements themselves show is not that the subsequent agreement modified or altered the protection given these employees by the 1962 agreement but that it abrogated any meaningful protection that these employees received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.268" offset="9106773">That was their finding by simply reading the two agreements, the pre-merger and the subsequent agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.944" offset="9133418">Just how dramatically the two, the latter agreement modified that the protection which we submit and the Courts found was imposed by the Commission, is I believe set forth in some detail in our brief at page 31 and what we conclude there in our discussion of that portion of the record is that --in net effect what happened to these men, three years after the merger was that they were forced to payback the limited benefits which Norfolk and Western said they were entitled to because having had received an unemployment compensation during the 18-month period immediately after the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.747" offset="9316693">They, under the law, were now receiving theoretically at least income through the subsequent agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.391" offset="9355250">And since the amounts that they had received, in non-employment compensation for the most part were not any greater than they have received by way of these subsequent agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.704" offset="9392448">They literally were told that, now they are back on their feet and back at work, they were literally told they had to repay this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.581" offset="9420034">I just point this out because it dramatizes in practical, a point of fact, how seriously the subsequent agreements abrogated or nullified the protected features of the pre-merger agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2379.074" offset="9589934">I would say this that there was at the very least, a perfunctory handling of the claims of these small bands of Sandusky men by their union at the very least, if not bad faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="2433.133" offset="9806228">We are not here contending that subsequent to agreements, the unions and railroad can get together and make what is termed in the industry implementing agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.428" offset="9847397">Quite the contrary we recognized the fact that implementing agreements are absolutely necessary to carry-out the various features of these mergers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.215" offset="9886581">Our contention here is and the Courts below held that the very language of the third sentence of Section 5 (2) (f) which says that the agreements which pertain to the protection of the interest of the employees may be entered into subsequent to these orders of approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.269" offset="9958783">That this at the very least requires that all of the protection, all of the meaningful protection given by the Interstate Commerce Commission in its order simply cannot be wiped out by an agreement whether it is based on bad faith, a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.201" offset="10034538">If the Court please, the District Court and the Court of Appeals we submit did not reach the question of the motive behind the unions and turning down the appeal of these men when they appeal to their National Board of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.666" offset="10100367">It merely looked at the two agreements and said this agreement takes away everything that was given by the agreement prior to the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.880" offset="10129206">And I might, Mr. Chief Justice, add one further point in the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.857" offset="10161075">The position of these trainmen was that their union temporized on their behalf and we believe that if we were permitted -- had we been permitted to develop the evidence in this case, it would have been that more temporization and perfunctory handling or lack of grasp about the complexities of their claim on the part of that union hierarchy which was responsible for the fact that its union did not act on their behalf.</text>

            <text syncTime="2769.440" offset="11151430">That is correct and if I may respond just briefly further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.366" offset="11175149">I believe the ICC in a very exhaustive study of the legislative history has placed its emphasis on the theory that if the Interstate Commerce Commission is not to step aside and disavow any connection or any obligation where they have met, where the unions and the railroads have agreed to conditions, that the result would be encroachment upon traditional collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.794" offset="11284863">And what we are suggesting here, attempting to suggest in out brief is that the important point, the important focus in this type of situation should not be at the pre-merger stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.159" offset="11346303">But it should be on the question of how the employee who is actually caught up in these mergers and in the aftermath stages is going to enforce them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.523" offset="11391756">And here is why we think that it is not only vital to these employees, it is vital to the railroad industry itself that as far as the operation of the Interstate Commerce Act itself, that Section 511 of that act to be given full play in these situations whether it is the employees who come to Court saying, look, we have not been for protected as we were promised under the agreement or whether it is the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.630" offset="11496246">More importantly as far as the broader economic and social aspects of this case are concerned, I would think would be the situation where the railroad comes in and says we are trying to get this merger implemented and as happened in the North Western case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.492" offset="11563642">The unions there took the position that the railroad can not put this consolidation into effect without complying with the major dispute procedures of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.780" offset="11608782">And in that case the Court we think very perceptively held that in facts exactly the facts as the Court found before, the facts before the Court in this case, that the only way that you are going to as a practical matter, avoid a situation where the union could hold a thread of strike over the railroad, as a condition of meeting its post merger conditions despite what the Interstate Commerce Commission said, how its post merger conditions with respect to the consolidation were going to be carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.425" offset="11759351">The only way you were going to protect against this threat would be if you held that the Interstate Commerce Act applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.530" offset="11783802">And in the North Western case, where it was the railroad that came into Court and said in cases and in a factually similar case to this one where the Commission had simply acknowledged the existence of a prior agreement with respect to merger conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3330.290" offset="13394826">So, that during that period immediately prior to the merger, their work opportunities were limited, but these were men that had homes at Sandusky.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.985" offset="13429621">And 15 days before this merger took place, they received a notification that they could uproot and go to Toledo and remain with Pansy or they could take employment with the Norfolk and Western Railway Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.307" offset="13474865">And in that agreement unequivocally was stated or attached to that agreement, I should say was the portion of the pre-merger agreements which categorically stated that if you take employment with the Norfolk and Western Railway Company, you will have your employment protected and you will not be placed in the worst position with respect compensation at anytime during Norfolk and Western employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3584.414" offset="14411302">All that we would say is that Your Honor, where you have a statute with the clear policy, underlying policy reasons at the Interstate Commerce Act Section 5 (2) (f) has -- which has a sole purpose of existence employee protection, to say that for any reason because of political motivation, because of ignorance of what is in the Interstate Commerce Acts or the Interstate Commission's Order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.106" offset="14526137">If the railroads can sit down with the representatives of these employees who are politically and practically disrupted in their lives by and can simply abolish out of hand, the protection given by the Interstate Commerce Commission which is exactly what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.817" offset="14592906">Then in this type of case, the protection of the Interstate Commerce act is a cruel illusion and that is what it turned out to be to these men.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.682" offset="14632403">These men ended up literally in a worst position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.811" offset="14648912">These employees literally ended up in a worst position that if the Interstate Commerce Act had never been written and then if they had never been promised anything under the pre-merger agreements as a practical matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="3683.044" offset="14805856">That is correct that there is nothing really inconsistent between the third sentence of Section 5 (2) (f) in the first and second sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.395" offset="14843263">We feel that all that this boils down to is that the Interstate Commerce Commission is required to impose conditions where the parties can agree upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.823" offset="14884955">And where the parties agree upon and the very least that they have to do is make sure that the employees who are going to be most drastically affected in their employment relationships receive the minimal level of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.442" offset="14931453">That is all we are saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.897" offset="14937304">We have an alternative argument in there that even this Court should hold that notwithstanding clause relieves the Interstate Commerce Commission of any responsibility whatsoever with respect to employee protection and at the very least this Court should hold as a practical matter, if you are going to have these mergers carried out at all, is that at the enforcement stages, they have a right to the remedial scheme of the Interstate Commerce Act first of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.525" offset="15043779">And secondly, that their unions cannot sit down and literally undo out of hand, protection afforded by the Interstate Commerce Commission or by the agreement between the union and the Railroad at the time that the protective conditions were considered and agreed upon.</text>

            <text syncTime="3779.109" offset="15190169">Mr. Justice Burger, may I come back to a point that I tried to make a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.989" offset="15209604">As a practical matter, it would be far more disastrous for the railroad industry, if this Court should reverse the reasoning of the District Court and the Court of Appeals, then it would be for the employees in the position of these plaintiffs, if I may take a moment to explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.380" offset="15303227">The basic holding of this Court, of the Courts below is that Section 511 exempts the carriers and the railroads from the operation of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.024" offset="15353800">These men are coming here merely saying that under the Interstate Commerce Act they have certain rights to protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.873" offset="15381177">Now, turn that around if you would for sake a hypothetical illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.390" offset="15395283">Suppose that Sandusky, that the employees had put their foot down through their unions and said “We are not going ahead with this merger until you comply with the major dispute procedures of the Railway Labor Act”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.827" offset="15445020">That is we do not like certain condition that we agreed upon and we do not like certain condition the Interstate Commerce Commission imposed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.508" offset="15479711">And before you can go ahead, we will strike, if you go ahead and change our contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.323" offset="15503012">Now, all that we are saying here is that the same principles which the Court applied below, that is if you are going to get these mergers in to effect and efficaciously provide employment for the employees, and if you are going to absolved the railroad from having the unions hold a threat of strike over their head, if they do not do something different to the Interstate Commerce Commission order, as was the case in North Western, you simply got to reconcile the objectives of the Railway Labor Act which we concede require collective agreements on all matters and the requirements of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.338" offset="15662986">And that is what the Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.471" offset="15667583">And we suggest that there is a real genius in the decisions of the Courts below, a very great perception because in effect it hires out the disputes related to mergers and makes the Interstate Commerce Act the applicable law and obviates the risk of national rail strikes, in situations where the unions do not like what the Interstate Commerce Commission requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3925.624" offset="15776148">We feel that, if I may say in conclusion, we feel that the results to the railroad industry itself would be far more deleterious and far more adverse, if the decisions of the Courts below were reversed, as reflected in this most practical intensely practical aspects by the fact situation in the North Western case upon which the District Court and the Court of Appeals very heavily relied.</text>

            <text syncTime="4010.803" offset="16116889">And as it was done in the North Western, they threatened a strike and if I may say just in conclusion, I lost the case in the Northern District of Ohio, three-and-a-half weeks ago where the railroad and Norfolk and Western came in and rely on this very decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.423" offset="16183345">The Nemitz case and I may take just a moment to give Mr. Justice Stewart the facts of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.398" offset="16211244">The Railroad attempted to change the merger benefits, to adjust them downward as a result of the Hours of Service Act Amendments which limit the number of hours an employee can work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.585" offset="16267982">And the union took a National strike ballot and they asked me to take the case to Court and I knew this Nemitz case was here and I knew we are gong to meet it and we did and we lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="4059.248" offset="16310718">And we lost because the Court said that the law that applies here is the Interstate Commerce Act and the Nemitz decision and the rationale of the Nemitz in North Western decisions literally, in that case in C 70-145 that will be recorded in the federal supplement, that case literally removed the risk of the National Railroad strike and it is give an expeditious avenue of determination of disputes which arise in the aftermath of these complicated rail consolidation which are bound to create disputes out of confusion or ignorance or whatever as was done this case, and in this case it just happened to be that the victims of the confusion were the employees, it could very well up in the railroad, the railroads themselves.</text>
