            <text syncTime="41.858" offset="241123">This original jurisdiction suit is a suit by the State of Vermont against the neighboring State of New York and against a citizen of that state, namely International Paper Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.433" offset="299428">It is a controversy over a sludge bed which is sitting on the bottom of Lake Champlain which lies over the interstate boundary between the two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.717" offset="348538">We have alleged in our Bill of Complaint that, that sludge bed constitutes a public nuisance that it also constitutes a continuing trespass because it is encroached over the state line on to lands for the State of Vermont, that it is giving rise to an interstate boundary question because its presence is causing a shift of the channel in the direction of the State of Vermont and that it is depriving, and has deprived, Vermont citizens of their right to freely use Lake Champlain.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.866" offset="501093">It is my intension to spend some portion of the original part of this argument in discussing of facts which I think are very important and a very short time on the legal issues which I think are simple to comprehend, although they might be difficult to administer.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.249" offset="582700">The states of Vermont and New York, as I said, are neighboring states.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.776" offset="596806">Lake Champlain lies along the boundary between the two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.038" offset="617808">It is a 170-mile long lake, a very narrow one, 12 miles wide at its widest point and it flows in a Northerly direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.605" offset="664097">The situation that we describe, the sludge bed situation, is one which exists in the Southerly portion of the lake, almost at what would be the head waters, if you are viewing this long lake as a stream.</text>

            <text syncTime="174.661" offset="772349">What are it's dimensions?</text>

            <label>Mr. Fred I. Parker</label>
            <text syncTime="181.081" offset="798053">Yes Your Honor it -- the length is 107 miles long, 12 miles at its widest part which is about the midpoint of that 107-mile stretch and it narrows down in the Southerly portion at the place, we're describing to about a mile and it narrows down in the Northerly portion where it joins the -- it crosses the Canadian boarder to about a mile and I would say that it fairly regularly narrows.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.972" offset="933577">That is, it starts about a mile wide expands to 12 miles and then comes back to about a mile wide.</text>

            <text syncTime="227.634" offset="984254">Have been -- I would like to get to the picture, how much of that total is affected directly by the sludge?</text>

            <label>Mr. Fred I. Parker</label>
            <text syncTime="237.314" offset="1022915">The evidence that was presented in the interstate conference that was held on this matter indicated that the sludge bed itself was approximately 300 acres and that the water that it then affected was about 1600 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.767" offset="1108701">Now at that time, there was a continuing discharge from the International Paper Company plant which has since ceased and I expect that now the water is being affected somewhat less than they were at that time because of the discontinuance of the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.667" offset="1200339">At the place where the sludge bed exists, there is a stream which is coming from New York, Ticonderoga creek which runs between Lake George and runs into Lake Champlain, and that stream, while the lake is running in a North-South direction, the water flowing Northerly, the stream joins the lake in a South-Easterly direction, so that the waters of the stream run into the lake and buck the current that exists there in the lake and as a result of that the -- well let me back up for just a second, the International Paper Company has been operating a mill, a paper producing mill and pulp mill on Ticonderoga creek for a period of 45 years and it has discharged waste from those paper making operations for that period into the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.506" offset="1443696">The discharges have deposited out along the stream and especially at the place where the stream joins the lake, is such a point that it has formed this huge 300 acre sludge bed which consists of organic and inorganic materials that are in a state of septic decay.</text>

            <text syncTime="426.731" offset="1780571">Both the domestic sewage in the plant and the waste from the paper making operation are treated and an effluent is discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.635" offset="1820172">We do see some discoloration, but so far we haven't measured detrimental effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.630" offset="1844205">The sludge bed however, remains on the bottom of the lake and it is sitting on land of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.362" offset="1887150">We believe that that sludge bed constitutes a continuing nuisance in that, it will continue to decay and take oxygen from the waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.355" offset="1931141">It will continue in it's decay to give off gaseous emissions causing severe smell in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.489" offset="1967608">It will continue to constitute a interference with navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.102" offset="1990073">The situation is there that the sludge has actually filled in to depths of 12 feet to a point at low water.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.576" offset="2024032">In much of that area, you can't bring a boat through there and the situation has existed for many years that as this sludge bed decays, the gases formed in the sludge bed cause huge mats of the sludge to rise to the surface and the prevailing Westerly winds cause them to float on the water to the Vermont shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.766" offset="2120790">We believe that this condition will continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.759" offset="2140747">We also believe that there will be a continuing trespass.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.655" offset="2156316">We have measured using older maps that show the midpoint of the deepest channel in the lake which constitutes the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.914" offset="2193306">We find that, that deep channel has been filled in such that the deepest channel now has moved toward the Vermont shore and that the sludge sitting there constitutes a trespass and in addition, it gives rise to a question of where boundary will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.642" offset="2276270">The existence of that sludge bed over the years and it's continued existence in the water deprives Vermont citizens of their right to fish in the water, the fish life there has been seriously depleted by virtue of the oxygen robbing qualities of the sludge and --</text>

            <text syncTime="616.318" offset="2538958">But our experts inform us that we can expect a continuation of the prior circumstances, based on that fact that the recent studies were done, were done last summer at a time when the water was unusually high down there and the temperatures did not rise as much as they have in past.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.648" offset="2616280">We expect that given a situation where the water is lower and get heated up as it has in past years that we will return to the situation that existed over past years and probably not as severe because of the discontinuance of the discharges.</text>

            <text syncTime="1886.764" offset="7620714">The report, a copy of the summary of which is appended to our supplemental brief plainly indicates that fish are now returning to that portion of the lake, and that of the various alternatives by far the safest one, by far the most practical and by far the most realistic from an environmental standpoint is to simply leave the sludge bed alone, because what’s happening now is a natural process of stabilization under which fish and other marine life are returning to the lake.</text>

            <text syncTime="2146.423" offset="8659343">In situations like that Mr. Justice Rehnquist which I have personally been involved, the New York has simply executed a consent under which the private party can remove whatever it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.119" offset="8694138">We had a case like that involving pollution of the Hudson by the Marathon Battery Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.037" offset="8709812">The case was heard in the Southern District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.804" offset="8716917">It was brought by the United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.217" offset="8726530">New York was made a party defendant solely for that purpose, or intervened I believe it was, solely for that purpose, and we simply executed a consent for letting the defendant under the consent decree to go on the underwater land and remove what was allegedly causing the disturbance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.525" offset="8783790">I think the point to remember here in regard to all of this is that when one talks about a state owning underwater land or owning the water of a lake, any water pollution whether it’s done by municipality or by any sort of an industry could be with the same logic that Vermont is asserting here, be blamed on the State, just as Ohio sued the Wyandotte Chemical company and the other defendants in that case, it could have sued the State of Michigan or the province of Ontario if it wanted to, using the same logic that they were depositing toxic material into Lake Erie and that consequently, it was the responsibility of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.568" offset="8927986">And had that happened we would have had the same situation we have here, namely the spurious injection of a state in order to provide some sort of bootstrap jurisdiction for this Court which in fact is improper, and everyone of the reasons why this Court in the exercise of its prudence and discretion rejected this suit in Ohio against Wyandotte are applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.223" offset="9006563">There are many of the state bodies, including the Potomac right here as well as all of the great lakes, the Hudson river, the Delaware river, and others where the same sort of logic would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.973" offset="9041567">Obviously, all the lands on one side or the other will cross interstate boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.472" offset="9059539">The underwater land is owned by one state or the other, and using the reasoning which Vermont is using here you could name the state as a party defendant and have any one of those plethora of cases litigated in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.243" offset="9110634">Now in contrast to what we heard earlier in case number 49, where there was a history of, I believe it’s fair to say, fair bit of grapple with the serious pollution problem in Lake Michigan on the part of the municipal authorities there, New York has aggressively acted and as I indicated took the state of Vermont – took the International Paper Company to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.769" offset="9196734">Thereafter we had the study, a summary of which is appended to my brief, and with Court's permission I would like to hand up by giving to the clerk at the conclusion of my argument, a copy of the full report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.842" offset="9253054">Vermont attempts to steer around the Wyndotte case saying in effect that it’s clear that the sludge bed must be removed, but in fact no agency with jurisdiction over the sludge bed has ever said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.014" offset="9297776">The Army engineers have plenary jurisdiction over the state waters, and navigable waters, and they have never so much as suggested that there was any interference with what little navigation may exist on this part of the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.377" offset="9343229">New York has been in constant communication with the department of the Interior and after that would be ECA.</text>

            <text syncTime="2332.452" offset="9403519">There was never any reply to any of those letters which indicated the slightest displeasure on the part of the Federal Authorities with the course that New York has been taking, and New York has kept them appraised continually.</text>

            <text syncTime="2513.025" offset="10125753">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.193" offset="10138501">I represent International Paper Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.297" offset="10150830">Our position in this litigation is, I'll say at the outset three-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.384" offset="10167235">We agree with Vermont that the complaint does not state a real justiciable claim against the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.054" offset="10193880">Secondly, that this Court should refuse to exercise jurisdiction as it did in Wyandotte.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.114" offset="10222092">Thirdly, that as far as governing law goes, the governing law in the state of Vermont's claim against New York is federal law, but as far as Vermont's claim against the International Paper Company goes it should be state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.121" offset="10278203">Before I get into the law, I'd like to perhaps amplify startly on some of the factual questions that were asked this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.920" offset="10313312">With respect to your question Mr. Chief Justice about the area involved and so on, I visited the area, or I tramped through the two mills, one of which is closed, the new mill which is now open.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.955" offset="10361482">I think you should try to visualize this part of the lake as a very narrow, almost like the closing mouth of the funnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.972" offset="10397531">You fly over the latter part of the lake, you'll see that latter part of the lake, including Ticonderoga and Crown Point is mudding throughout as the lake broadens and gets to be clear and much different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.794" offset="10440894">The sludge bed itself which lies in the northern Ticonderoga Creek which empties into Lake Champlain covers some 300 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.157" offset="10478301">Some of it is covered by marsh grass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.287" offset="10486870">In fact it amused me when I was there to see that one of the colored postcards that's sold at Port Ticonderoga shows the view over the sludge bed so there is no aesthetically difficult proposition here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.421" offset="10531382">The area involved in contrast to the whole area of Lake Champlain is a very limited area indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.623" offset="10572133">Finally, Mr. Justice Stewart and I believe Mr. Justice Blackmun talked about the new mill, I'd like to say a word about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.201" offset="10622497">The Paper Company has long been concerned about the discharge problem in the old mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.289" offset="10642873">Over five years ago, it planned this new mill, It cost $76 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.223" offset="10666592">It contains the most modern water treatment facilities that were available, which cost between $3-4 million, and as the State of Vermont said this morning there is no problem about the discharges from that mill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.880" offset="10717165">In fact, you can drink the water when it comes out of those treatment facilities, and people have done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.569" offset="10743914">As to fish life, which is a legitimate ecological concern, we disagree with the statement this morning by Mr. Parker that while fish life was improved substantially since the discharge has stopped from the old mill, as they did completely in April 1971 that there is going to be a reversion to a minor and poor fish life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.463" offset="10831581">In fact, it's not true as I understand it that conditions this summer, when the tests were conducted by a firm (Inaudible) favorable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2707.398" offset="10903261">I want to emphasize what Mr. Weinberg said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.160" offset="10918308">There is a long standing dispute as to the best way to deal with this bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.828" offset="10940982">Mr. Chief Justice you've mentioned the possibility of recovering it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.817" offset="10956969">There are at least three possibilities, one is to leave it where it is, covered it or not in some way; the second is to remove it and if you remove it, what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.840" offset="11013080">I want you to visualize this bed as a light and feathery substance as Mr. Dime (ph) stated and Mr. Wrickleshouse (ph) had tested in the New York State supplement brief points out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.879" offset="11049234">It's not a thick heavy bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.265" offset="11062713">Any attempt to dredge and remove this operation, we are told would destroy the ecological balance of the lake in a most harmful fashion indeed and there is a -- there is another question too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.105" offset="11110047">If you remove it, where do you put it and what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.685" offset="11128437">Certainly it would have to be removed some place fairly near to lake, and if it were done the best evidence from the scientist says that a lot of it will reach back into the lake so removal does not seem to be a realistic alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.250" offset="11182667">Now as to the law, I don't need to add anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.817" offset="11196982">I think that Mr. Weinberg's position, which is basically that the complaining states of course have actions for maladministration against New York of its own laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.008" offset="11237733">However, as to whether this Court should exercise the jurisdiction, and we don't dispute the Court as jurisdiction, we contend that reasons of policy and principle militate against the exercise of the Court's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.826" offset="11293008">Even insofar as Vermont's claim against New York is concerned, a state against state claim, the way the law has developed as we understand it, even though the jurisdiction which has given to this Court of state against state cases is exclusive, it is not mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.649" offset="11360300">In many cases, this Court has refused to exercise jurisdiction for strong and compelling reasons of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.864" offset="11397185">In Wyandotte, while that was a state against citizen case, and obviously we're distinct here in the sense that New York as a party as well as the Paper Company, we contend that the same considerations which militated against the exercise of this Court's jurisdiction in Wyandotte should lead this Court to refuse to exercise jurisdiction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.967" offset="11489554">These factors are familiar, but I would like to just recite them and let them into the facts of our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.422" offset="11511392">In Wyandotte, the Court pointed out that the Court would be punished into a morass of novel, difficult scientific, technical problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.688" offset="11544411">The existence and the manner of treating this sledge bed so far as we know are entirely novel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.245" offset="11566667">That is why we tried to get the best engineering experts we could last summer to look at it, and would advise us, then advise the State of New York as what ought to be done about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.609" offset="11604074">The mere differences to come up this morning between Mr. Parker's statement, Mr. Weinberg's illustrate and underline the difficulties of these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.013" offset="11641691">I think it's beyond any argument that if this Court would have take the case, the Master would be plunged in to a extremely difficult problem of fact finding and recommending.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.838" offset="11689025">I don't think it's any answer as Vermont might suggest later on on to say a Master can do it all because as we understand it even after the Master does it, as Mr. Justice Stone pointed out in Georgia against Pennsylvania, there still remains in this Court, the duty of independently examining the evidence itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.159" offset="11762272">Moreover, it seems to us that the Court would be entering into an area that Congress has expressly refused to preempt and rather has left to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.828" offset="11812950">The policy of course, we think would be great if this Court would have withdrawn of into the morass of tort litigation arising from water pollution at the expense of its ability to deal with the ever broadening range of problems that come before this Court in massive numbers and are federally oriented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.628" offset="11900199">If you were to take this case, it's difficult for us to see how you can pick and choose between other pollution cases which would be sure to come here and with the environmental concerns that surround the countries (Inaudible) now we think inevitable they would come here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.989" offset="11965609">We therefore suggest this case should be resolved at the lower level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.307" offset="11982954">We suggest that the proper course of action is for the Court to refuse to take this case and to remit Vermont to the type of procedure that the Court has said again and again should prevail in these matters and that is conference, concessions, cooperation at the lower level where these things could and should be resolved.</text>

            <text syncTime="3067.360" offset="12343131">But my point here is, I don't think that the State should come in here and call upon the really extraordinary remedy of original jurisdiction, which this Court has said time and again, should be sparingly exercised and only in unusual circumstances when it is refused as the state of Vermont refused in the fall of 1972 to proceed with this engineering study which Mr. Weinberg will leave with the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.119" offset="12438112">The door was slammed and it seems to me in a novel for a State to stand before this Court and try to invoke the original jurisdiction, which should be sparingly exercised and which when it's been called into play and water pollution cases has raised a host of difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.431" offset="12503418">Mr. Justice Holmes spoke about this as early as 1900, 72 years ago and it certainly not any easy today than it was then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.589" offset="12532048">So, I would suggest that an element and a strong element in this Court's discretion should be not only the availability of an alternative litigating board and we are subject to suits in Vermont.</text>

            <text syncTime="3466.496" offset="13939630">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.943" offset="13953423">It seems clear to me that the Court has well in mind the issues in this case and I don't have anything further except that I hate to leave the record reflecting the New York allegations of diligence and for suing International Paper Company, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.053" offset="14037851">The discharges in the Lake Champlain have occurred for 45 years and many, many years there were no suits, whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.865" offset="14069093">It was several years after Vermont began pushing New York before any litigation was initiated and it's notable that no litigation ever sought a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.989" offset="14121652">In fact, what happened in each case was that International Paper Company would come forward with its schedule as to abatement and New York would agree with it and then there were delays and there were numerous changes of deadline until such time as the Paper Company finally did construct and began operation of its new mill at which point the question of the lawsuit became moot.</text>
