            <text syncTime="5.153" offset="94307">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.290" offset="102876">So Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.359" offset="115101">This matter evolves from a petition for a writ of habeas corpus which was filed by the present respondent, Robert Williams in 1969 in the federal District Court in the district of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.187" offset="166405">Mr. Williams had been arrested in the city of Bridgeport, Connecticut in October, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.390" offset="191274">He had been charged with a number of state criminal violations relative to his possession of a quantity of heroin, a pistol, and a machete.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.184" offset="234428">In those state prosecutions, Mr. Williams had filed motions to suppress those items to prevent them from being used as evidence in his state trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.594" offset="276015">These motions were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.602" offset="284061">Mr. Williams was subsequently convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.954" offset="293465">He took an appeal to the state's Supreme Court for the state of Connecticut which affirmed his conviction and likewise ruled that the items which had been taken from this possession by a Bridgeport police officer had not been taken illegally or in any violation of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.078" offset="362010">Thereafter, Mr. Williams filed the instant petition in the District Court for the district in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.188" offset="386461">That court ruled likewise that his rights had not been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.485" offset="403597">They affirmed the prior decisions of the Connecticut courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.094" offset="422092">Thereafter, the matter was appealed to the circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.381" offset="439228">Initially, that court again affirmed the lower court, the District Court ruling by a divided court, 2 to 1 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.167" offset="466291">The respondent thereafter petitioned for a rehearing and a rehearing en banc was granted and the result of which was a per curiam decision which reversed the lower court's, the prior court decisions and ruled, in fact, that the Bridgeport police officer had no constitutional basis or no valid reason for removing certain items from Mr. Williams' possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.846" offset="553018">I think that factually the facts are not in great detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.745" offset="568691">It is a relatively simple factual situation, in that on the early morning of October 20, 1966, a Bridgeport Police Sergeant by the name of John Connolly who was veteran of 20 years service on the Bridgeport Police Department was on petrol duty alone in the city of Bridgeport in a particular area of the city which was noted for a high incidents of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.345" offset="675062">At that time he was in a gasoline station at the intersection of two public streets in the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.983" offset="697632">He met and he had a conversation with a person whom he knew, who was known to him, that particular person indicated to him that there was another person seated in an automobile nearby in a street known as Hamilton Street and that that person, who incidentally developed to be the respondent Robert Williams, that he had drugs and then he had a pistol in his waistband.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.514" offset="791777">Thereafter, the officer proceeded out of the gasoline station across the street of Hamilton Street to the particular automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.232" offset="826572">He knocked on the window of the car, he asked the respondent to open the car door.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.403" offset="847261">In response thereto Mr. Williams rolled down the automobile window on the passenger side.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.388" offset="871189">The officer immediately placed one hand in through the open car window inside of the respondent's coat which was open and directly on to the handle of a pistol, which he seized and removed from the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.837" offset="933047">Apparently, the coat was open, he apparently didn't touch Mr. Williams' body at all other than inside of his coat.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.417" offset="959379">The revolver was fully loaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.599" offset="972022">He then proceeded to place Mr. Williams under arrest, advised him of his constitutional rights relative to statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.715" offset="1000547">Then a further search was conducted of the person of Mr. Williams which disclosed a quantity of heroin, at two locations on his person and a search was conducted of the automobile there on Hamilton Street which disclosed a large machete concealed under the passenger seat where Mr. Williams had been seated.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.530" offset="1091767">As I indicated earlier, there were motions made within the state courts to suppress these items as evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.587" offset="1112038">There is no dispute that they were timely made, they were overruled, the matter was affirmed by the Connecticut Supreme Court and the United States District Court reversed in per curium opinion from which my client, the warden into actuality of the state of Connecticut petition for certiorari which was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.800" offset="1184867">The state, the Warden petitioner in the various courts in which this has been presented has tried to urge that the issues here to be framed in the dual consideration which is presented within the decision of the Terry case, more particularly at page 20 of the Terry case.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.005" offset="1261667">I think it goes without saying that, it's the position of the petitioner that many statements contained within the decision of Terry versus United States both within the majority decision and the concurring decision are uniquely applicable to the factual situations in the case of Robert Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.644" offset="1336273">In the Terry decision, at page 20 of the reported decision, the Chief Justice urges that a dual consideration must be inquired into when determining in this type of a situation, where a officer making a self-protection search and the first consideration is whether the officer's actions were justified at their inception and second consideration is whether the activities or actions were related reasonably in scope to the circumstances which justify the interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.931" offset="1457377">And I would respectfully submit that the actions of the officer, officer John Connolly in leaving the gasoline station after he received this particular information, which is I indicated, was from a person who he knew by name and who he had had prior conversations with and whom he believed to be a person who was trustworthy and reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.794" offset="1544835">That his actions in leaving the gas station on the basis of that information in going over to the automobile to make the investigation, a further investigation were completely justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.039" offset="1597811">I would point out that in most of the reported cases, I think that most of the cases that I have read which relate to street investigations in which an officer receives information and then proceeds to make some sort of an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.280" offset="1646817">I think the great majority of those cases involve situations where the officer receives his information from someone who is unknown to him, from a person who comes up to him and relates to him that some unusual activity or some type of criminality is taking place and then he makes his decision to proceed or not proceed or whatever he is going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.542" offset="1719855">But I think it's of considerable importance here that that was not the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.871" offset="1741171">This is not the situation where a person who was stranger to an officer comes up and indicates information to him on basis of which he makes his investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.605" offset="1776071">I think, is relevant, because in the case of an unknown or unnamed individual, the individual after giving the information can go about his ways and quite possibly never be located by the officer again, whereas this is not the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.673" offset="1832391">Here the officer knew this individual and knew him my name and of course if the information had been incorrect, he could come back and locate that person additionally and inquire as to why it had been made to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.752" offset="1884636">The officer arrives at the side of the car in which Mr. Williams was seated, the window was lowered and I think that then he had to make the decision, which in all probability is the crux of this particular case, and that is whether or not he was justified in reaching his hand in through the open window and into the waist of the respondent where he found and came in contact with the handle of the revolver and removed it.</text>

          <turn speaker="donald_a_browne" startTime="506.989" stopTime="560.696">
            <label>Mr. Donald A. Browne</label>
            <text syncTime="506.989" offset="2101661">He received a sentence on the possession of the heroin of not less than three and not more than six years in state's prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.207" offset="2126530">He received one year sentence which was consecutive on the possession of the pistol without a permit and additional one year sentence on the possession of the machete, both of which are added to the maximum sentence of the state of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.701" offset="2172505">So his effective sentence was not less than three and not more than eight years on all of the charges, that was total sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.862" offset="2205106">Again, it's the position of the petitioner here that the crux of the case amounts or evolves to whether or not the particular officer was justified reaching into the automobile and placing his hand on the handle of the revolver and removing it, and again we would submit that it was a decision which the great majority of trained police officers in that circumstances at that time would undoubtedly have done.</text>

            <text syncTime="1530.070" offset="6193899">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.570" offset="6195989">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.414" offset="6207379">The only additional facts which I would add in order to give some clarification to the situation as it existed in 1966 when Officer Connolly met this informant, was that after officer Connolly received the information, at that juncture Officer Connolly had a certain set of facts in his mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.258" offset="6286686">He had been told something by a person whom he says he knew and he had been -- he says, he believed this person to be reliable because once before the person told him something that he couldn't substantiate, but he has nonetheless believed that what they told him was true, notwithstanding that there was no basis for believing it to be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.837" offset="6369024">When officer Connolly was told, there is a man in that car with a gun at his waist and drugs, he was looking across the street at a car with a man seated in a passenger side, he saw the man, he saw the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.384" offset="6419179">At that point he then called the station and elicited help, asked them to send another cruiser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.564" offset="6451885">Having dispatched another cruiser, officer Connolly then started across the street proceeding in uniform towards that vehicle, walking to the front of the vehicle where he was obviously in plain view of the passenger inside, up to the side of the car and knocked on the side window and said, “Open the door.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.844" offset="6533073">At that point the window was rolled down which would infer possibly that the person wanted to find out why the Officer was knocking on the window and that's about as much as one might reasonably draw from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.638" offset="6580198">When he looked inside, he saw a man, he didn't know, he saw nothing out of the ordinary, the man didn't do anything, the man didn't say anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.278" offset="6614784">He couldn't see any gun, he couldn't see anything in the car that would indicate contraband or criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.091" offset="6646027">He then reached in the record sense to show, he reached partially under the man's coat, apparently the coat was in a loosened position down and his hand reached the waistband and did touch a gun, he then withdrew the gun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.106" offset="6702138">At that point, officer Connolly, I would summit under Connecticut Law, still had no probable cause to believe that any crime had been committed because in Connecticut, it's not a crime to carry a gun at your waist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.302" offset="6754905">Unfortunately -- alright, well I won't, I have positive comment on my feelings about those laws but Connecticut appears to be a pro-gun state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.911" offset="6789282">Our constitution protects the right of individuals to carry guns in their own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.493" offset="6811643">We have statutes which permit people to carry guns around at their waist or in their car or hidden in their purse and concealed wherever they please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.354" offset="6847065">The only requirement being either that they come within one of approximately 10 exceptions in the statute which permit people to carry guns without permits or that they have a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.304" offset="6890846">So, when Officer Connolly knew a man had a gun, that's all he know, he didn't know that the man was commenting a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.830" offset="6916969">When he withdrew the gun from Mr. William's waistband, he still didn't have a probable cause I would summit to arrest him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.511" offset="11247757">My initial reaction to this case in the light of Terry is that, was Officer Connolly justified in going across and making a search because when Officer Connolly went across the street, he did not have Terry versus Ohio in mind because Terry versus Ohio was two years away at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.744" offset="11336678">Officer Connolly knew there was a man, he was told there was a man with a gun at his waist and drugs, and went he walked over to that car, he went over with one thing in mind and he did that one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.411" offset="11379310">He executed a body search of that one man to seize the gun, and having seized what he was told, he would find, he decided at that point, he was going to arrest him and that to me is what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.553" offset="11439914">This isn't -- to me this is not what I conceptualize to be a Terry situation which I read as being an attempt to relate the street experience problem of the police officer to the limitations of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.829" offset="11505011">It's otherwise, I find it difficult to square Terry with the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.955" offset="11521521">But, if one says that the police officer has legitimate reason at certain points to make a confrontation and having made that confrontation where the facts present themselves, he then has a right to conduct a limited pat-down for his own safety or for the safety of citizens, then it is more, more reasonable to relate the Terry situation to the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Donald A. Browne</label>
            <text syncTime="3585.210" offset="14414530">The question of the possibility of a pistol permit appears for the first time in 1970 when the matter is argued to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.753" offset="14456639">In other words, in the superior court Connecticut, in the Connecticut Supreme Court and in United States District Court, counsel for Mr. Williams never advanced the argument which is being made here to you gentlemen this afternoon and which was concededly made in the the Second Circuit court, that being the possibility that he might have had a permit and consequently if he had have had a permit, then his possession of that pistol might not have been a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.855" offset="14553083">So consequently, the petitioner, the Warden or the state or what have you, never presented to any of the lower courts any evidence regarding the frequency with which pistol permits are issued by the Superintendent of Police in Bridgeport.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.777" offset="14612747">In other words, before Mr. Williams' possession of the pistol to have been legal and not a violation of this particular statue, he would have had to have obtained a permit from the Superintendent of Police in Bridgeport.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.074" offset="14661961">Now, that particular issue itself was never framed in any of the arguments at all before the state court that was never presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.024" offset="14689756">It was never framed within the pleadings of the petition itself for a habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.306" offset="14710863">It was argued in any fashion whatsoever before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.150" offset="14726223">So it took Williams four years from 1966 to 1970 to determine that possibly he might have had a permit that possibly he might not have been guilty of this particular statue which relates to carrying a gun and I submit that accordingly the state or the petitioner here has never presented any particular evidence on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.135" offset="14810232">I think that it follows also as to whether or not officer Connolly was justified in arresting him for carrying a pistol without a permit that once he found out that the pistol was there, once he removed that pistol, I think that, that attaches a tremendous amount of reliability or credibility to the balance of the information received in addition to the the pistol, he also had narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.605" offset="14904064">In other words -- and I think that it's a fair conclusion that officer Connolly could legitimately reach that if the man has a pistol and if he has narcotics that he doesn't have a permit to carry that pistol because I am sure the evidence would have shown that pistol permits are not granted without any consideration to anybody that applies for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.388" offset="14979192">Pistol permits are granted only upon a substantial causative persons entitled to have one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.513" offset="14999672">Finally, the last argument that I would make about pistol permit is of course that the all that was necessary for Mr. Connolly to arrest Robert Williams was probable cause that Mr. Williams had committed the particular crime of carrying a pistol without a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.195" offset="15050454">It wasn't necessary that he proved it without a doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.252" offset="15062680">I think that again Connolly could have justifiably relied upon his 20 years experience as a police officer in saying that when he placed this man under arrest for carrying a pistol without a permit that if the man had in fact had a permit he would have told him so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.112" offset="15118164">I think he would have told him so emphatically that you can't arrest me for this particular charge, I do have a permit issued by your Superintendent of Police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.147" offset="15146272">Of course finally that there is no claim at all that I can see that in fact he was illegally arrested because he had a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.258" offset="15174693">I think it's conceded that he did not have one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.054" offset="15193919">Again, I submit and it would be our position that there is absolutely no indication here whatsoever that officer Connolly knew Robert Williams before this incident, that he was acting out of any desire to harass Williams, that he was acting out of any motive, any improper motive of any sort whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="4024.628" offset="16172152">So that this was the first time that he had claimed to my knowledge that there was an improper activity in moving out of the gas station and across next to the automobile and again as far as the final action in the officer in reaching it and seizing the pistol I think that the one sentence of the Chief Justice in the Terry case that it would be unreasonable to require that police officers take unnecessary risks in the performance of their duties, was completely applicable to the activity of Sergeant Connolly in doing what he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.520" offset="16295764">As I urged in my earlier argument, I think it's balance of the intrusion involved as against the possibility of a substantial injury or a violent crime upon himself, I think the election which he did was completely proper.</text>
