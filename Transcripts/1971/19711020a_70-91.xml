            <label>Mr. Richard L. Goff</label>
            <text syncTime="6.602" offset="100050">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.016" offset="121680">Trying to pick up where we left off yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.231" offset="134637">The government has pointed out in its brief that the various branches of the armed services have promulgated regulations, which provide for an elaborate administrative review machinery of conscientious objector application.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.842" offset="189076">Now, in this case, the petitioner in cases like a petitioner has already completed an exhausted that elaborate administrative review of machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.802" offset="224916">It is important to focus on the fact that his habeas corpus petition challenges and seeks review of the validity of that administrative determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.040" offset="261801">It is not a situation like was present in the Gusik case or the case of Noyd v. Bond, which the petitioner in habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.445" offset="295446">And, the petitioner was brought to challenge and seek review of alleged invalidity or asserted errors in the military criminal proceedings which were pending against the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.577" offset="332018">Here, on the other hand, the petitioner asserts in Court a right to discharge of the conscientious objector, which right is independent of those criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.060" offset="369948">It is not depended on any invalidity of those proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.005" offset="381650">But, rather it arises from the wrongful administrative denial of his application for discharges of conscientious objector without basis and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.277" offset="414774">So the government’s reliance on the exhaustion of court-martial that was required in Noyd v. Bond and in Gusik v. Shilder.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.614" offset="448106">We believe it is completely inapplicable and I think the government itself recognized this only two years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.559" offset="471930">In a memorandum, which the Solicitor General submitted to this Court in the case of Craycroft v. Ferrall, a memorandum which we were not able to discover until yesterday that in clerk's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.521" offset="511740">But, in that particular case the department -- the Solicitor General stated very specifically Department of Justice had determined to withdraw its support of the position previously urged in the brief in our position in Noyd v. McNamara that military judicial remedies must be exhausted before resort by a serviceman with conscientious objector claims to civilian courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.999" offset="1093644">That is my understanding Your Honor, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.452" offset="1103466">The Department of Justice did say, and this is the key point into this last memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.543" offset="1115796">It is simply our view shared by the Department of Defense that resort to Court’s Marshall should not be required before we do judicial review of a conscientious objector claim can be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.254" offset="1162712">Now, I recognized the right of the government to change its mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.472" offset="1175564">But, I really think they were right the first time, because I would submit that the exhaustion requirement, which they would now seek to impose, that is the demand exhaust military criminal proceedings against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.619" offset="1224152">In the first place serves none of the purposes, which underlie the exhaustion requirement, as it has been previously been developed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.394" offset="1255290">The government has conceded that requiring resort to Court-martial remedy would not serve any purpose of allowing an administrative agency or the military tribunal to develop a fact record, to exercise administrative discretion, to apply any expertise to factual questions or even to special questions of military law.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.395" offset="1339299">Such was -- as was also emphasized by this Court in Noyd v. Bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.735" offset="1356645">Furthermore, the requiring resort to Court-martial on this here, it is not necessary to avoid a judicial intrusion into -- or judicial intrusion upon or preemption of an agency to which either congress or the military has confided the primary responsibility for deciding or reviewing the basic question, which is now being presented to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.664" offset="1464374">The agency was responsible to decide that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.552" offset="1475868">That is the secretary of the army has already decided it and we now seek in federal court, the review of that particular determination, so there is no effort here to disrupt the administrative decision making scheme, which has been set up by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.719" offset="1532501">In fact, if the government were serious about the claim that exhaustion is necessary to avoid conflict with the military or to allow the military to correct its own errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.024" offset="1577745">Then, I would have thought that the government would have continued to insist that a serviceman appealed to the army board for correction of the military records after the secretary of the army has denied his claim for conscientious objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.498" offset="1623616">But, as we know in Craycroft the government expressly conceded that such appeal was not necessary and followed the Brooks versus Clifford decision, which held that you require a petitioner to undergo the delay some four months going to that kind of a board would work really intolerable interference with his right to come into Court and have access to the Court on habeas corpus for swift review of the validity of the administrative denial of its conscientious objection claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.757" offset="1736674">Finally, I would like to point out that the exhaustion requirements was the government lives assert here would operate in a very random hit or miss and rather discriminatory manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.105" offset="1778052">For example, obviously resort to Court-martial on this would not be required in those cases and we sited some in our brief as examples, where after the administrative denial of the conscientious objector application is taken place, the military itself chooses not to insist on ordering a man to a new duty assignment or revokes pending orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.356" offset="1863107">So, that the man can come into Court and present his habeas corpus petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.726" offset="1876586">Nor would be applicable where in cases, and we have also cited examples, where although a military defense had been committed and the military and its discretion decides not to press the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.981" offset="1917546">Furthermore, the government has conceded that it would be applicable under its standard only in those cases where the Court-martial might be willing to entertain the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.635" offset="1956207">And this results in some rather perverse distinction because apparently means that the right of quick federal review on habeas corpus would be available to the man who jumps the gun and commits the military offense, before his application for field discharge has been finally processed and denied, but would not be available to the man who waits until after it is denied and then commits this offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.821" offset="2044919">Similarly, if apparently would be available to the man who disobeys a simple order, such as to put on your uniform or to cut the weeds behind the post building.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.467" offset="2099567">But, apparently would not be available and the writ would be suspended as to someone who disobeys a more serious order, such as to go to Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.568" offset="2131959">And what it all boils down to, I think is that the army’s denial of the application could be completely without basis in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.907" offset="2165291">Totally wrongful and the man would have a clear right to come into Federal Court on habeas corpus to get released and yet a military commander, by subsequently giving that man an order of a particular kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.598" offset="2212103">Apparently, a rather major kind and then going ahead and prosecuting a man for the disobedience of that order, could effectively bring about a suspension of the right to go to Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.573" offset="2251913">But, now, of the course, the man could obey the order and then apparently he would not -- his right would not be suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.157" offset="2278245">I think that only demonstrates another perverse aspect of the exhaustion requirement which the government seeks to require.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.422" offset="2299352">Namely that operates most harshly on those whose conscientious objector convictions are most sincere, because in this case for example if Parisi has been willing to compromise, what he felt were his conscientious objector beliefs and obeyed this particular order, then under the government’s position and under the Court of Appeals position he would been able to come into Court and according to both the Court of Appeals and the government it seems quite likely in this record that he would have received a relief on the merit that he was seeking.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="583.000" offset="2405618">Well, this order was totally consistent, I understand with the tentative conclusion at least of the Ninth Circuit Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.133" offset="2446160">Justice Douglas that such an order would not put him any closer to acting military activities, is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="610.348" offset="2515019">But, I think that if we were to say, first of all what we were trying to do at that particular time was to get either the District Judge or the Circuit Justices or Justice Douglas to exercise discretionary power to grant temporary injunctive relief, which obviously depends on several factors such as the likelihood of success on the merits, of balancing the conveniences in determination, whether there is other adequate relief and to say, that our failure to get that relief before there had been any kind of determination on the merits of his conscientious objector claim, should later operate in effect to bar him from getting into Court to review the merits of that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.341" offset="2667051">I think would be totally anomalous, I think Justice Douglas in his own decision said, if it were clear that applicant would win on the merits or further protective order at this time would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.826" offset="2712922">Well, it was not clear at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.073" offset="2717938">But, I submit that the failure to get temporary relief should not operate.</text>

            <text syncTime="788.357" offset="3227117">The basic thing that we think that a man has the right to under any circumstances, regardless of the pending military criminal proceedings against him is a right to immediate review in the federal court of the wrongfulness or the validity of the administrative denial of his conscientious objector application.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.737" offset="3288661">Now, if the Court does make the incrimination, if the application would deny that basis in fact, then we would say that the question of what kind of relief the District Court is to grant after having made that determination and if the Court for example would have found that it is quite clear that an order to a new duty assignment would not had been given to the man, had the military originally granted his application, as it should have done, then I think it would be quite arguable to District Court that the right of discharge ought to be recognized and should cut across in the military criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.353" offset="3419064">On the other hand, if the District Court found that the man disobeyed an order which the Court--or which the army could have given to him, even while they were processing him out, is the distinction that suggested by the government by itself also, I might add--then the Court might well say, the right to discharge shall be recognized.</text>

            <text syncTime="1002.770" offset="4084769">At the outset let me emphasize that the government’s position does not attempt to support the denial of petitioner’s right for review in the civilian courts at some point in time, the question rather is when should that review occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.335" offset="4147045">Specifically, the question is whether the District Court erred in the exercise of its discretion by deferring action on the petitioner’s habeas corpus claim pending the completion of military judicial proceedings, where those proceedings had before them the very issue which had been presented in the habeas corpus proceeding and where it was reasonably to be expected that the military not only would pass on that, but that if it accepted the petitioner’s position, the petitioner would receive all of the relief, which he sought in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.526" offset="4283822">This, we think brings into play the traditional doctrine of exhaustion of military remedies which this Court explained both in Gusik and later in Noyd versus Bond and that the decision below is quite appropriate and should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1072.790" offset="4364801">However, at the time the administrative remedies were exhausted and when the habeas corpus action came before the District Court for its action on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.486" offset="4399597">The petitioner had committed a Court-martial offense and that offense was inextricably caught up with his claim to be a conscientious objector and indeed the military has always taken the position in this case that that order would be an unlawful order and thus, he would not be subject to Court-martial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.854" offset="4481099">If he were improperly denied his conscientious objector application would be a (Voice Overlap) process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2365.676" offset="9536419">The other aspects of this, which indicate to us that the district court below was quite proper in awaiting the outcome, of course are tied up in the fact that this is a court-martial proceeding that the petitioner did on his own decide to disobey an order that he had received prior approval at least in the sense of refusing to stay it by the civilian system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.621" offset="9632132">And, that this goes to the very heart of what a military system is all about and the obedience and duty that are necessary to that system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.723" offset="9668599">The military should be able to go forward with its disciplinary actions and try to decide the issue itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.926" offset="9697334">Further, the underlying issue of course is the administration of the army’s regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.647" offset="9724292">The military law that is involved in this case, while the military courts do not have any peculiar expertise with respect to the basis in fact test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.878" offset="9765148">A test that it will be applied in the collateral review of the administrative determination, they do, we submit, have expertise with regard to the military generally and the military's administration of its regulations and thus, might well be able to bring knowledge to bare on this questions, as well as give guidelines that might promote uniformity within the military itself or the administration of this regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.187" offset="9866398">All of which suggests that the military be allowed to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.685" offset="9888446">Further, we are not persuaded by the petitioner’s arguments that there has been a wrongful denial here and such that it should be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.285" offset="9926793">First, let me emphasize that this is not a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.059" offset="9937869">This is not a case in which the court-martial proceedings had not been brought when the habeas corpus action came before the Court for its action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.028" offset="9977784">Here, the petitioner had disobeyed the order and the court-martial was imminent at the time the district court considered the habeas corpus petition on its merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.961" offset="10021461">While the Court have previously stated its consideration of it that had been in terms of letting the administrative proceedings run their course and that was a matter, separate and apart from the court-martial itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.966" offset="10073497">Now, this of course distinguishes this case from the Second Circuit's case of Hammond versus Lenfest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.584" offset="10100037">And, our policy is in agreement with the Hammond position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.561" offset="10115920">That is that where they are no court-martial proceedings pending, there is no exhaustion required within the military tribunals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.230" offset="10154581">That is shown in our appendix, I believe it is at page 61 and that is our policy position on this that we will not require that, but we consider the two cases significantly different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.957" offset="10205468">Secondly, the delay involved in this case of course is inherent in the exhaustion doctrine itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.854" offset="10233053">The whole purpose of it as a part of this case is merely to postpone, the action by the civilian courts, until such time as the military has a chance to clean its own house if that is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.971" offset="10277566">If a mistake has been made and to pass on the same issue that is before the civilian courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.499" offset="10299613">The underlying issue of the validity of the administrative determination, whether or not the petitioner is a conscientious objector of course is very much alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.526" offset="10335766">It is not conceded by us at this point in time and it is not conceded on this record that he is entitled to his conscientious objector claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.998" offset="10369621">That is still a matter before competent tribunals, all be it military ones at this point in time in our judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.437" offset="10395430">Just as it was at the time the stay was denied by Mr. Justice Douglas in December of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.563" offset="10423956">Finally, the delay which a petitioner has gone through here is something which we do not find particularly burdensome on him, because, the order of District Court of course, has been enforced throughout this period, he could not have been subjected to government -- I beg your pardon, military duties any greater than his psychological counseling duties at the time this all started.</text>

            <text syncTime="2642.110" offset="10642130">It is not credited against his service in the military and I would understand from that he is not paid during the time either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.235" offset="10674627">There would have been means, whereby he could have gotten out of confinement during his time, had he sought to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.559" offset="10699913">The records, we have been able to check, indicate that he did not seek to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.008" offset="10717677">Although, the standard on which he would have done so, is essentially a discretionary one up to his commanding officer both wherever he is held in confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.172" offset="10754352">As well as, the convening authority so long as it has jurisdiction over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.535" offset="10767832">Yet he could have applied for that and did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.703" offset="10780475">In any event, as I say the confinement is not what he was complaining of, it was rather activities inconsistent with the CO claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.860" offset="10813076">Lastly, if I can mention briefly, we do think of course that there are remedies within the military system for petitioner, both with respect to the consideration of the issue, which he has brought before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.903" offset="10865321">We think it is beyond doubt that issue will be considered in the military tribunals as it has so far been considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.612" offset="10896145">It was considered on the merits by the court-martial itself, while that authority found that it was -- that the administrative denial was not an abuse of discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3055.837" offset="12297040">Counsel has said that the only question here is when can petitioner get access to the federal court on habeas corpus to review his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.257" offset="12326715">The petitioner on May 22, 1969 first submitted to the army his application for a discharge of the conscientious objector.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.162" offset="12362346">The processing of that application continued until November 1969 when it was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.545" offset="12391812">It was after that the petitioner tried to come into federal court and secure the swift, prompt adjudication of the legality of the contention which is contemplated by the habeas corpus statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.766" offset="12440713">The delay is incident to requiring resort to the court-martial process would be several months before trial for in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.207" offset="12474463">Several months until such time, the court of military review can review the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.874" offset="12493167">I realize at that time, it is perhaps more in this case than it usually be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.868" offset="12509154">But, in many cases cited by the governments, the delay has been at least a year from the court-martial until review by the Court of military review and in our view and of course, beyond that to the Court of military Appeals and only if the Court of Military Appeals point if it all can the petitioner ever get the discharge, which he seeks in the federal court promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.952" offset="12585432">And, it is very doubtful in our view that if he ever did get a discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.783" offset="12596821">Administrative discharge is result of the court-martial process.</text>
