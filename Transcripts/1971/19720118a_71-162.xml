            <text syncTime="28.268" offset="187411">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honor, the petitioners in this case are the Board Of Regents Of the State Colleges, they are now known as the Board Of Regents Of State University and actually to be absolutely accurate, they are now known as the Board Of Regents Of the University of Wisconsin System.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.859" offset="289706">The other petitioner in this case, is the President of the Wisconsin State University at Oshkosh, Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.003" offset="326278">The respondent, David F. Roth was the employee of the Board of Regents at Oshkosh State University and I believe the enrollment at that time was been a neighborhood of 11,000 or 12,000 students.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.071" offset="394614">Doctor Roth was in his first full-time teaching position.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.586" offset="424603">He was hired by the board as an assistant professor for the academic year, 1968-1969.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles A. Bleck</label>
            <text syncTime="101.344" offset="479669">Your Honor, I would -- I've heard but I'd -- much rather you ask the other side because I would mind to give you any misinformation.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.680" offset="509031">I think they know and I just -- and just here say I might -- Doctor Roth was hired for the academic year, 1968-1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.565" offset="568590">He was hired under a written contract, a contract that had a fixed term, expressly fixing a term for September 1, 1968 through June 30, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.823" offset="625641">The contract also expressly referred to Section 37.31 of the Wisconsin Statute which is our state tenure statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.555" offset="668482">This statute at that time provided that if a probationary teacher is hired for four consecutive years, he'll acquire tenure or permanent status.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.304" offset="723548">When Doctor Roth was hired, there was a board rule in effect, in fact, it had been passed on March 10th, 1967, which provided that in the case of a probationary teacher, no reasons will be given for non-renewal and there will be no hearing provided by the University on the question of non-renewal.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.991" offset="818216">This same rule also provided that in each case of non-renewal, the professor or the employee will receive notice of that fact by February 1st.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.952" offset="870147">So in effect, he has from February 1st to start looking for a new position.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.440" offset="908077">The procedure at Oshkosh State University in regard to renewal or non-renewal of the probationary contract was that the tenure committee of the particular department would first meet and vote on whether to recommend retention or non-retention.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.150" offset="986862">In this case, it was the tenure committee of the Department of Political Science.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.593" offset="1016642">That recommendation then flows up to the Dean, who also makes a recommendation and from there it flows up to the Vice-President, in-charge of academic affairs, and then to the President for his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.634" offset="1076828">In this particular instance, the tenure committee met and voted to recommend retention of Doctor Roth on December 17th, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.664" offset="1124998">Subsequently, and about five weeks later, Dean Arthur Darkin (ph) approached several members of the tenure committee and asked them to review this recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.139" offset="1170869">On January 27th, 1969, the tenure committee did meet again, did review their previous recommendation and at this time, voted for non-retention.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.060" offset="1222591">This recommendation then flowed up to the Dean, the Vice-President and to the President who made his decision not to renew Doctor Roth's contract for the ensuing academic year.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.315" offset="1275568">This notice was given on January 30, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.141" offset="1298869">Doctor Roth on February 14th, 1969, filed his complaint in the District Court seeking declaratory judgment and seeking reinstatement or a contract for the ensuing academic year.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.017" offset="1362399">On May 16th, 1969, both parties moved for summary judgment and on March 12th, 1970, the District Court granted the plaintiffs, Doctor Roth's motion in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.597" offset="1416733">The decision of the District Court held, one, that either the State University would have to give Doctor Roth a contract for the next academic year or in the alternative that the State University could give Doctor Roth a written notice of reason for non-renewal and a hearing on those reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.111" offset="1522791">This decision was appealed to the Seventh Circuit which affirmed the District Court on July 1st, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.176" offset="1566990">Although I have explained the fact rather extensively, it is my opinion, Your Honor, that the fact in the Roth case, are absolutely irrelevant at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.347" offset="1611711">The petitioners are not here to defend the university's action and not renewing professor Roth's contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="420.440" offset="1756012">The present posture of this case, does not involve any questions of the First Amendment Rights of Doctor Roth.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.606" offset="1792688">The issue is basically, it is whether a State University must give a statement of reason and a hearing on those reasons in every case of the non-renewal of a probationary teacher's contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2020.305" offset="8155489">I would think so, I think the major exception would be that because the District court recognized that we were dealing with academic questions many of which would -- many of the decisions would rely on very subtle reasons that firstly, he had -- the Court had to report to the university over a very wide discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.940" offset="8242111">So, in a welfare case for example, it would seem to me that a decision that there was -- in order to deny a person in a welfare system, you would not simply have to show that your decision was wholly unsupported, in fact the burden would simply in that case for a welfare director to terminate and assist – and granted assistance, he would have to show that the facts did show that person was not eligible, whereas in the hearing that we are talking about, we are talking about a much smaller burden and that smaller burden is necessary because the District Court did recognize that the university did have an interest in maintaining the probationary system, in maintaining a system under which they could decide not to retain a professor for something less than foreclause as fore clause has come to be known in tenure systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.442" offset="8480035">So, I think that would probably be the major -- the most fundamental difference between a Goldberg type hearing as part of each of the individual elements that the court requires in Goldberg, I would --</text>

            <text syncTime="2277.669" offset="9185027">The Court has recognized, when a person is interested in pursuing the profession is at stake, that that minimal Due Process is required that would truly form one side of the line.</text>
