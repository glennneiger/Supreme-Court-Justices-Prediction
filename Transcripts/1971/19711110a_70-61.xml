            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73742">We will hear the Securities and Exchange Commission against the National Committee, Mr. Solicitor General.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="21.053" offset="157856">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.161" offset="170291">This case comes here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals, for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.419" offset="207384">It arises under Section 14a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 relating to Proxy Solicitation and under the regulations, under that Act and it raises questions of the reviewability of action or non-action of the Commission with respect to proxy materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.417" offset="311352">The text of Section 14a is printed on page 49 of the Commission’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.986" offset="349595">It makes it unlawful to use the facilities of the mails or of interstate commerce or of an exchange in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors to solicit or permit the use of his name to solicit any proxy or consent with respect to any security.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.352" offset="479058">But that is simply a delegation through the Commission to make rules with respect to proxies in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.841" offset="537050">And at this point I would also like to bring to the Court’s attention a Section 2e of the Securities, Section 21e of the Securities and Exchange Act of 34 which is also printed on page 49 of the government’s brief, which authorizes the Commission, whenever it appears that there is a violation of the Act or about to be a violation of the Act, it may in its discretion bring an action in the appropriate United States Districts Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.123" offset="694202">Finally, I would call attention to the regulations which the Commission has made under Section 14a, specifically those relating to proposals of security holders which is Rule 14a-8 of the Commission Rules that is rather long but it is set out in full on pages 51 to 55 of the Commission’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.683" offset="808410">And with this as the legal setting, I turn to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.819" offset="832965">The respondent here is the Medical Committee on Human Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.340" offset="859087">The record does not show whether it is a corporation or a voluntary association and nor does it show how the Committee is made up or how its spokesman are authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.302" offset="918855">The record does show that early in 1968, it acquired by gift five shares of the common stock of Dow Chemical Corporation, a Delaware Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.180" offset="978415">Even before the shares were registered in its name, it made a request on the company to include a proposal and its proxy material for the 1968 Annual Meeting of Dow, that request related to the sale of Napalm by Dow, but it came too late for action at the 1968 meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.774" offset="1092831">Early in 1969, the Medical Committee sent a new request to Dow asking that they be submitted to the Dow shareholders in Dow’s proxy solicitation for the 1969 Annual meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.044" offset="1161899">A proposal requesting that the company’s charter be amended with respect to the sale of Napalm.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.625" offset="1192201">That appears on pages 10 and 12 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.104" offset="1210069">On the advise of its general counsel, Dow decided to omit the proposal in accordance with rule 14a-8(d) Dow notified both the Committee and the Commission of its decision stating its reasons and including an opinion of counsel as required by the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.499" offset="1303691">The Committee then modified this proposal so that it would propose a resolution which would amend the company’s bylaws so as to prohibit the manufacturer of Napalm and asked the Commission staff to review the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.329" offset="1382999">On February 16, 1969, the Commission staff informed the Committee and Dow that it would not recommend any action to the Commission if the proposal was omitted from Dow’s proxy material.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.794" offset="1456873">The Committee’s counsel then asked that the Commission itself review the staff’s position.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.779" offset="1484772">And on March 24th 1969, the Commission as shown by its minute book, “Determined to raise no objection to the omission from the management’s proxy statement of certain resolutions proposed by the Medical Committee for Human Rights”.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.871" offset="1573171">Now, I would suggest that this is a little like a denial of a writ of certiorari by this court, which amounts to a statement that this court will take no action with respect to a decision below and is not in anyway a decision by this court as to the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.229" offset="1662614">On May 29th, 66 days after the Commission’s no action determination, the Committee filed a petition for review of the Commission’s action in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.404" offset="1743280">And this brings us to a threshold difficulty with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.719" offset="1764596">The statute under which this proceeding was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.523" offset="1779747">Section 25a of the Securities Exchange Act printed on page 50 of the Commission’s brief provides that a petition for review maybe filed “Within 60 days after the entry of such order”.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="449.943" stopTime="457.766">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="449.943" offset="1873474">Mr. Solicitor General, I am curious this is brought up only in the reply brief is it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="457.766" stopTime="719.698">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="457.766" offset="1904717">It was referred to in the main brief, I suggest that it is jurisdictional and I simply want to submit it for the court’s consideration on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.149" offset="1954245">It is certainly noble to say that an order is not entered until a written notice of it is given.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.229" offset="1990607">Here a notice was given by telephone on the day the order was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.400" offset="2007326">There is no requirement with respect to this court’s judgments or with respect to the judgments that this court reviews, that the date of entry of the order and after that is what Congress said was the entry of the order is deferred until written notice is given and if it is jurisdictional, it seems to me appropriate that I should lay it before the court for its consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.077" offset="2129997">But assuming that there is jurisdiction, we come to the questions of administrative law which have been briefed by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.019" offset="2165732">These are discussed at length in the principal brief which had been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.981" offset="2189660">The argument can become rather extensive and complex and this has been developed fully and I hope carefully in our briefs, I hope for the convenience of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.924" offset="2249429">In this oral argument, I want to try to focus on two aspects which seem to me to be of particular importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.465" offset="2291538">The real controversy underlying this case is between the Medical Committee and Dow Chemical Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.141" offset="2330304">Yet Dow is not a party here and will not be bound by the decision of this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.229" offset="2366562">The Commission has no machinery to adjudicate proxy disputes, nor could it as a practical matter adjudicate such disputes within the very short time available during the proxy season.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.493" offset="2435629">Actually the Commission staff reviews something like 5000 sets of proxy material per year, mostly within a period of three months in the early part of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.605" offset="2492158">Necessarily, the work is largely done by the staff of the Commission, it is truly a matter of administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.782" offset="2532805">I think, it is fair to say that the Securities and Exchange Commission has a relatively high reputation for the quality of its work and it may well be because of the capacity it had shown to develop these administrative activities within the framework of its establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.309" offset="2614934">Only a few matters can be referred to the Commission itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.834" offset="2641056">Neither the staff nor the Commission has power to issue any orders with respect to proxies.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.514" offset="2679718">Nor can the Court of Appeals below direct the Commission to take any affirmative action with respect to proxy matters by the very terms of the statute that is committed to the Commission “In its discretion”.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.350" offset="2751084">All that the Court of Appeals has purported to do here is to require the Commission to make a statement with respect to a question of law which would not necessarily control the Commission's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.335" offset="2815032">Indeed, the Medical Committee now urges in its brief at page 21, that its petition for review sought to review only “The legal determination”, that it presumes the Commission made when it declined the institute and the enforcement action, that I think is a little bit like asking this court to certify what its view was as to the merits of a case when it denies certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="719.698" offset="2952436">Mr. Solicitor General, would it make any difference if the parties could go to the District Court and to court injunction?</text>
            <text syncTime="734.626" offset="3012204">Or do you think they could?</text>

            <text syncTime="739.052" offset="3029863">The Medical Committee was entirely free to go to the District Court and seek an order on Dow Chemical Company which could then be litigated with those two parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.571" offset="3068002">That under Delaware law, it was required to submit this and that under the Proxy Rules of the Commission it was required to submit this -- .</text>

            <text syncTime="805.720" offset="3296521">A large part of the problem here is simply who is going to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.663" offset="3316374">The Medical Committee is entitled under the proxy rules to get a list of the shareholders and to mail out its own proxy material and get its proxies and present them and vote them at the meeting and no one raises any questions about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="944.578" offset="3851989">The proposal was initially submitted for the annual meeting of Dow in May 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.215" offset="3882500">That meeting was held two and a half years ago prior to the filing of the petition for review.</text>

            <text syncTime="969.735" offset="3952612">It does not now manufacture it and has no plans for continuing to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.454" offset="3975495">And third, finally Dow did include the Medical Committee’s resolution in Dow’s proxy statement for its annual meeting in May 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.773" offset="4032756">The proposal received less that 3% of the vote of all the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.880" offset="4057206">Under rule 14a-8 (c) (4) (i) of the Proxy Rules, Dow may exclude this proposal from its proxy materials for the next three calendar years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.047" offset="4113840">Thus the issue cannot arise again until 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.806" offset="4136932">The question whether the Medical Committee will make similar proposals at that time and how Dow will treat them are entirely speculated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.634" offset="4176220">And thus, the Medical Committee has obtained everything it sought in this litigation, that is, the distribution of its proposal by Dow at Dow’s expense to enable the security holders to vote on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.666" offset="4252393">All that it seeks now is a declaration that it was entitled to get what it has already received and giving such a declaration after the event is not the proper function of Federal Courts in our constitutional system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.997" offset="4329716">Even if there were a live controversy remaining here, the judgment of the court below would be wrong in our submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.698" offset="4368482">The basic question is one of the separation of powers or more accurately of allocation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.230" offset="4398575">We submit that the administration of the proxy regulations is a matter which Congress has committed to the administrative process without provision for or expectation of judicial review as to the administrative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.061" offset="4481958">Not all issues arising in our governmental operations have to be decided by courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.672" offset="4512364">And where the problem is really one of administration, Congress may well choose to allocate it for administrative handling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.628" offset="4552175">It remains of course, subject to the continued review of Congress through changes in applicable statute, a review which congress has never found it necessary to exercise in this area over more than 35 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.385" offset="4623228">But Congress deliberately decided to allocate this matter to administrative handling without court review, is I submit shown by the language which Congress used in the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.690" offset="4680488">Section 14a of the Act laid down no rules, I repeat, laid down no rules, with respect to proxies; instead it allocated the area to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.114" offset="4738166">The Congress made it illegal to use the facilities of interstate commerce to solicit proxies contrary to “Set Rules and Regulations as the Commission may prescribe”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.248" offset="4802637">The rules are the Commission's by a complete delegation and clearly intended allocation by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.744" offset="4840671">In an area so amorphous, it seemed reasonably clear that Congress allocated to the Commission not only the making of the rules and regulations, but also the function of determining their administration and their enforcement in contrary cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1474.438" offset="5971460">If all questions under the proxy rules are subject to review by the courts, then they must be handled differently, as I have already said, they are very numerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.854" offset="6025063">If they are subject to review, there must be a thorough record, there must be reasoned opinions, there must be a clearer opportunity for the intra-commission review for all of which there is no time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.188" offset="6074486">I think, it was Emerson who said that, the central tragedy of life is that there are only 24 hours in a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.942" offset="6105415">Congress may well have thought it better for the whole matter to be handled by the administrative process without a judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.682" offset="6144390">And support for this is found in other provisions of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.370" offset="6163198">The allocation of the area to the commission in 14a, it is found in the fact that Congress made no provisions for any order by the Commission in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.231" offset="6210637">And it is found finally that it expressly allocated the enforcement of these provisions to the Commission in its discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.933" offset="6257448">There is no provision that this essentially administrative determination shall be made by the courts or even that the court shall have power to review the Commission’s action or inaction, unless it shall appear to the Commission that there is about to be a violation and the Commission in its discretion brings an action in the proper court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.778" offset="6352847">We think that this comes well within the language which the court used in the case of Schilling v. Rogers in 363 US cited on pages 39 and 40 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.540" offset="6415855">There are many reasons why the Commission might conclude that it would take no action and not every case taken to a court will be decided by that court as is evident in this court’s certiorari jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.311" offset="6486908">Another analogy that naturally occurred to me is that not every case can be taken to a court, even though there maybe a basis for thinking that the decision is wrong and that there should review as is evident in the function of the Solicitor General to decide what cases to appeal and what cases to bring to this court on petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.761" offset="6584710">These are discretionary functions and it would be hard to give a consistently reasoned justification for every decision which frequently turns on other considerations than the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.437" offset="6647404">And there would not be time to give such reasons, if for some reasons it was thought that it had to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.191" offset="6698500">All of this, it seems to me is nicely exemplified in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.357" offset="6723159">The Court of Appeals was not in a position to vindicate any right of the Medical Committee that can be done only in a District Court in an action to enforce compliance with the proxy rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.232" offset="6774568">The court of appeals cannot order the Commission to seek enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.949" offset="6797451">There is no provision for such a mandatory order in Section 25a and the decision to seek enforcement has been expressly committed by Congress to the discretion of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.417" offset="6847398">All that the Court of Appeals can do in this case is to express its view of the law applicable to a controversy between the Medical Committee and Dow, that not has not been presented by those parties for the court's consideration and the decision of the Court of Appeals will not be binding on the District Court, if the Medical Committee seeks to enforce there, its rights as a shareholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.147" offset="6958261">If for no other reason, then the Dow is not a party before the Court of Appeals and is not in anyway bound by its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.744" offset="7000684">Thus the present procedural posture of the case shows clearly enough that the only end to which it can come is an advisory opinion by the court below on a matter as to which the court can require no action to be taken and which is one that Congress has expressly allocated for good reason for handling by the administrative process and not by the courts, the judgment should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1771.358" offset="7159091">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.133" offset="7178212">I want to get to the merits of the issue presented for decision here, as quickly as I can, but I think I should deal with one issue at the outset, an issue which was belatedly raised by the government, which I think deserves immediate attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.384" offset="7247175">The court will recall that in the petition for certiorari the government affirmatively took the position that this case presented an important justiciable controversy which deserved resolution here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.958" offset="7297540">They affirmatively argued in those papers that even if Dow Chemical Company should ultimately include our shareholder proposal in the proxy materials and even if that proposal should thus reach the shareholders and be rejected by those shareholders, nevertheless this case would not be moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.772" offset="7380818">And they affirmatively argued, we think correctly, that the case involves a continuing controversy between the Medical Committee and the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.834" offset="7421046">In those certiorari papers, they cited two decisions of this court to the effect that where you have a continuing controversy of this kind, the court should go forward and decide the question on its merits, we agree that those cases are controlling and we rely upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.259" offset="7490741">Now against that background, both the government’s main brief on the merits and our main brief on the merits were directed exclusively to the merits of the controversy and that is to the issue of administrative reviewability, we did not discuss, we moved this point, we did not have the opportunity to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.687" offset="7572452">But five days ago, when the government filed their reply brief, they changed their position and suggested for the first time that the controversy we have here is in fact an abstract-academic dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.469" offset="7627518">They suggest that the action of the Commission in this case was without the practical consequences which are necessary to render the question justiciable and I think that if I can take just a moment to describe how a Securities and Exchange Commission actually handles shareholders disputes of this kind, I can show you that what we have here is a hard, live, continuing controversy between these parties so that a judicial resolution of the issue is entirely public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.580" offset="7760011">Now, in discussing what actually happens in the Commission proceedings, I am going to be emphasizing substance and not form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.016" offset="7793762">In a series of decisions of this court, the court has made clear that the appropriateness of judicial review of administrative action depends on the realities of what the agency does and not on the labels which the agency appends to it and that is the spirit in whichalike I think, this case has to be approached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.262" offset="7866695">Now, what we are talking about here is a very specific, narrow, factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.298" offset="7890833">This is a situation where a shareholder of a company has submitted a written proposal to the company and requested the company to include the proposal in its proxy materials pursuant to SEC Proxy Rule 14a-8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.195" offset="7958438">That rule provides that prima facie every such proposal must be included in the proxy materials so that the shareholders can ultimately consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.562" offset="7999920">The rule goes on to provide certain exceptions, under which a specific proposal may be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.443" offset="8027505">Now, we are taking about a situation here where the shareholder has submitted his proposal to the company and said, “I want to include it under the general rule requiring inclusion”, and the company says in response, “No, it falls within one of the exception in the proxy rules and it need not as a matter of law be included in our proxy materials and therefore we do propose to include it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.487" offset="8139623">Now at that point, you of course, have a concrete dispute between the shareholder and the company and what happens next is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.047" offset="8181837">The Commission’s rules require that that dispute between the shareholder and the company be brought before the agency for its review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.793" offset="8220811">And we have recognized of course that the Commission did not have to promulgate the rule saying that the parties must bring the suit, the dispute before the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.989" offset="8253621">But the agency has promulgated that rule, neither the company nor the shareholder can avoid having no dispute brought before the agency, but both of them have to submit therefore to agency review of their problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.047" offset="8309837">Now, specifically the rules require that the shareholder’s proposal and supporting papers must be sent to the SEC and the company must also furnish the agency with a statement of its position and it must also serve those papers on the shareholders so the shareholder will know what has happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="2128.058" offset="8585899">They take that shareholder proposal, however absurd or valid it may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.471" offset="8607528">They hold it up against the Commission’s proxy rules which say that certain kinds of proposals must be included and certain or maybe excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.912" offset="8641383">They make a legal determination for themselves whether they must include or not and they make a decision that whether they will or not include.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.456" offset="8675551">Now, of course if they agree to include it, they have done exactly what the shareholder wanted and that is the end of the matter, no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.117" offset="8702196">If they decide to exclude it, then they must purport that decision to the Commission and that triggers the administrative process which I am about to describe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.572" offset="8747962">Let me make clear what the nature of these disputes is, I think I have already got into the core of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.110" offset="8782131">We have one factual survey which has been made of what happens in the Commission when these disputes are brought before it under the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.520" offset="8823822">There is a gentleman named Mr. Cluther Rath(ph) who spent several years in the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance and he actually surveyed the papers that are submitted to the Commission and he surveyed what the Commission did those papers and he has reported the facts in a publication upon which both sides rely in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.447" offset="8903443">He makes very clear from his survey that virtually every dispute has framed between the shareholder and the company and which comes before the agency is a pure dispute of law, just a disagreement as to the meaning of the proxy rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.887" offset="8969272">The company is arguing -- the proposal falls within one of the exceptions which allows us to exclude the proposal and the shareholder is saying, “No.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.564" offset="9011904">We come within the general rule and not within the exceptions, the proxy rules require the inclusion of our proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.686" offset="9048475">The court I hope will bear in mind that during the agency proceeding, under the agency rules, the company has the burden of persuasion on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.739" offset="9088599">It is the principle in the agency that all doubts must be resolved in favor of the shareholder which is to say in favor of inclusion of the proposal in the proxy materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.716" offset="9140531">When the legal issue has been posed by the two parties to the dispute before the agency, it is first taken under consideration by the staff, that is, the Division of Corporation Finance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.010" offset="9189745">And what the Division does is make a legal determination whether the proposal must be included or whether it may be excluded under one of the exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.768" offset="9236766">In this case, for example, the Division of Corporation Finance, flatly ruled as a matter of law and it is written down in the record, that Dow’s legal position was correct and that the shareholder's contentions of the law were wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.858" offset="9305102">The Division then notified both parties that they had decided in favor of the company on the legal issue and they went on to say in their letter that, in view of that legal determination, they would not recommend any action against the company if the proposal were excluded from the proxy materials.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="2327.365" stopTime="2330.905">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="2327.365" offset="9383156">That still leaves the option up to the company, does it?</text>

          <turn speaker="roberts_b_owen" startTime="2330.905" stopTime="2657.350">
            <label>Mr. Roberts B. Owen</label>
            <text syncTime="2330.905" offset="9397262">The company is still free to include or exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.315" offset="9410950">As a matter of practice it always excludes once it has been notified by the agency that the agency is not going to take any action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.480" offset="9447626">I will come back to that in a moment and show that when it is in the reverse situation, the company always accepts the proposal and includes in its proxy material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.189" offset="9490467">Now, following the staff's determination as to this legal issue, the losing party, may if he wishes, ask the four or five man Commission to review the staff's resolution of the legal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.629" offset="9548250">And as a matter of practice, when requested to do so, the Commission does review the staff’s action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.261" offset="9574686">I might add incidentally that written legal argument is submitted to the Commission by both sides if they wanted, that is what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.989" offset="9609690">Dow presented, if you will, a brief to the Commission and said, “We think we are right on the law and we can exclude.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.722" offset="9636544">The shareholder, respondent with written legal argument and said, “We think Dow is wrong on the law, we think they are required as a matter of law to include our proposal in the proxy materials”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.450" offset="9679489">So now I come to the vital question in the case which is what does the Commission actually do in a dispute of this kind?</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.149" offset="9714284">The fact is that in practice, the Commission actually decides the proper legal issue on its merits, it takes the shareholder proposal which is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.793" offset="9760886">It holds it up against the very precise legal standards which are written out in the Commission’s own rules and it decides the legal status, if you will, of that particular proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.016" offset="9809788">And if you look at page 25 of the government’s main brief you will see confirmed the fact by a former Chairman of the Commission that they decide the status of the proposal under the Proxy Rules and essentially legal determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.008" offset="9873735">I might add that in Mr. Cluther Rath's survey of this whole situation, he recites decision after decision after decision by the Commission on the merits of the legal issue presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.919" offset="9929324">He does not identify a single case in which the Commission did not decide the legal issue on its merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.817" offset="9960984">Indeed, the government here has not cited a single situation in which the Commission did not decide that question on its merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.003" offset="9997660">And thus far, I might add, there have been five courts that have considered such Commission action and they all treated it as a decision by the Commission on the merits of the legal issue presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.552" offset="10051891">Now, in this case, the government, if I may say so, focuses on form and not substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.872" offset="10081148">They focus on the language of the letter which then came out of the Commission after they had resolved the issue against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.384" offset="10115211">Now, the language of the letter was that, they adopted the recommendation of the Division of Corporation Finance and on that basis would take no action against Dow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.583" offset="10167979">The emphasis that the government places here is on the no action language and they say what they speculate, that possibly, the Commission somehow bypassed the legal issue which had been argued to it by the parties and decided to take no action against Dow without deciding that legal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.839" offset="10253033">But I should emphasize they are speculating only as to what the Commission may have done, the government in this case has never come right out and the Circuit that the Commission sidestepped the legal issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.223" offset="10306532">And in any event, it seems to me that the sidestepping speculation, if you will, is pretty unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.142" offset="10334222">Obviously the Commission is not going to decide whether or not to take action against the company without first deciding whether the company is right on the law or wrong on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.313" offset="10386989">In fact as Mr. Cluther Rath's reports makes clear they always do decide the legal issue; if they decide the company is wrong on the law, they send the company a letter and say, “We think you are wrong, and we think that the law, that is, the proxy rules, require that you include this proposal in your proxy material”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.608" offset="10468073">On the other hand, if they decide the company is right on the law, they send out a no-action letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.439" offset="10491479">Now, that is what actually happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.921" offset="10505376">Now, let me talk for a moment about the practical impact upon the parties, when a Commission decision has been rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.591" offset="10540067">In a case where the Commission decides that the company is wrong on the legal issue, as a practical matter, the shareholder can relax, His worries are over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.043" offset="10581863">Faced with that position by the Commission, the company knows it has two choices, it can either bow to the Commission's ruling of the law and include the proposal in its proxy materials or on the other hand, it can ignore the Commission’s ruling but if does so, it faces very severe sanctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.880" offset="10661171">At the first place in that situation, the Commission can institute an administrative proceeding looking toward de-listing of the company's securities for violation of the proxy rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="2712.117" offset="10922186">In the entire history of the Securities Act, there has only been one company who ever declined to abide by the Commissions ruling, that was TransAmerican Corporation, they were probably sued by the Commission, they lost the case, that was in 1947 more than 20 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.377" offset="10991149">No company, since that time has ever defied the Commission’s ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.751" offset="11012674">In other words, no shareholder in history has ever had to take any action to defend his rights, once the Commission has ruled in its favor on that issue and I suggest that is entirely as it should be one of the principal responsibilities of the SEC is to serve as the guardian of corporate shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.279" offset="11094803">Now, I have discussed the shareholder who wins before the Commission but compare his situation with a fellow who loses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.531" offset="11127822">If the Commission, let us assume, erroneously decides against the shareholder in this dispute which they have brought before themselves, then of course that shareholder has been wrong and he suffers a number of distinct practical ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.171" offset="11198353">In the first place, he has been wrongfully deprived of the Commissions very effective help.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.004" offset="11225729">Secondly, if he wants to vindicate his rights, he must undertake the expensive litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2795.935" offset="11257389">Thirdly, in that litigation, wherever it occurs, the court involved is likely to give great weight perhaps even decisive weight to the Commission’s ruling, adverse ruling on the question of law involved.</text>
