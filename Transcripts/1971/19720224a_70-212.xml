            <label>Mr. John K. Mallory, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="63.819" offset="329008">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.743" offset="340710">This case is somewhat similar to the case just argued, here on appeal from the judgment of Supreme Court of New Hampshire, holding constitutional a New Hampshire State Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.301" offset="410928">The appellant airlines sought to enjoin enforcement of the statute which imposes on the airlines, this tax is imposed on the airline not the passenger, imposes on the airline a charge of $1 per passenger enplaned from New Hampshire airports.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.430" offset="503401">The airlines contended that the statute was unconstitutional under the constitutional right to travel, Commerce Clause and Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.365" offset="547182">The Trial Court in New Hampshire transferred the case, including stipulated facts to the Supreme Court without any -- without determining any issues as it can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.282" offset="598800">The Supreme Court in January 29, 1971 held a charge, it was charged on the airline, not the passenger and that it is not a “Service Fee” on common carriers of passengers for hire on a regular schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.906" offset="665360">That -- it held also that the incidence of the charge is on the enplanement of passengers, but it held that enplanement is a wholly intrastate event.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.968" offset="725546">It held the statute constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.359" offset="743101">The statute in New Hampshire as I have said imposes on the airline a charge of $1 per passenger for all passengers enplaning from the New Hampshire airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.696" offset="792420">If however a scheduled airline uses planes with a gross weight of less than 12500 pounds, it charges 50 cents per enplaning passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.968" offset="841530">Charter carriers, contract carriers or charter carriers, not scheduled airlines, of over 12500 pounds are similarly taxed and charter carriers with planes of less than 12500 pounds do not pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.100" offset="910075">The charge or tax on charter carriers ends when the funds contributed by the states -- by the state of New Hampshire to the airports has been repaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.549" offset="967858">The charge on schedule carriers has no terminal time.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.354" offset="991055">The collections from this charge or tax are remitted to the Aeronautics Commission, State Aeronautics Commission which distributes 50% of the funds to the state aeronautical fund and the remaining 50% to the municipality or Airport Authority owning the landing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.937" offset="1097426">There is no requirement that the municipality spend the monies received on airport facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.484" offset="1131594">Under the -- the municipalities must place in aeronautical funds, funds collected under Chapter 423 of the New Hampshire laws, but the revenue collected under this particular section that we are talking about is not collected under 423, it is collected under 422.</text>

            <text syncTime="491.108" offset="2038147">The court in New Hampshire, the Supreme Court, refused to follow Crandall and Nevada and the passenger cases, specifically stating that its reason for not following those were that those involved a tax directly on the passenger and not on the carrier as the court said was the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.472" offset="2155594">It also refused to follow the Montana case and distinguished the Indiana case that we have just argued, the Evansville case, again on the ground that there the tax was on the passenger and here it is on the carrier and it distinguished the New Jersey case which had been decided by the Trial Court and the state withdrew its appeal on the ground that there the statute allowed the monies collected to go into the general funds of the cities which didn't own the airports.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.373" offset="2291221">The court noted that in 1959, it had rendered an advisory opinion on a similar statute, but one applicable only to carriers engaged in intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.487" offset="2343675">It had upheld that statute and had noted in its opinion, in its advisory opinion that objection by anyone to the effect on interstate commerce was unlikely in view of the Aero Mayflower Transit case, 332 US and Terrell against Johnson, 86 New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.946" offset="2429461">We contend here that the New Hampshire Supreme Court erred in holding that the right to travel cases, including Crandall do not apply because the tax in New Hampshire is on the carrier rather than on the passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.112" offset="2490170">We contend that, that is an error of law in determining that the tax in New Hampshire was on the carrier, not the passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.276" offset="2522771">We contend that it also erred in failing to follow the Crandall line of cases because of its view that those cases were merely based on the theory of power to tax as a power to destroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.354" offset="2575120">We submit that it erred in holding that the act of enplanement, which it found was the incidence of taxation, is wholly an intrastate event.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.106" offset="6646147">In each one of those cases, the Court was met with the argument that here is a tax on the carrier, it's not the passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.965" offset="6677599">It's a use tax or it's a tax on the privilege of doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.348" offset="6695048">In each one of those cases the Court looked through that, and specifically held that as a legal matter, as a constitutional matter a tax of this type on the carrier measured by flat rate per head on the passenger is to be viewed for constitutional purposes as a tax directly on the passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.814" offset="6804972">Now the Supreme Court of New Hampshire ignored those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.043" offset="6821899">It didn't -- they were brief, it did not discuss them at all in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.482" offset="6851574">In the Passenger Cases, Chief Justice Taney in dissenting, but in discussing at the interstate, an intrastate tax, a tax on citizens moving from one state to another was also covered in those statutes and finding that that was unconstitutional specifically dealt with whether or not a tax of this type was one to be viewed is on the carrier or the passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.559" offset="6947914">And he held that it was stated that, it was on holding that it was to be viewed as a tax on the passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.261" offset="6974768">In Henderson against New York, the state was specifically trying to avoid the holding in the Passenger Cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.816" offset="7008936">And they made it absolutely clear that the charge was not on the passenger, but on the master gave them an alternative to post a bond or pay $1.50 for each passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.437" offset="7051463">New York argued in that case that the tax, the Act I am sorry, the Act to be passed now by the Court does not impose a tax on the passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.493" offset="7095662">The Act -- the state also argued that the Act cannot be tortured into an indirect mode of imposing a tax or duty upon the passenger as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.029" offset="7133801">The Court noted that argument and specifically stated, in whatever language a statute maybe framed its purpose must be determined by its natural reasonable effect, and if it is apparent that the object of this statute is judged by that criterion, is to compel the owners of vessels to pay sum of money for each passenger brought by them from a foreign shore and landed at the port of New York, it is as much a tax on the passengers, if collected from them, or a tax on the vessel owner for the exercise of the right of landing their passengers in that city, as was the statute held void in the Passenger Cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1877.614" offset="7584152">This particular case which we are discussing now, the New Hampshire statute, Chapter 391 is different from the previous case, at least in form and in fact I think it's different in substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.676" offset="7644443">Chapter 391 levies against a scheduled air passenger carrier, a service fee for the use of the state's facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.691" offset="7684462">Now I would like to make one point here that our airports in New Hampshire are very similar to the -- currently the Indiana airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.486" offset="7719675">We have three airport authorities with which we are concerned here and two municipalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.509" offset="7739737">But for the most part, the expense of the airport, the operating expense and to a large extent the capital improvement expense is carried directly by the municipality or by the airport authority by some sort of, in that particular situation a property tax for the most part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.827" offset="7812985">The Aeronautics Commission through -- the legislature does appropriate money for various activities at the airport, and the Aeronautics Commission has money that it receives through fees and so forth, which is expended to these airports.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.910" offset="7905354">However, this fee only affects at the present time five airports and before a fee is collected at these airports, it's a condition precedent, that both the state and the municipality or the airport authority contribute money to the operating expenses or construction expenses, not just one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.174" offset="8010366">The statute is set out, it is a levy against the carrier in it's terms, the Attorney General is authorized to -- in a civil suit to sue the carrier, if the carrier does not remit the service fee, returns are made by the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.198" offset="8086435">The proceeds are to go, 50% to the airport authority or municipality from which the fee is measured and 50% to the Aeronautics Commission or to the treasury to be covered into the aeronautical fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.902" offset="8161249">Now, this aeronautical fund can only be used for air navigational aids.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.988" offset="8181625">Now the money that goes to the municipality for the airport authority for the most part, I tend to agree there was not a restriction that it must be used for air navigational aids as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.114" offset="8230108">But as you look at the total picture, they are paying most of the bill to the airport anyway and the fee would never replenish the amount that they are paying out.</text>

            <text syncTime="2143.685" offset="8648381">Now the fee under the New Hampshire statute, the fee is against the air carrier for the use of state and municipally funded facilities, and it is measured by two criteria, the weight of the aircraft, and the benefit for right of the carrier in terms of the number of enplanements, or the number of people who would get on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.614" offset="8740123">I would like to go back to a question that was posed by Mr. Justice White and discussed further by Mr. Justice Blackmun yesterday, with regard to the Indiana case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.163" offset="8782337">And the question was, why not simply increase the landing fees?</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.100" offset="8810131">Now, the New Hampshire answer to that question, because it does seem like a far more simple thing to do without perhaps any constitutional problems, was posed to the Commission and their answer was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.954" offset="8873452">This would be an inequitable burden against the air carrier to simply double or triple the landing fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.592" offset="8912008">Now, the fact that we are opposing each other here and the fact that the state indicates that the fee is constitutionally airlines in the case that it is not, does not mean that there is not some harmony with the regard to the Aeronautics Commission and the airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.618" offset="8980136">We do not want to burden the airlines to such an extent they cannot do business in New Hampshire.</text>

            <text syncTime="2495.261" offset="10054709">I would agree with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.305" offset="10106954">With regard to the fact that this tax is levied against the air passenger carrier and against the contract carrier which is not in litigation here, there is particularly is good reason for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.853" offset="10173096">Number 1, that the carriers derive their livelihood, they use regulatory routes, they are in and out all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.167" offset="10206323">And secondly, all of the expansion in the New Hampshire Airports can almost be traced directly to the change of facilities of the air carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.898" offset="10249269">For instance, the DC-3, it was changed to the DC-6.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.179" offset="10262435">It needed a longer runway and now that I believe they are changing to a DC-9.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.111" offset="10290124">The change of facilities of the air carriers appears to be one step ahead of the change of the airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.673" offset="10328368">So most of the capital expense and a great deal of the operating expense is directly due to the fact that these airports are used by commercial air carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.743" offset="10376642">Number 2, is the safety devices that must be maintained because the cargo here is passengers, and this is -- although some safety devices of course would be there even if they had non-commercial flights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.825" offset="10425021">I think it would definitely be increased by the fact that you have the commercial flights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.527" offset="10451770">I think when this statute is analyzed, it is possible to look at it as a correct and proper use fee levied against the carrier measured by the weight of the -- measured by two criteria, the weight of the carrier, that is the wear and tear presumptively on the runway, and number 2, the benefit provided by the use of the facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.827" offset="10572978">Now the benefit might not necessarily be equivalent to the number of times they land, particularly in New Hampshire, or Laconia or Berlin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.412" offset="10607355">They may very well land and takeoff with no one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.623" offset="10620208">They may have not received a terrific benefit, they may land in Manchester and pick up more people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.680" offset="10644449">So the benefit here is and the fact number 1, the use, the wear and tear, the weight of the aircraft, and the benefit is reflected by actually the number of people that they pick up.</text>

            <text syncTime="2675.852" offset="10777047">It is our opinion and contention that this is a simple way to measure the benefit derived and it would be immaterial for instance whether we call it a deplaning fee or an enplaning fee, or a take-off fee or whatever because we're only using it as a yardstick to measure the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.752" offset="10864714">Therefore, in my opinion, it would be excessive for instance for us to tax the enplanements, and then tender a tax on deplanements and so forth, because the benefit would then be doubled and it would be out of proportion.</text>
