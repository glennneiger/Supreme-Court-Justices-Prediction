            <label>Mr. Boris H. Lakusta</label>
            <text syncTime="48.192" offset="266422">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.548" offset="287843">The -- the issue in this proceeding is whether the -- the facts in a treble damage antitrust complaint, constitute a violation on -- under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.670" offset="340401">In this case, a -- a group of 15 certificated motor carriers brought the complaint against a group of 19 motor carriers, certificated motor carriers, alleging that the defendant had violated the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.091" offset="414066">The complaint was amended and the first amended complaint is one with which we are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.376" offset="439144">I -- I shall refer to it simply as the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.017" offset="453772">We move to dismiss it on the ground that it fails to state a cause of action under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.472" offset="487627">Judge Sweigert of the Federal District Court agreed with our position and wrote a really extensive opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.762" offset="520750">In support of his views, he gave the plaintiff an opportunity to amend and they did not avail themselves about and instead appealed to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.732" offset="568607">The Ninth Circuit reversed by a 2-to-1 vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.333" offset="591072">The dissenting judge, Senior Judge Hamlin, wrote a separate dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.706" offset="616567">We then petitioned for a writ of certiorari to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.016" offset="637779">Now, I turn to the complaint and we'll summarize the -- the fact which it alleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.503" offset="667663">That alleges that these defending carriers got together in early 1961 and agreed on a program of protesting all certificate proceedings which might result in competition to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.195" offset="734432">All certificate proceedings brought before either the Interstate Commerce Commission or the California Public Utilities Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.748" offset="768705">The program was to include court review in the event the protest before the administrative body should prove unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.943" offset="809456">The allegation is that the defendants agreed to finance a program jointly, under an arrangement under which each carrier would contribute monthly, a sum based on his gross annual revenues, rather than according to his interest or participation in any given case.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.094" offset="898063">The agreement was that the program should be publicized to the carrier industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.493" offset="935679">The complaint goes on to allege that the agreement was carried out and has been carried out consistently since 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.550" offset="979879">As to purpose, the allegation is that the agreement and program were designed to reduce or eliminate competition and that to achieve that -- that anticompetitive result, the complaint alleges if we accept plaintiff's version, which I think we must, for purposes of this case, that in defendant's primary intent was to use the words of the complaint, to discourage and deter the plaintiff and others in like position from filing certificate applications or from pursuing those applications, was they did file.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.388" offset="1167229">In this connection, the -- the plaintiff say that defendants -- that the defending carriers intended to make as effective, a presentation in each case before the relevant commission as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.602" offset="1232117">In fact they recognized that such an intent was essential to the primary purpose of giving authority to the desire to discourage or deter plaintiffs and others in the like position from coming before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.841" offset="1309021">There's no -- there's no suggestion in the complaint that the defendants were, at anytime, guilty of dishonesty or deception.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.626" offset="1344234">There is no suggestion in the complaint that the defendant at anytime offers false or irrelevant testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.460" offset="1407555">I would like to turn now to the reasons why we believe the Sherman Act should -- should not be extended to the fact that's alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.442" offset="1447470">The two cases on which we chiefly rely are Eastern Railroad Conference versus Noerr, decided in 1961 by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.819" offset="1492923">It -- it was a unanimous decision and Justice Black wrote the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.682" offset="1520404">The other case since United Mine Workers versus Pennington, decided four years later in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.590" offset="1544019">Mr. Justice White wrote the opinion for the majority in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.024" offset="1565753">We start with a proposition in Noerr that a restraint imposed by Government is immune from the Antitrust Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.584" offset="1616012">That has been held in Parker versus Brown and U.S. versus Royal Rock.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.518" offset="1639732">It would seem to follow that -- reason to believe that the efforts to influence Government to impose such governmental restraint should also be immune from the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.162" offset="1694380">I think that is at least in broad terms, the -- the holding in -- in Noerr and in Pennington.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.187" offset="1722487">The joint efforts involved in Noerr were efforts to influence at least one state governor and more than one state legislature and also certain law enforcement agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.335" offset="1775046">The joint effort in Pennington involved joint efforts to influence the Secretary of Labor and officials of the Tennessee Valley Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.172" offset="1818409">Now, the Noerr case sets for three reasons for holding that the Sherman Act should not apply to these joint efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.619" offset="1852159">The first reason was essential dissimilarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.770" offset="1872744">In other words that appeals to governmental bodies are essentially dissimilar from a kind of -- of trade restraint which Congress had in mind when it enacted the -- the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.973" offset="1925616">The second reason given in Noerr was that there is indeed a -- a strong policy of Government to encourage the -- the free flow of information to governmental officials towards -- with adopting or imposing restrictive action.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.980" offset="2017567">The third reason given was that if the Sherman Act were extended to apply in -- in -- in these joint efforts, it would raise serious questions of whether the First Amendment right to petition would be jeopardized.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.271" offset="2078798">So the second reason deserves our particular attention, namely, the strong policy of Government to encourage the free flow of information to governmental officers charged with action, which may have a restrictive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.186" offset="2158419">The concept is that in such an area, the Government can do its job best in this very discretionary sphere, if it can call upon the information of members of the public who have an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.466" offset="2235532">It is and as noted in Noerr, it is those that a competitive interest who can be best counted on and certainly are the most motivating to furnish the very kind of information which will be of assistance to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.226" offset="2310556">And I suppose you to charge (Inaudible) that that should be true, but it is true that those with anticompetitive motive can often be most useful in assisting the governmental body to make its determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.634" offset="2372205">Mr. Khourie, counsel for the plaintiffs, recognizes that reason in -- in the Noerr case, but he says “And the doctrine should apply only to legislative and executive activity and in any event not to applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity for the general certificating process, engaged in by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Public Utilities Commission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="602.895" offset="2485263">He goes to great efforts to say that their activities are judicial in -- in nature and equates to the fact that certainly the procedures of those bodies have many, if the -- the overtones of proceedings before a court, the calling of witnesses, swearing of witnesses and the receipt of false evidence, which is not here and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.494" offset="2603650">Then he turns to the -- hereto say that what these bodies do is -- is to adjudicate in the realm of certification, then herein as to the patent cases, which he relies on very heavily for the proposition that efforts to obtain a restraint for the use of the judicial machinery maybe actionable under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.347" offset="2707095">I submit that the patent cases which in law of the grant of an absolute monopoly have little relevance to the case we have here and that all of them can be readily explained, if -- if -- to the extent they do present any conflict with the Noerr-Pennington doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.616" offset="2788179">Now, I submit that it is immaterial whether the action of the -- of the Utilities Commission or the Interstate Commerce Commission be described as adjudication or adjudicatory or by any -- any other name.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.544" offset="2843872">The pertinent question is whether the agency is substantially aiding by the kind of information which competitive interests can be expected to produce, if they are protected from the Sherman Act.I submit that the answer is yes, vis-à-vis, the ICC and the PUC.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.799" offset="2924852">So I -- to substantiate that I -- I point out what the certificate regulating function is.Senior Judge Hamlin, the dissenting judge of the Ninth Circuit, correctly characterized it as, “One, I can to policymaking”.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.118" offset="3010115">The concept of public convenience and necessity connotes a -- a very broad discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.061" offset="3041985">This Court has repeatedly said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.913" offset="3053374">The content can vary a great deal according to time and circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.851" offset="3073123">I would suggest that in practical effect, there is great difference between what I might describe as the public good standard, which a -- a legislature or a governor employs, when he makes a -- when he takes action of a restrictive nature and the public convenience and necessity standards which enable such the ICC or PUC applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.722" offset="3184613">The agency contract about Mr. Khourie would say, does not adjudicate rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.215" offset="3202585">There's no such thing as a right by carrier A to a certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.781" offset="3224842">On the contrary the agency is regulating in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.320" offset="3243023">And the grant or denial of a certificate is simply an incident to that overall regulation of one segment of the public utility industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.260" offset="3290775">Now, with such understanding of a certificating function, it is perhaps no surprise that protests from existing carriers are sanctioned and encouraged.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.090" offset="3346050">The Interstate Commerce Act and the Public Utilities Code, both contained provisions which indicate an anticipation that the protest and participation of competitors in the form of those already holding certificates shall be entertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.193" offset="3418461">Then very specifically, the procedures of the two agencies provide for the invention of competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.784" offset="3460780">That will be competitors is, so far the count for any permission goes at least, required to or entitled to receive notice of the application, if the application is for a certification in his area and such carrier is entitled to come in and protest and say his piece.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.053" offset="3545939">Indeed, it is customary both before the ICC and the PUC for groups of carriers to come in and protest as the defendant are alleged to have done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.349" offset="3591079">The only difference that I can see being that in this case, their program was a considered program to participate in all proceedings that came along rather than sporadically.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.664" offset="3636323">This leads me to comment on the concept of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.832" offset="3657012">The -- the complaint alleges that protests were filed in all cases and it goes on from the say thing to so say, “With or without probable cause and regardless of the merits.”</text>
            <text syncTime="910.823" offset="3716989">I suggest to Your Honors, that the concept of probable cause simply has no place in a proceeding which involves the issue of public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.530" offset="3763800">It is not the adjudication of a private right.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.799" offset="3776861">Probable cause is a concept which applies for instance in a -- a suit on the contract, involving the payment of money in a -- and most of the time, be determined very quickly, whether the complaint is frivolous or whether there is probable cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2029.255" offset="8190719">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.652" offset="8212349">I -- I think from Mr. Lakusta's remarks about the content of the complaint, it's certainly emphasized in my mind that a trial is needed in this case to determine what this plan embraced, whether it embraced as you posited this ad in the paper saying, “We'll sue anyone or whether it said in effect, “If you sue us, we'll defend on the good grounds.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.078" offset="8345991">Because although we admit in our complaint, in our brief, that no lies were told because we don't know of any.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.349" offset="8383085">We do not say that relevant information was given in all protest because many of the protests were made without any cost at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.266" offset="8434807">We've alleged this agreement was made in advance at one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.005" offset="8465736">In Coronado Hotel, in 1961, in San Diego which said that, “We will protest each and every application irrespective of what it is, where its location is, which is hereafter filed by any applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.194" offset="8550478">Now, I would like in a moment, if I may, to review the -- what I believe, the allegation clearly to say, but I think it's important that at least that I communicate to this Court that what the charge here is that there is an abuse of the processes by which Government receives information by these defendants for anticompetitive purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.912" offset="8689345">Now, the processes in this case are the processes which follow -- happens to be the way that was set up for certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.605" offset="8732081">The processes are in the judicial model.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.777" offset="8744829">We have filled our appendix perhaps over full with regulatory processes -- processes and rules which show that it isn't a judicial model.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.184" offset="8794461">And of course, it's the way that California and United States Congress and legislature has set up certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.301" offset="8822883">This is done because these are individually decided cases, based upon as Judge Browning said in the Ninth Circuit, “Standards of more or less generality,” but they still are individually-decided cases which much more are in the -- not in the political rough and tumble which is all I believe that Noerr dealt with and that all Noerr meant to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.719" offset="8956525">Now, the processes that I'm speaking of are not government action, they're self-actuated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.445" offset="8987454">In other words, just like all court processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.093" offset="9002083">You file a protest and things start happening without any Government official making any kind of a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.409" offset="9039281">And those things are things which cause delay and expense.</text>
