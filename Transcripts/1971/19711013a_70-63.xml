            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="24.305" offset="170902">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.111" offset="186157">This case is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and it presents a question involving the interpretation of the jurisdictional dispute provisions of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.923" offset="253344">Now, Section 8 (b) (4) (D) of the National Labor Relations Act, which is set out at page 3 of governments brief, makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization to strike or threaten to strike an employer for an object of forcing him to assign work to employees in a particular order labor organization or on a particular trade craft or class rather into employees in another labor organization or in another trade craft or class.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.086" offset="414049">Now, Section 10 (k) of the Act provides that whenever it is charged that any person has engaged in an unfair labor practice within the meaning of Section 8 (b) (4) (D), the board instead of immediately proceeding in the regular complaint of unfair labor practice fashion that it does with other unfair labor practice charges hold that unfair 8 (b) (4) (D) charge in abeyance because 10 (k) states that the board is empowered and directed to hear and determine to dispute out of which such unfair labor practice shall have arisen unless parties to such dispute, submit to the board, satisfactory evidence that they have adjusted or agreed upon methods for the voluntary adjustment of the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.024" offset="665765">Now, a board sense 10 (k) was added to the Act in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.534" offset="691783">As interpreted the phrase, “A party to such dispute to include not only the competing Unions, but also the employer who made the work assignment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="167.662" offset="744342">Hence, unless all three parties have agreed upon methods for the voluntary adjustment under the dispute, the board itself must determine the dispute under Section 10 (k).</text>
            <text syncTime="180.654" offset="796273">The Court below via a divided vote held that the parties to such dispute means only the competing unions and thus, since they but not the employers were bound by a voluntary method of the adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.270" offset="862728">The board had no power to re-determine the dispute under Section 10 (k) and correctness of this interpretation is the issue that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.011" offset="901703">Now, the underlying facts are briefly these.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.625" offset="928139">A Plasters’ Union picketed two different jobs in furtherance of its demand that the work of applying a code of Portland cement mortar to the walls, upon which tile was to be thereafter installed should be assigned to employees represented by the Plasters rather than to those represented by the Tile Setters Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.051" offset="1037853">The first job involved, in addition to our library at University of Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.280" offset="1062826">The general contractor of Southwestern had sub-contracted the, a Tile job to Texas State, a tile contractor employing the members of the Tile Setters Union and it sub-contracted the job of installing the tile.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.988" offset="1153628">The Plasters claimed the mortar work as theirs and when that claim was rejected by Texas State, the sub-contractor, they submitted the dispute to the National Joint Board for the Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes, a tribunal to establish by the Building Trades Department of the AFL-CIO and certain employer groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.498" offset="1263656">Both Unions by virtue of their affiliation with Internationals who are members of the Building Trades Department are bound by decisions of the Joint Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.384" offset="1323215">But neither Texas State; the sub-contractor, nor the Association, to which it belonged, had agreed to be bound by the decisions of the Joint Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.239" offset="1370653">The Joint Board awarded the disputed work to the Plasters finding that the matter was governed by a 1917 agreement, between the two International Unions and a 1924 decision interpreting that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.724" offset="1448603">Parenthetically, I might point out at this point that the whole dispute arose because of the development of a new bonding agents that were not discovered until 1950, but nonetheless the Joint Board awarded this work to the Plasters based on the 1917 agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.062" offset="1533971">When Texas State refused to change its work assignment in accordance with the Joint Board award, Plasters commenced picketing at the job site to force such a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.995" offset="1577648">Southwestern the general contractor filed charges with the board alleging that the picketing violated Section 8 (b) (4) (D) for the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.776" offset="1616727">The second job involved the re-modeling of the Rainbow Bakery.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.515" offset="1643685">There Martini, a tile contractor under contract with the Tile Setters Union was assigned the job of a installing the tiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.328" offset="1691019">The Plasters are claiming the work, began picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.820" offset="1720903">Again Martini was not bound by the procedures of the Joint Board and accordingly, it filed unfair labor practice charges with the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.407" offset="1767297">The Board's Regional Director finding a reasonable cause to believe that the charges had merit and finding that neither of the employers here at Texas State or Martini were bound by a voluntary method of adjustment proceeded to a 10 (k) hearing, at which all the competing Unions and the employers involved presented argument and evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.348" offset="1895088">It was a seven-day hearing in support of their respective positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.384" offset="1915254">The board on a basis of the records thus developed and in conformity with this Court’s decision in CBS which directed the board to consider all relevant factors and determining the jurisdictional disputes, so the board considered the collective bargaining agreements between the parties, employer area and industry practice, relevant skills and efficiency of operation, agreements between the two Unions and the Joint Board award on the basis of -- after considering all of these factors and the evidence adduced, the board concluded that employees represented by the Tile Setters rather than those represented by the Plasters were entitled for the work in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.765" offset="2120786">In short, it came out differently than the Joint Board had, which had awarded the work to the Plasters.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.977" offset="2149625">When the Plasters refused to comply with the board's determination of the work dispute, the Board’s General Counsel at that point issued the complaint upon the 8 (b) (4) (D) charge which had been held in abeyance in the expectation that the Section 10 (k) determination would have to settled the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.585" offset="2224022">It did not and under the scheme of the statutes you pick up the unfair labor practice into the case again, complaint issued, it went to the board, the board concluded that the picketing by the Plasters violated Section 8 (b) (4) (D) and it issued a cease and desist order, requiring the Plasters to cease this activity and to post appropriate notices.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.671" offset="2332377">As indicated earlier, the Court below refused to enforce the boards order on the ground that the board had no power to re-determine the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.379" offset="2375218">Now, as I indicated at the outset, the abstention clause in Section 10 (k) comes into play when the parties to such dispute, submit to the board, satisfactory evidence that they have adjusted or agreed upon methods were voluntary adjustment of the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.707" offset="2460482">Now, Congress did not define who the parties to the dispute were and it did not indicate whether dispute means, the underlying jurisdictional dispute or it means the dispute and the jurisdictional does a strike which has emanated from the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.017" offset="2537700">The Court below construed the term such dispute to mean merely the basic work controversy and it concluded that only the two Unions were parties to that dispute because in the words of the Court below, the employer in a jurisdictional dispute is a neutral caught in the crossfire between the disputing Unions, and unable to satisfy either.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.329" offset="2659013">He cares not how the dispute is decided, but once merely that it be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.616" offset="2688165">Now, we submit that therein lies the fundamental error in the Court’s reasoning, namely that the employer is necessarily a neutral party to a jurisdictional dispute.</text>

          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="713.842" stopTime="1076.424">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="713.842" offset="2929014">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.550" offset="2935910">It purported to find support for its position in this Court's opinion in CBS, where this Court did refer to a jurisdictional dispute as a dispute between two Unions, but we submit that no one would quarrel with that characterization as a general proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.927" offset="3025354">The issue in CBS was not this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.230" offset="3038624">This Court had no occasion to reach it because in CBS, none of the parties were bound by a voluntary method of adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.063" offset="3073942">The only question was conceding that the board had power under Section 10 (k), did it properly exercise that power when that merely rubber stamped the employer's work assignment and did not undertake to consider all the other relevant factors like in the (Inaudible) and in this Court had said that the board had to determine the dispute in the conventional way that an arbitrator would by considering all the factors and the board certainly complied with that obligation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.438" offset="3199434">Now, furthermore, in CBS, you had a somewhat a typical situation in that the employer there, employed both groups of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.756" offset="3260665">He employed state unions and he employed the technicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.171" offset="3282399">In that sense, in that kind of a situation, perhaps more so than in others, he is relatively indifferent as to which group does the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.980" offset="3325553">It is not the typical case nor is in the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.257" offset="3346660">In the typical case which is typified by the situation in the building contraction industry, the employer's economic interest will be directly affected by the assignment of work and thus in no meaningful sense and he said to be a neutral or indifferent as to its outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.405" offset="3431297">Indeed, John Dunlap, the first Chairman of the Joint Board has stated in a passage that we quote in our brief, the fact that some unions work exclusively as a matter of policy or custom for particular contractors factors tends to convert competition among contractors also into jurisdictional disputes between Unions, where apparently the dispute is between a contractor and a Union on one side against another contractor and Union on the other and this is certainly what we had in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.605" offset="3580090">Indeed in recognition of the employer's interest, the National Joint Board from its inception has included the employer groups in its structure and is operated under the explicit principle that an employer is not bound by its procedures unless he has specifically so agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.951" offset="3665458">Turning to the facts here, neither Texas State nor Martini has a collective bargaining agreement with the Plasters’ Union, and both had one with the Tile Setters Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.273" offset="3714777">Neither employed Plasters and a word of work to Plasters, would have required this contractors either to hire a new complement of employees whom they believe were less skillful and who is rates were higher than those of Tile Setters or to give up their sub-contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.394" offset="3791264">In these circumstances, it can hardly be said that Texas State or a Martini or a neutral as to how the work assignment dispute was resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.953" offset="3833478">Now, the Court below supported its reading of the statute by relying on the fact that the employer is not bound by a Section 10 (k) determination of a board, although, he is not a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.038" offset="3917801">Now, we submit in the first place that this fact does not lessen the employer’s direct interest in the resolution of dispute and relegate him to the status of a neutral; here is not how it is decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.709" offset="3984466">Furthermore, a Section 10 (k) determination in favor of the striking Union is enforcible against the employer in the sense that the Union is free to bring strike pressure against him because there is an unless clause in Section 8 (b) (4) (D), that accepts from the bond of 8 (b) (4) (D), a situation strike where the employer is failing to conform to an order or certification of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.704" offset="4128453">So that if the striking Union prevails in a 10 (k) determination and the employer does not comply with the award and reassign the work to it, it is free to bring economic pressure on the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.923" offset="4197416">So that in a very real sense there is pressure on the employer here to comply with the 10 (k) award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.752" offset="4236704">As a matter of fact, nobody is really found in a technical sense by a 10 (k) award because even the winning Union does not get the work in the sense that the 10 (k) determination requires the employer to change his assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.452" offset="4323430">All that it does is to give them a right to bring economic pressure as I have indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.698" offset="4348508">Now, the third support for the principle support for the Court below decision --</text>

            <text syncTime="1435.290" offset="5814813">The Court below, as I indicated found support for its position in the legislative history of 8 (b) (4) (D) and 10 (k).</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.114" offset="5870088">We submit that its reliance is misplaced because as judge Mackinnon pointed out in his dissent in the Court below, Congress really did not focus upon this particular problem in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.398" offset="5967264">We will find statements in the legislative history describing a jurisdictional dispute as a dispute between two Unions which is a truism that nobody would seriously quarrel with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.739" offset="6028599">They have their origin in a dispute between two Unions or between two employee groups, but it does not follow that the employer has no interest certainly where as must be the case before the board can get into the Act he has been implicated by a strike or a strike threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.905" offset="6133298">Secondly, the Court relies on the fact that Senator Morse who proposed a 10 (k) provision which as he proposed that gave the board the alternative of either deciding dispute for itself or appointing, an arbitrator, which was taken out of conference indicated that he felt that this would be inducement to the Unions as it was in the war labor board days to settle the jurisdictional disputes themselves, as you had hanging over them, the club of government determination of the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.410" offset="6311349">Now, we submit there is nothing in consistent between desire to have the two unions and resolve it for themselves on the one hand and on the other saying that if they are not able to resolve it by themselves, a binding of final determination cannot count if it excludes the employer which is the problem that we have here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1617.418" offset="6543316">As Mr. Come indicated in his argument, the real question here in terms of statutory language is what did Congress mean by who are the parties to the dispute which the unfair legal practice arouse.</text>

            <text syncTime="1653.429" offset="6687408">The factual circumstance was that the Respondent Union, the Plasters' representative sought and demanded the work in dispute here in a series of meetings over several months, after the employer had indicated that he would assign the work to the Tile Setters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.080" offset="6765984">The Tile Setters were the employees of this employer who were members of the Tile Setter Union.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.612" offset="11208159">Because you see Justice Marshall, if Congress had wanted to give him that sort of protection, they would have drafted 10 (k), so that he was bound by the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.997" offset="11253612">As it stands now, under Section 10 (k), the employer can demand a board hearing, he can demand a board hearing, I mean, a board order which is going to bind the unions, but which then the employer can completely ignore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.167" offset="11318291">Now, we think if Congress wanted to do which you suggested, they would have said, alright, Mr. Employer, you are now going to be bound by this 10 (k) award, but Congress was not about to adopt any form of compulsory arbitration binding the employer and the unions in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.599" offset="11392061">Now, we think that the language of Section 10 (k) supports our position very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.333" offset="11426960">The last sentence states, and we have quoted it in our brief on page 8, and our brief is the red one, “Upon compliance by the parties to the dispute with the decision of the board or upon such voluntary adjustment of the dispute such charge shall be dismissed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.700" offset="11508462">Well, as I just indicated, the employer does not have to be complying with the decision at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.520" offset="11535734">If the two unions involved comply the charge is going to be dismissed, the employer can go on making the assignment as he pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.804" offset="11564887">Now, clearly, if the employer does not have to comply, certainly the words parties to the dispute in that last sentence cannot include the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.818" offset="11620998">The first sentence also uses the same phrase, parties to such dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.694" offset="11644404">Now, again, if in the last sentence, it means only the disputing unions are labor groups, we submit, it cannot mean anything differently in the first sentence, but more importantly, the first sentence with regard to the word dispute, states and we have this quoted at page 10 of our brief, “The board is empowered and directed to hear and determine the dispute out of which such unfair labor practice shall have arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.996" offset="11765612">Now, the board in its brief and argument, has said, well, the dispute there means the jurisdictional strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.730" offset="11796645">We submit the dispute cannot mean the jurisdictional strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.115" offset="11814095">That the jurisdictional strike is the unfair labor practice and if you made a substitution of terms in that very sentence, it would read that the board is empowered and directed to hear and determine the dispute out of which such strike arouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.953" offset="11877520">The strike is the unfair labor practice and I think a short analogy would be in a discriminatory discharge case, that is an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.609" offset="11924123">The discriminatory discharge itself is the unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.960" offset="11941468">The unfair labor practice does not arise out of the discriminatory discharge and we simply cannot understand the basis of the board’s argument that the strike equals a dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.458" offset="11991519">And we also believe that this Court, in CBS answered that question and in answering that question, it was a necessary predicate to the Court's decision in CBS because I think I should go back a little bit prior to CBS, to recall just what the board was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.046" offset="12109906">For 13 years, the board, when it held the Section 10 (k) case, was simply determining the validity of the jurisdictional strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.520" offset="12155777">The board would state in its decision, whether the striking union was entitled to the work because of an outstanding board order, certification or collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.104" offset="12206141">If it was not, then the employer's assignment was affirmed every time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.863" offset="12225158">Therefore, the board was equating the dispute that it had to determine with the validity of a jurisdictional strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.166" offset="12254310">When the case came to this Court, Justice Black writing for the unanimous Court, very clearly and necessarily determined what the word dispute means in 10 (k) and if I make quote him and this is at the bottom of page 14 of our brief, “In the clause, the dispute out of which such unfair labor practice shall have arisen, can have no other meaning except a jurisdictional dispute under Section 8 (b) (4) (D) which is a dispute between two or more groups of employees over which is entitled to do certain work for an employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3106.204" offset="12498503">I believe Mr. Chief Justice that the way that it is written, referring specifically to the clause in Section 10 (k) that he is clearly talking about the use of the term in 10 (k).</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.733" offset="12548658">Now, of course in another situation not involved with 10 (k), dispute may mean something else, but this is why we believe that this question as to what dispute means in 10 (k) has been settled because the Court there was specifically referring to 10 (k).</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.682" offset="12636430">With regard to the voluntary adjustment or abstention provision of 10 (k), this Court in CBS also made reference to it and explained that the Court -- the board in the case before the Court then, had to hold a 10 (k) hearing because, and I am paraphrasing the Court, because the two unions, the technicians and the state (Inaudible) were not able to settle their dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.089" offset="12781984">The Court stated, and again this is quoted on page 14 of our brief, “Section 10 (k) offers strong inducements to quarreling unions to settle their differences by directing dismissal of unfair labor practice charges upon a voluntary adjustment of jurisdictional disputes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.628" offset="12876234">The Court of Appeals here recognized that once it had determined, what dispute is covered by Section 10 (k), the parties to the dispute for the purposes of the abstention provision necessarily means the two disputing labor groups are labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.162" offset="12974350">It can have no other meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.991" offset="12985635">Now, we rely of course, as I have stated on CBS and we submit that this Court in CBS, relied upon the legislative history of this Act and the thrust of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.399" offset="13051254">The Court, went into the legislative history, read it thoroughly and while we do not think a reanalysis is necessary here, I think briefly, I would like to say a few words about the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.773" offset="13128786">The House Bill, that was introduced in 1947, did not contain any provision similar to Section 10 (k).</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.066" offset="13169955">Section 10 (k) was introduced in the Senate by Senator Morse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.755" offset="13188658">Unfortunately in this particular situation, we have a very clear statement as to where the idea for Section 10 (k) developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.966" offset="13241530">Senator Morse explained in the legislative history, that while he was a member of the War Labor Board, one night, a very serious jurisdictional dispute occurred between two unions which resulted in a work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.873" offset="13309135">Senator Morse stated that the War Labor Board called the unions together and they told him to get the men back to work or if they did not, the War Labor Board was going to appoint an arbitrator to settle the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.755" offset="13368694">Now, the only fair reading from this point of the legislative history is that the two unions got together and settled the dispute because there is somewhat of a gap there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.399" offset="13407251">Senator Morse simply goes on to say, the men went back to work, but I think the only fair reading is that they got together, settled dispute then they went back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.382" offset="13443195">But in any event, Senator Morse then goes on to explain that he decided, the War Labor Board ought to have a policy to avoid these situations in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.996" offset="13489693">So, he proposed a resolution which became that policy, which said to the two unions involved, you have 24 hours to settle the jurisdictional dispute without economic action and if you do not, we are going to appoint an arbitrator to settle it for you and it is going to be binding on you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.072" offset="13562000">And if he explained, he wanted to get the same incentive into the Act and that is why he proposed Section 10 (k), which was adopted, almost completely the way he proposed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.812" offset="13628874">There is only one deletion and that is that Senator Morse proposed that if the two unions, excuse me, if the parties in the language of the statute, could not agree upon a settlement of the dispute, the board could hear the dispute itself or the board could appoint an arbitrator to hear it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.455" offset="13699509">The provision allowing the board to appoint an arbitrator was deleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.168" offset="13718317">It was deleted without comment in the legislative, in the conference, but we submit that we had a very clear statement from Senator Morse as to what the reason for Section 10 (k) was being put into the Act or being proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.387" offset="13787176">Other legislators, Senator Murray, for example, also echoed his hopes, that this provision, Section 10 (k) would encourage unions to set up machinery, to settle jurisdictional disputes themselves before the governmental action was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.212" offset="13878500">In affect then, Congress established the scheme for the settlement of jurisdictional disputes which resulted in work stoppages, which we think is clearly discerned from the statute and the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.805" offset="13948926">It has got four steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.544" offset="13955822">First, there is a jurisdictional dispute between two unions which results in a work stoppage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.230" offset="13986542">Congress said that work stoppage is going to be halted by a 10 (l) injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.424" offset="14007336">Second step; Congress proposed 10 (k).</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.051" offset="14021860">It said in Section 10 (k), we are going to have an opportunity for the two unions to get together and resolve their dispute, the abstention provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.986" offset="14061670">Step three; if the two unions or labor groups cannot resolve their dispute themselves, then the NLRB is going to have to make a binding determination of that dispute, in a 10 (k) hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.255" offset="14110676">Step Number four; out of the voluntary mechanism or out of the 10 (k) hearing before the board, one union will prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.547" offset="14155816">One union will go back and deal with the employer, will negotiate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.557" offset="14179953">Each will be able to use their own economic weapons at that point. Congress was not imposing substantive terms on either the unions or the employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.922" offset="14225406">Congress recognizes that what it wanted to do was to protect the neutral employer, the employer caught in the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.813" offset="14264903">The helpless victim, between the two warring unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.519" offset="14279741">The legislative history beginning even with the house statements and the house report, all show the Congress was concerned about the neutral employer, the innocent victim of the warring unions, the helpless victim caught between these two unions and as Justice Black said in CBS, the employer who is caught between the devil and the deep blue, that was the interest that Congress was trying to protect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.390" offset="14391231">That was its policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="4435.830" offset="17817034">At that point under Section 10 (l), the board comes along and gets some injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.329" offset="17838977">It then holds a 10 (k) hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4443.823" offset="17849008">At the 10 (k) hearing, it determines which union is to be allowed to use economic force, that is what the statute does.</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.987" offset="17881608">It is throwing out the inter union dispute in that as Mr. Capuano put it, stating which party will come back, will be allowed to use economic force, that is the only affect and that is why we think the government’s argument that 10 (k) is meant to settle jurisdictional strike is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="4470.994" offset="17957677">It is not; that is the exactly the argument that was made in CBS.</text>
            <text syncTime="4475.123" offset="17974186">That because the employer is not affected by the 10 (k) award, they have to give the work to the union that the employer wants to give it to, but that is not the point of the statute.</text>
