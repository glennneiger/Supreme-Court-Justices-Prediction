            <text syncTime="34.033" offset="209788">Mr. Wallace, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.049" offset="285856">Mr. Wallace.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="54.291" offset="290872">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.634" offset="308217">In this case, upon the challenge of the respondent, which is an operator of cable television systems in Missouri, New Mexico and Texas, the Court Of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held invalid, a rule of the federal communications commission, which provides that a cable television system having 3,500 or more subscribers may not in the absence of waiver of the rule by the commission, which is not stated in the rule but it had become clear in subsequent reports, may not distribute the signals of television broadcast stations unless it “also operates to a significant extent as a local outlet by cablecasting” and by having available “facilities for local production and presentation of programs, other than automated services”.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.935" offset="557425">The cablecasting simply means the providing of programming on the system, without the use of broadcast signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.002" offset="597654">Most cable television service does originate as broadcast programming of the system that brings in through its antennas.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.658" offset="636315">Cablecasting would be programming that it provides itself, rather than from broadcast services.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.117" offset="662124">The background of the rule is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.835" offset="677066">In June of 1968, this Court in the South Western Cable Company decision in 392 US upheld the FCC’s authority to stay cable transmission of distant broadcast signals into a community pending a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.794" offset="768913">The situation there involving the 100 largest television markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.261" offset="786780">The court held in that case that cable television systems engage in interstate communication by wire or radio within the meaning of Section 2(a) of the Communications Act and that the systems are therefore subject to the commission’s regulatory jurisdiction at least to the extent, that the commission's regulation is reasonably ancillary in the words of the court to the effect of performance of the commission's various responsibilities for the regulation of television broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.882" offset="945187">With uncertainties about the commission’s jurisdiction in regulatory authority over cable television thus dispelled at least to this extent, which I will argue as basically all we need here.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.791" offset="1016867">The commission has undertaken a major effort to integrate the rapidly burgeoning cable systems into the national communication systems in ways that will be consistent with and in furtherance of the public interest policy objectives of the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.858" offset="1101086">Since the decision in South Western, the commission has so far devoted more than three years of intensive study to cable television.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.617" offset="1148106">In a series of rulemaking proceedings, which began in December of 1968 with the notice of rulemaking, reprinted in the appendix, which resolved and the rule is at issue here.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="285.808" offset="1216965">That notice announced that the commission would explore “how best to obtain consistent with the public interest standard of the Communications Act, the full benefits of developing communications technology for the public, with particular immediate reference to CATV technology and potential services.”</text>
            <text syncTime="309.764" offset="1312782">Well, I think there is nothing expressed in the Act that says that a cablecasting as such is subject to the commission's regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.143" offset="1370251">Let's assume which, is true that a cablecaster carried no broadcast signals, he just originated programs.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="357.129" offset="1502222">Well under Southwestern, we don't think that that's limited to common carriers but this case no more in a Southwestern requires the court to reach that issue.</text>

          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="365.473" stopTime="378.619">

            <text syncTime="365.473" offset="1535554">But if there was some real statutory authority, obvious statutory authority over just wired communications, we wouldn't have had this argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.475" offset="1635551">Undoubtedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.689" offset="1644433">If the Act as you know, was enacted in 1934 and has not been amended on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.137" offset="1674212">The commission is proceeding as best it can.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="413.849" offset="1729069">Not at all, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.532" offset="1735861">In Southwestern Cable, the court reviewed the attempts to amend the Act that up to that time had occurred in Congress and noted that none of them had resulted in the adoption of any legislation, and since that time, there has not even been a bill considered in committee on this subject since the Southwestern decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.067" offset="1833977">But we think there is some significance in the close scrutiny that Congress has been giving to the development of the commission's rulemaking proceedings in this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.768" offset="1904717">The commission has submitted several written reports to Congress on its cable television rulemaking endeavors during the periods in Southwestern to the requisite congressional committees, mostly the communication, subcommittees of the two commerce committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.969" offset="1973575">And members of the commission have at times been quite closely questioned about these efforts at committee hearings and while this is certainly not dispositive of the case, we believe that it's significant because of this close scrutiny that there has so far been no substantial indication of any congressional dissatisfaction with the way the commission has been performing its task in this area.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="504.259" offset="2090709">Has it been -- it was the ordinary rulemaking function but has it been kind of a corporative effort with the -- trying to reach accommodation among the various competing interest.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="520.239" stopTime="696.557">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="520.239" offset="2154656">Well, the commission has devoted a great deal of time and effort to that covering various subjects in the course of these rulemaking proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.867" offset="2201154">I can broadly characterize them as the carriage of television broadcast signals by cable systems and the use of cable television channels for the distribution of non-broadcast programming, the main one at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.527" offset="2255802">But also a minimum technical standards for cable television systems, including minimum channel requirements, two-way transmission capability and separate neighborhood program origination centers and the whole question of the appropriate distribution of regulatory jurisdiction between federal and state and local levels of government, and question of limitation on local franchise fees paid by cable systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.768" offset="2380772">In the course of these proceedings over the past three years, more than 700 comments have been received from various industries, civic and academic groups and there were two lengthy realms of oral presentations and panel discussions held by the commission involving more than 200 participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.845" offset="2485053">One round in February 1969, before the orders at issue here were adopted and another realm in March of 1971, all together ten full days were spent on these hearings of panel discussions, and following the 1971 consideration, the commission in February of 1972 adopted a much more comprehensive set of rules on this subject than the rules at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.903" offset="2633324">We have lodged ten copies of these with the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.583" offset="2660073">And in addition to the reference materials that are cited in the briefs on the subject, there is a very lengthy and comprehensive article on the subject coming out in the forthcoming issue, the April issue of the Notre Dame lawyer which should be brought to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.221" offset="2770624">It's an article by Professor Steven Barnett of the University of California Law School which discusses very comprehensively the new rules and also the issues involved in the question of the commission's jurisdiction.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="700.596" stopTime="939.995">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="700.596" offset="2876054">That is correct, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.980" offset="2889638">You'll find after the initial part of it which is the report and order discussing them on Page 3278.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.013" offset="2929762">You have it with you there.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.183" offset="2938434">There's an index to the rules themselves which gives you some idea of the scope of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.066" offset="2993918">It might have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.861" offset="3005099">While Professor Barnett does take issue on policy grounds with some of the conclusions the commission has reached, he does say that his view -- there is jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.735" offset="3072599">Now the 1969 rules challenged in this case, have three general aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.119" offset="3114186">You get back to the rules at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.540" offset="3131845">And these were summarized -- this case is only under the 1969 rules which had three general aspects summarized in Commissioner Bartley's concurring state, concurring statement at the time of the adoption of the rules, that is in the appendix to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.062" offset="3221915">Great covered petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.827" offset="3232991">On pages 55 and 56, at the bottom of page 55 Commissioner Bartley very briefly summarized what was involved in the rules that were challenged in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.471" offset="3291610">One is the provision that a cable system may originate programs without limitation as to number of channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.303" offset="3322852">And beginning on January 1, any system with 3,500 or more subscribers is required to originate programs to a significant extent or else it's just forbidden to carry broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.816" offset="3376978">And then his B and C applied to the program originated, the cablecasting programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.219" offset="3414594">One was provisions that they may sell advertising with respect to such programs to be presented only at natural breaks or intermissions in the programs, and C is that this programming that they originate this cablecasting is required generally to comply with the equal opportunity and fairness doctrine provisions and sponsorship identification provisions of the Communications Act and of the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.490" offset="3547610">The respondent here challenged all three aspects, that the Court of Appeals held that the program origination requirement is invalid and then refused to pass on the validity of the remaining rules on the ground that the respondent lacks standing to challenge them since it did not intend to originate any programming, once the programming requirement, the origination requirement was struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.189" offset="3662444">So the only question before this Court is the validity of the origination or cablecasting requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.334" offset="3695045">The respondent correctly points out that no cablecasting was involved in the Southwestern case.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.114" offset="3734124">And I have already mentioned that the rule at issue here applies only to systems that carry broadcast signals, not to the presently nonexistent possibility of a system that does nothing but cablecasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.232" offset="3798594">So there is no need for the Court in this case to reach any question of the commission's jurisdiction over cablecasting as it stands alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.509" offset="4251766">It's not the primary purpose of the rule, but a substantial part of the cable systems obligations could be fulfilled by use of these services, and it's one consideration that we think should be taken into account with respect to the commission's authority here although it's not the basic, the heart of the commission's rationale here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.954" offset="4357510">All of the programs whether broadcast originated or not, are supplied by cable systems as they exist today to their subscribers over the same cable, and from the standpoint of the viewer turning the dial from one channel to another, cablecasting offered by the system is for all practical purposes undifferentiated from the other services being offered, and indeed from broadcast services that he receives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.848" offset="4497109">For this reason, we think it fairly clear that under the ancillary standard, reasonably ancillary standard of Southwestern Cable, the commission must have some authority to regulate cablecasting service because if the system were free to ignore its cablecasting, the fairness, equal opportunities, sponsorship identification requirements, that otherwise exist on the set, their overall effect would be quite seriously undermined and there is also the problem of the possible use of pay cablecasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.714" offset="4680593">This would be a per program or per service fee rather than just the subscription for hooking in to the cable, and the concerns of the commission has had about the siphoning off through pay television of programming that is now available free to viewers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.383" offset="5527273">And of course we contend that they do, but the question here is whether the commission had authority to apply the origination requirement to cablecasters, to cable systems that would prefer not to do any cablecasting, that is the issue here, and while we do not concede that the reasonably ancillary standard of Southwestern sets the outer limit of the commission's authority with respect to cable television.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.646" offset="5664260">Our position is that that standard is met with respect to the origination requirement also, which brings me now to the rationale of the commission which is at the heart of this requirement that they have imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.017" offset="5729775">This Court in Southwestern recognize the legitimacy of the commission's concern that local broadcast service not be destroyed or foreclosed by unregulated importation of distant broadcast signals on cable systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.154" offset="5806261">And there are two reasons for this concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.888" offset="5821203">One is the importance to the public of programming the deals with local issues of public importance which can only reasonably be anticipated on local service, and the other reason is the very practical problem that cable systems do not serve many persons in their area who are served by local broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.285" offset="5926842">Both because some of these persons cannot or will not pay the subscription fees, and because it is prohibitively expensive to extend the cable to those who are in rural areas or other sparsely populated areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.349" offset="6011061">The development of cablecasting on these cable systems however offers in the commission's view, compensating opportunities for service to the community that cannot otherwise be made available both because it overcomes the physical limitations of the broadcast spectrum on program diversity and because it offers new possibilities for specialized local service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.952" offset="6137494">For example, if you have a system that brings New York City signals into a small community in Pennsylvania as we do or you could just as well use a system bringing Denver signals into small communities in Colorado or in Wyoming as we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.633" offset="6216175">You have an illustration of the sort of thing that I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.452" offset="6231535">It may be that the ability of the local broadcasters to continue serving this small community and other small communities in the area will be threatened by the importation of these signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.699" offset="6300498">And perhaps other communities will also have their own cable systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.719" offset="6316589">But it is also true that the cable system which now they have up to 20 channels on the cable and provide many services to the subscribers in this local community that really can't as a practical matter be performed by broadcasters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.467" offset="6391509">Because they serve only a very local community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.736" offset="6408645">It’s quite possible for the two candidates for Mayor to have a debate on one of the cable casting channels or a panel discussion to be held on a local school board problems or other matters of particular local concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.706" offset="6472488">It’s even possible for small merchants who want only a local audience to advertise to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1884.293" offset="7610904">The considerations that the commission gave to financial arguments resulting ultimately in the waiver that they provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.769" offset="7640789">But the fact is broadcasters who do have to pay for networking and other programs that they receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.341" offset="7675061">And who do not receive any fees from their subscribes are all required by the commission to provide local service of a public interest nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.496" offset="7719678">And when it comes to the reasonableness of the rule, what the commission has done here is to say that cablecasters now have the capacity to provide additional kinds of local service that are not available through broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.032" offset="7773804">Should be required to do the same sort of thing when they have the financial capacity to do so and the commission has been very cautious on the question of the financial capacity rather than just exist in a parasitic relationship to broadcasting.</text>

            <text syncTime="1985.223" offset="8014549">And especially noting that more than 70% of the cablecasters now in existence now cablecasting, have less than 3,500 subscribers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.914" offset="8065331">And also in light of the flexibility of their rules, they're not required in order to meet this rule to engage in a high cost operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.185" offset="8106395">The chart on page 40 of the appendix to the petition indicates that it's possible to get down to what's called a small monochrome system or minimum monochrome system that is much less costly for those who don't really have the financial resources to do better.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.333" offset="8171074">And then if I may add references to pages 58 and 59, where the commission considered this further upon motions for reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.398" offset="8215273">And then finally, pages 66 and 67 of the appendix to the petition in which the commission setup procedures for waiver and said that any system with less than 10,000 subscribers when it applies for a waiver, will get an automatic stay until the waiver situation is clarified, until the waiver decision is made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2131.947" offset="8601468">Mr, Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.768" offset="8620798">Essentially a very simple issue is involved here, not the very complex issue that Mr. Wallace refers to because most of the things that he talks about are either rules and regulations that have been adopted since this case was before the court below as to which, the administrative process had not yet even been completed and the other aspect of which what happens with voluntary origination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.055" offset="8717869">The rules and regulations commission were not passed upon by the court below and not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.576" offset="8740021">What's involved here is the simple requirement of the commission that says to a CATV system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.041" offset="8761860">If you understand a business as a CATV system, you have got to originate programs, you got to become a broadcast station in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.765" offset="8792789">If you refuse to do that, you have got to cease being a CATV system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.113" offset="8810134">And I think it might be helpful if I just backed up a little bit and gave a little bit of history of CATV, so as to show how it fills in with respect to what the commission has done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.416" offset="8851303">CATV started when television broadcast stations were not able to fill in and provide service to their entire service area, principally communities located in valleys, where there are mountains in between the television antenna and the community whereas the television signal might extend for miles beyond this particular community, they were unable to receive the signals, television signals go line aside and the mountains cut them off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.270" offset="8966764">So individual entrepreneurs undertook to put an antenna on top of the mountain where the signal was available, capture it, bring it down by cable into the community and then to distribute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.331" offset="9015038">They started off originally, people doing it for themselves then making it available to their neighbors and they suddenly realized that when their neighbors came around that this was the sort of the service that everybody want to have and it became a business that they would charge people for the opportunity of being able to get television service that otherwise was not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.789" offset="9092883">And basically, while the rates for this service tends to vary throughout United States, mostly they are now between the low of $4 and a high of $6 per month for this service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.916" offset="9145337">As the institution developed, what happened was in some communities, they did have their own television stations but they maybe only had one or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.759" offset="9192775">By means of CATV, sometimes by bringing them the signals by high antenna or sometimes by microwave, you were able to bring in the three networks and maybe independent stations whereas people could get some free television in their communities from the one or two stations there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.999" offset="9261634">They were willing to pay this $4 to $6 a month for the ability to be able to get three-four-five or six signals which were distributed over the same cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.566" offset="9299982">Initially, the Federal Communications Commission paid no attention to this phenomena, neither did the broadcasting stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.712" offset="9324537">Quite to the contrary the broadcast stations were very happy with what CATV was doing because it was really filling out their service area in a way that geography and terrains had not intervened, the signal would be available and obviously the more people who are able to receive the signal, the better for the broadcast station because the broadcast station was able to sell advertising on the basis of a circulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.327" offset="9415025">But as this started to proliferate, and the commission initially even said, it had no jurisdiction on the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.480" offset="9439580">But as it started to proliferate, and as the importation of signals tended to create an economic problem for some of the existing television stations because obviously if you are the only television station in town, with no CATV, you have a captive audience, people either listen to you or don't listen anyone at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.718" offset="9512514">But when CATV brought in signals from two-three or four stations, it fractionated the audience. People were given the program choice, this is what the law and the policy of our government demands but obviously the local broadcaster was unhappy because he was losing his monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.175" offset="9570402">So he began to complain to the commission about this process and the commission undertook to regulate CATV systems to the extent that they imported signals and they adopted basically two types of rules and regulations on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.629" offset="9624214">One was a rule and regulation that said, that a CATV system must carry all local signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.205" offset="9654516">In other words, if the signal is locally available in a community, the CATV system must put it on its system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.986" offset="9681683">Now this seems self-evident but at least at the outset, when CATV systems got started and when capacity on CATV system was rather limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.211" offset="9726509">The local station many time would not particularly (Inaudible) and the CATV system would bring in signals from outside, that were more salable and the local station therefore would tend to have difficulty in getting an audience because once a person was on a cable, if the local station was not on a cable, that subscriber would have difficulty in getting a local station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.162" offset="9810310">So the commission said as a minimum matter, you must carry all local signals so as to make sure that the local station does not effect us and certainly the commission said that we will restrict the importation of distant signals because since distance signals come in to the market and tend to fractionate the audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.152" offset="9878333">It might cause a problem so far as the local station is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.233" offset="9898604">We will restrict it to make sure that you don't overdo it, we will undertake to strike a balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.692" offset="9920442">So as to make sure that you do -- you are able to bring in enough signal so that when added to the local signals, people get adequate service and by that they generally meant that they are able to get service at least from the three networks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.626" offset="9968194">But beyond that they wouldn't permit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.842" offset="9977076">That was challenged and ultimately this Court in Southwestern did sustain the authority of the commission to adopt such rules and regulations because these rules and regulations were ancillary to the commission's authority with respect to broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.336" offset="10039038">CATV systems, the commission held and this Court agreed, are engaged in communication by wire or radio within the meaning in the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.923" offset="10069340">Now, while they are not broadcast station themselves, they are instrumentality medium and in purpose of --</text>

            <text syncTime="2765.613" offset="11136181">We think it's very clear, that Congress has not given the FCC authority with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.389" offset="11163244">What Congress did give the Commission authority so far as reception activities are concerned is that you can adapt rules and regulations, that are reasonably ancillary to your regulation of broadcast station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.542" offset="11211832">And for example, with respect to your mandatory carriage of all local signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.866" offset="11233148">Since the commission in Section 3, 303(a), and 303(h) of the communication provides that the commission has the authority to classify radio stations and to prescribe the areas to be served by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.768" offset="11280795">Well, obviously it's ancillary to that jurisdiction says the court for the commission to require local CATV system to carry local signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.603" offset="11316113">Because if they don't, the area that the commission has prescribed for a broadcast station, is cut-off by the same token when the commission says that you shall not import distant signals beyond where they are intended to be carried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.978" offset="11369611">For example, if you are operating a system that cast for Wyoming and you’re trying to import a signal from Denver, Colorado, you’re obviously extending that signal beyond the area which the commission had prescribed which that station is to be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.899" offset="11429275">The commission under certain circumstances do permit those signals to be imported, but permitted only for the purpose of making sure that the people in Riverton, Wyoming have enough reception services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.380" offset="11479221">So that was the theory upon which the commission upheld authority in the Southwestern case because it was reasonably ancillary to broadcast jurisdiction over television station.</text>

            <text syncTime="2886.818" offset="11621014">Now a CATV system, in this essence is a very, very simple matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.391" offset="11643270">It erects an antenna, cables come down, distribute it to the people who paid $4 to $6 a month for that service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.074" offset="11673990">The pertinent is relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.072" offset="11686006">The personnel involved in it are relatively few in number and unsophisticated personnel, the people that string cables or maintain cables, will hook up television receivers and a small billing department that goes out and bills the people $4 to $6 a month and collects it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.240" offset="11750686">Now the commission comes along and says, CATV operates in many small communities that don't have their own television stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.452" offset="11783495">Wouldn't it be nice if those communities had television stations? And therefore the commission said that if you’re going to stay in the business, since you are using broadcast signals -- if you're going to stay in the business of providing broadcast stations, we want to know, we want, we demand that if you have 3,500 or more subscribers, that you must also become a broadcast station and that's what cablecasting needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.833" offset="11864998">You must become a broadcast station, you must originate your own programs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3011.956" offset="12121520">The commission went to Congress, to get a statute passed that says if you manufacture television receivers you must make sure that they have all the channels.</text>

            <text syncTime="3303.120" offset="13286163">The innovative question that Mr. Justice White asked and is really the novel case is, as to what is the nature of the undertaking of the commission's jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.721" offset="13332557">I would like to address myself to the quintessence of the question that we use broadcast signal, because it's an implication, not only an implication a direct statement to commission, that there is a benefit conferred that since we used broadcast signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.749" offset="13388668">But basically, this is not a parasitic or an exploitation relationship, it's a symbiotic relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.275" offset="13422836">Broadcast signals when they are transmitted over the year are worthless unless there is something on the other end to receive and then making use of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.644" offset="13448227">We are just as much a part of it, not as a recipient of the benefit, but as a part of the symbiotic processes as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.309" offset="13478947">We are no different than the sale, than the local dealer, that makes television sets to make them available to the people so that they can receive the broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.941" offset="13521474">Obviously, if no one will make them broadcast, there would be no market facets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.280" offset="13542790">But by the same token, if no one were making sets there would be no purpose in transmitting signals over the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.790" offset="13564838">It's a duality of the process, to tell us that just because we utilize broadcast signals in a manner in which they are intended to be utilized, and in a manner which unless we did something with them, they wouldn't be useful at all, that therefore we should now undertake to become a broadcast station in effect as to be able to tell the manufacturer of television receivers or the sales or television receiver, since you are making use of broadcast signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.769" offset="13672775">You want to do some, you want to go in and open a broadcast station in your town.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.660" offset="13700361">We are undertaking positive process, the commission has certain jurisdiction over one part of process and another type of jurisdiction over the other part of the process, but no where has the Congress given the commission the power to say that if you do part of the process, you also must do another part of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.862" offset="13769115">And this is, it's like in the case of Frost &amp; Frost (ph) where we cited in effect where the State of California told this gentleman if you want to use our road, you've got to be not just a private contractor for hire, you must be a common carrier for hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.260" offset="13842780">And the Supreme Court said, no, you can make reasonable regulations relating to the use of the road, and you may have even forbid the use of the road, but you can't say that if you utilized the road, you can at the same time, say now since you are utilizing the road, you have become a common carrier even though that's not what you intended to dedicate your property to.</text>

            <text syncTime="3502.308" offset="14082898">Now if Congress had said that this whole business of installing, as a new business okay, that if you install and so forth, that as part of that, there ought to be certain responsibilities to it, that could be another matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.567" offset="14135979">But so far as our function is concerned, and as this Court pointed out in Fortnightly, true from a copyright point of view, what we do is perform the reception part of this, and not the transmission part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.442" offset="14183417">It's an entirely different activity that they are asking us to do, it's not like the broadcast station, when a man who enters into operating a broadcast station must operate in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.891" offset="14221242">But at the same -- what they can do the analogy is – they say, if you got to be a CATV system, you got to be a CATV system which means you got to carry the local signals, means you got to carry them in such a way as not to degrade them, that you must meet certain technical standards in your operation of a CATV function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.610" offset="14284145">We have no problem, that's the business where in it's legitimate and severable business, and the commission can lay down rules and regulations that if we enter the CATV business we must do it, in appropriate manner, and that's what Southwestern was all about.</text>

            <text syncTime="3572.794" offset="14364916">I don't see how it's ancillary to the broadcast function to tell us that we must become a broadcast station in effect in a way that might yield benefits to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.428" offset="14411414">But it does not help the broadcast stations in any event to have us become a competitor by originating problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.934" offset="14453419">The whole theory of regulation, even in a broadcast field, those of us who come from small towns who don't have any broadcast stations -- we'd love to have had broadcast station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.529" offset="14499812">The commission has never had the power to say to someone that you've got to go in, and operate the broadcast station in that particular town.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.616" offset="14524158">They will say, if you want to operate a station in that town, you have got to live up to certain rules and regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.114" offset="14542131">But the affirmative requirement that tells someone that he must operate a broadcast station is really what's involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.969" offset="14565536">That's imposing a duty on difference of time, not just of decree, not just a definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.474" offset="14591554">They can tell us how to operate a CATV business, the quintessence of a CATV system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.893" offset="14617259">But when they say beyond that, you now must undertake to operate in addition, a broadcast station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.563" offset="14643904">The correlative of this would be, when in the area before there was an old channel law that is to say, when people were operating either VHF or UHF television stations and the commission said, television is not getting its maximum potential for the simple reason that there aren't enough either cheap receivers out or there aren't enough receivers outstanding that are capable of receiving UHF and therefore as a condition of operating your television station, we insist that you go into the manufacturing business and manufacturer receivers, so that people around to be able to receive those signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.219" offset="14778591">And not only didn't the commission undertake to do that with respect to broadcast as I mentioned earlier even with respect to manufacture, to manufacturing receivers it took a specific enactment of Congress to enable the commission to be able to tell the manufactures that in order to engage in this business your receiver must carry all channels, and not just the channels that you want to put on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.203" offset="14882454">When the commission adopted these rules and regulations which says that you can't have the luxury of carrying only distant signal that if you got to be a CATV system, you must carry local signal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.998" offset="14929683">That was enabling them to regulate the business that we have gone into perform and a recipient function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.967" offset="14965523">If they say that the signal must have a certain quality to make sure that the public gets the same quality of signal on their set that's been transmitted by the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.035" offset="14997811">That also is part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.949" offset="15005438">But to say in addition, that we must become a broadcast station is in effect -- the analogy that we cite in our brief like the distributor of the New York Times in Washington for example, is performing a function, he is taking advantage of newspaper function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.575" offset="15068028">If some local authority said that in return for that privilege, we don't think there is enough local newspapers in town, we think that you ought to publish a local newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.575" offset="15103972">This is what the commission is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.833" offset="15113063">We are not arguing with the desirability of the function.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.095" offset="15126020">What we are saying is under our system of regulation that this volition that goes into business, that you cannot be compelled to dedicate your property to a business that you don't use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.665" offset="15164367">That you -- that when you enter a business you are subject to rules and regulations, and if we voluntarily originate so far as this case is concerned, we can't originate and fail to comply with the same fairness, equal opportunity (Inaudible) law that does a broadcast station.</text>

            <text syncTime="3809.552" offset="15311907">But what we are arguing is it's not within the statutory jurisdiction to compel us to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.305" offset="15338865">I do want to mention one further fact it's not crucial to the case, but Mr. Justice Douglas had asked whether there are any grandfather rights with respect to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.139" offset="15374287">The grandfather right is not applicable here, this is applicable all CATV system no matter when they started.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.909" offset="15401350">The grandfather rights that the commission had recognized in this field, pertained to the situation that you are permitted to continue to carry the broadcast signal that you did before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.217" offset="15434578">But no grandfather protection has been recorded in this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.137" offset="15446281">We don't think that's crucial because we think the statutory jurisdiction is lacking for new system as well as old system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.239" offset="15470627">But I didn't want the record to be vague on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.380" offset="15503228">In summary, the position that we have taken is that as a matter of statutory authority, the commission is authorized to regulate broadcast station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.469" offset="15543561">They are authorized to regulate CATV system only to the extent that's reasonably ancillary to broadcast function, and that relates to the type of rules and regulation as to carry the broadcast signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.204" offset="15586506">We do not argue because it's not involved as to whether if we undertake voluntary origination that we are not subject to the same rules and regulation, as are applicable to broadcast station that is not before the court, we are not contesting insofar as this record is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.212" offset="15650558">We do say though that we cannot be compelled to enter into a brand new and entirely different kind of business as a condition of performing the function, or making the signals available that are dedicated to the public, by taking those signals and putting them to the use for which the dedication was contemplated.</text>
