            <label>Mr. Walter H. Mayo, III</label>
            <text syncTime="27.709" offset="184478">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.790" offset="200779">This is a direct appeal from the decision of a three-judge District Court for the District of Massachusetts, declaring invalid on First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds, the oath required of all state, county and municipal employees in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, but the facts are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.409" offset="271309">Very briefly they are that the plaintiff was hired as a research sociologist at the Boston State Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.362" offset="295133">She was on two occasions asked to take the oath required by the statute, and on both occasions she refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.696" offset="324495">There upon, she was advised that she could no longer continue her employment at the hospital and the compensation could no longer be paid to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.844" offset="361066">Several months later, plaintiff commenced her civil action in the District Court in which she sought a declaration as to the oath’s constitutionality and damages by way of back pay and for breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.190" offset="414460">The three-judge court received the stipulation of facts and her arguments of counsel and there upon entered a judgment and injunction declaring that the oath did violate the provisions of the First Amendment of the constitution, but they denied the plaintiff's claim for damages and back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.014" offset="485722">Both the plaintiffs and the defendants appealed to this Court in the 1969 term, and in response to the defendant’s appeal, the plaintiff maintains that that appeal was moot because of a particular job slot for which she had been hired at the Boston State Hospital had been filled subsequent to the District Court’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.413" offset="559283">The defendants resisted this suggestion of mootness by filing an affidavit of the hospital superintendent, but nevertheless this Court vacated the judgment of the District Court and remanded to that court with directions to determine the question of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.040" offset="613827">At the hearing on remand before the District Court, the three-judge court received an additional stipulation of facts, and heard oral evidence on the question of damages which it had advised that it would reconsider and at that hearing, the plaintiff retracted her suggestion of mootness which had been made earlier to this Court on the preceding appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.160" offset="690313">There upon, the three-judge court reinstated its judgment and injunction continuing to deny the plaintiff, a claim for damages and back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.041" offset="725840">Now, this time only, the defendant’s appeal, this Court has noted probable jurisdiction and we are therefore here on the narrow issue of whether or not the Commonwealth of Massachusetts may require all of its public employees an oath that they swear or affirm that they will uphold and defend the constitution of United States and of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and further they will oppose the overthrow of the government of the United States or of the Commonwealth by force, violence or any illegal or unconstitutional method.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.826" offset="881007">How do you characterize the District Court’s opinion here?</text>
            <text syncTime="204.498" offset="891665">Is it based on the First Amendment grounds or on the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment grounds?</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter H. Mayo, III</label>
            <text syncTime="209.583" offset="912041">Well, the District Court did not mentioned the Fourteenth Amendment in its original opinion on the constitutionality issue and based it entirely on the First Amendment and I believe by virtue of the fact that the First Amendment is applicable to the states or the Fourteenth, we must also characterize it as being a First and Fourteenth Amendment question.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.763" offset="988736">You said that this is required to all employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.070" offset="997931">The fact is that it is not required of all state employees because physicians or nurses in a hospital or other health care institutions, are not required to take such an oath if there (Inaudible).</text>

          <turn speaker="walter_h_mayo_iii" startTime="255.889" stopTime="257.557">
            <label>Mr. Walter H. Mayo, III</label>
            <text syncTime="255.889" offset="1097197">No, no equal protection argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.557" offset="1103884">You do not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Walter H. Mayo, III</label>
            <text syncTime="258.197" offset="1106496">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.675" offset="1116318">Plaintiff’s challenge in the District Court was first to the entire oath and the District Court considered this challenge and found plaintiff’s analysis of the language of the first portion of the oath that one will uphold and defend the constitution of the United States and of the Commonwealth to be esoteric.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.746" offset="1180684">It said that they could not adopt that argument because any argument after that portion of the oath, had been foreclosed by this Court for carrying an affirmance in Knight versus Board of Regents.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.965" offset="1221539">As to the second portion of the oath, the District Court agreed to plaintiff in one respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.996" offset="1241601">It observed first that plaintiff’s argument, as to this point is equally esoteric, which if the Court would follow it, would make almost any sentence in the English language ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.573" offset="1279949">However, the Court went on to find the phrase “oppose the overthrow” fairly vague because in the Court of Appeals, the word ‘oppose’ had at least two common meanings, and it therefore concluded the First Amendment was violated in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.568" offset="1331985">Although, the District Court did not suggest in its opinion just how plaintiff’s rights under that amendment were infringed.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.303" offset="1362914">Now, it is the defendant’s position in this Court that the oath survives all Constitutional tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.741" offset="1384648">First it is not void for vagueness and its provisions are easily understood and are intelligible and further even assuming for the purposes of argument that there are some ambiguities in the oath, but the oath is not thereby invalidated because its provisions do not affect or infringe any of the plaintiff’s First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.981" offset="1457582">As to vagueness, we believe that the oath as a whole should be examined to determine what meaning is reasonably conveyed by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.964" offset="1489556">The oath should not be separated word by word and examined under microscope.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="358.440" stopTime="367.236">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="358.440" offset="1507423">Mr. Mayo, I did not demean in my question to ask you, if you are making that Equal Protection argument on that, do you understand that your brother on the other side makes one?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="walter_h_mayo_iii" startTime="367.236" stopTime="409.060">
            <label>Mr. Walter H. Mayo, III</label>
            <text syncTime="367.236" offset="1542637">No, I do not believe so Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.589" offset="1559982">Viewing the oath as a whole, we think that it is a promissory oath of the constitutional support which requires action in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.869" offset="1593105">The portion which requires “One to oppose the overthrow” as a corollary of the first portion which requires one to support and defend the Federal and State Constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.593" offset="1632080">But the support to Constitutions is at the same time to oppose the overthrow the constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.980" offset="1653605">The second portion therefore clarifies the first portion and delaying the employees' obligation under it and the second portion can also be said to test whether the first portion of the oath is taken without mental reservation or for purpose of the reservation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="409.060" stopTime="436.107">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="409.060" offset="1709925">Let me ask you Mr. Mayo, under this oath as it is traced with reference to defending, a person could have a private belief, philosophical and political belief of communism and still conscientiously take this oath to defend against those to overthrow the government, could he not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="walter_h_mayo_iii" startTime="436.107" stopTime="437.408">
            <label>Mr. Walter H. Mayo, III</label>
            <text syncTime="436.107" offset="1818072">That is correct Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="437.408" stopTime="444.532">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="437.408" offset="1823296">So in that part of the oath, it is not a case involving belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.178" offset="1846388">Is that correct?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="walter_h_mayo_iii" startTime="444.532" stopTime="569.868">
            <label>Mr. Walter H. Mayo, III</label>
            <text syncTime="444.532" offset="1851822">And we would maintain the second portion of the oath likewise.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.064" offset="1861957">There is no question to belief which entered into the determination on this point, but there is certainly no question with beliefs in the first portion of the oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.095" offset="1910023">Now, whatever maybe the contention is on the vagueness question, and even assuming those questions to be colorable as with Mr. Justice Harlan when the case was here on the prior appeal, we think that on the examination of the effect of the oath on First Amendment freedom dispels any doubt that any of the plaintiff’s freedoms under the First Amendment are infringed by the oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.908" offset="1997272">First of all, the oath is far different from those oaths which had been struck down by this Court in Baggett, and in Elfbrandt, and Cramp.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.309" offset="2026947">Now, the oaths in those cases required specific disclaimers of affiliation with so called subversive organizations, and the instant oath has no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.759" offset="2064668">In our view, it is a forward-looking promissory oath of constitutional support that does not require a statement of belief which is a crucial distinction between this case and the Connell case decided by this Court last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.695" offset="2112419">No statement as to one’s belief at the time he is asked to take the oath is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.741" offset="2132586">The oath does not describe freedom of association, for an employee is free to join whatever organizations or political parties he desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.961" offset="2165500">The oath does not prohibit membership in any organization or political party, nor does the oath infringe on anyone’s religious beliefs or associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.835" offset="2208968">For instance, if an employee is prohibited by reason of his religious group (Inaudible), he might qualify the oath in that regard and I might add that such a qualification was approved by the Attorney General of Massachusetts in 1967, in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.952" offset="2273438">In short, we think that none of the plaintiff’s First Amendment rights are infringed by this oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.384" offset="2303218">Now, plaintiff attacks in this case things and the names to be concentrated on very speculative and conjectural possibilities concerning speech and association in the event of a possible overthrow of the government.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="569.868" stopTime="598.381">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="569.868" offset="2353164">They declare to you that the phrase “by force, violence or by any illegal or unconstitutional method” modifies or overthrow rather than oppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.372" offset="2423172">As a matter of pure grammar, you can read this is the same as “he will oppose the overthrow and he will oppose it by force, violence or by any illegal or unconstitutional method?”</text>

          <turn speaker="walter_h_mayo_iii" startTime="598.381" stopTime="607.277">
            <label>Mr. Walter H. Mayo, III</label>
            <text syncTime="598.381" offset="2467162">No, I think Mr. Justice Stewart the language modifies the word “overthrow” and not the word “oppose.”</text>
            <text syncTime="603.111" offset="2486075">It is the “overthrow by force, violence or any illegal or unconstitutional method.”</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="607.277" offset="2502793">As a matter of grammar which you read it, it could be read the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.288" offset="2522855">He has an obligation to oppose the overthrow by force, by violence or by any illegal or unconstitutional method, any way just to oppose the overthrow of the government?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="walter_h_mayo_iii" startTime="625.252" stopTime="794.214">
            <label>Mr. Walter H. Mayo, III</label>
            <text syncTime="625.252" offset="2574682">No, I could not agree, as the rule of grammar, that it would modify the word “oppose” because I do not think that an employee would use any illegal or unconstitutional method to oppose the overthrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.158" offset="2622330">I do not believe that would be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.692" offset="2644481">Now, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts does not believe that remote conjecture can suffice to invalidate the oath on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.097" offset="2674052">Now, what is required in this case to reach such a determination is a readily apparent constitutional infirmity.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.152" offset="2698294">In other words, it must be clear beyond third dementia that the oath will restrict the plaintiff’s First Amendment freedom and a precise identification of those freedoms must be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.899" offset="2737268">The Court must be able to say that the inhibiting effect on speech or association is real and not illusory and we submit that such an inhibiting effect cannot be gleaned from the extremely remote possibilities as to what plaintiff maybe required to say or do in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.151" offset="2802261">Now, plaintiff goes on to argue that the due process clause invalidates the oath because it requires a summary dismissal without a hearing, cited in the Connell case decided in the last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.500" offset="2843639">Again, the crucial distinction between the two cases, is that Floyd which was considered by this Court in Connell contains the word “Believe,” I do not believe in the overthrow of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.675" offset="2892331">And the opinion of this Court required Floyd to hold a hearing ascertaining suppose whether the beliefs are are firmly held prior to a final discharge of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.776" offset="2936739">In the case at bar there is no necessity for such a hearing because there is no factual inquiry to be made since the oath involves only promises of future action, a hearing in this regard would be meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.175" offset="2986372">Either a person takes the oath or he does not and such a determination can easily be reached without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.714" offset="3016570">In this case, I would note, that the Court is confronted with a record that it is absolutely barren of any threat of prosecution to perjury or any hint that plaintiff would be discharged for a failure to live up to the terms of the oath, and in fact since the oath was enacted in 1949, no prosecutions have resulted and no public employee has been discharged for failure to perform his obligations under the oath, and therefore, we think that plaintiff is here as to the infringement of her First Amendment rights, under the circumstances are simply without foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.015" offset="3149690">We think that the case can be succinctly summarized in the words of Mr. Justice Harlan who said when the case was here on the earlier appeal subscribing to the oath’s objectiveness to Mrs. Richardson to no more than an amenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.757" offset="3208726">The defendants would ask that the judgment of the District Court be vacated, this case be remanded for that Court, with direction to dismiss the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="888.781" offset="3628775">Well, the oath specifies “I will oppose” I would argue that that requires an affirmation of the time the oath has taken, the instance that the potential employee or is it just as someone about to take the witness stand in a trial will be required to swear to the truth of what he is about to say, that he intends from that time or forward, to act in conformity with the words which he repeated.

            <text syncTime="980.598" offset="3996057">Well, I have tried to suggest that I feel it is more than conduct insofar as it does require, if the oath has to be taken, it has more than amenity and clearly there are those who like my brother Mr. Mayo feel that it is only an amenity, but if it is to me more than an amenity, it has got to comport with your belief at that time as to how you govern your future conduct and of course we just believe in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.073" offset="4093964">How could you, consistent with a belief in violent overthrow under some circumstances, take the oath part two as required by Massachusetts and I suggest that --</text>

            <text syncTime="1020.064" offset="4153941">Back on the same theory, I suppose that lawyers, I disagree with an opinion of a court and yet as the officers of the Court be bound to uphold it?</text>

          <turn speaker="stephen_h_oleskey" startTime="1032.087" stopTime="1244.768">
            <label>Mr. Stephen H. Oleskey</label>
            <text syncTime="1032.087" offset="4202006">Yes, I agree that we are bound to uphold a court and a judicial system, but we are not required as this oath suggests on one interpretation to necessarily undertake arms or take any other action to physically or even verbally oppose the overthrow of the State or Federal Government which is what part two purports to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.619" offset="4288106">Of course, I have recognized that one of the difficulties here in talking about what part two does purport to require or say is that no one can really provide a satisfactory definition of that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.530" offset="4331783">Mr. Justice Stewart I think, had pointed a very basic grammatical problem which I would never have been able to resolve to my own satisfaction, which is whether or not the reference two “force, violence, illegal, unconstitutional method” modifies the words “oppose” or the word “overthrow.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.858" offset="4413076">I think it is just one example of the vagueness found in the second portion of the oath, the more fundamental problem being exactly what do those illusive words “oppose the overthrow” mean and the very fact that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in three years of arguments and again today before this Court is basically unable to offer a satisfactory example of what that language means I think suggests how very vague and illusive it is and therefore does bring it within the purview of such cases in Baggett and Bullitt and Cramp and Board of Public Instruction which were struck down similarly for vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.240" offset="4578588">I would like to respond, if I may, to the Commonwealth position that the appellees’ arguments with regard to First Amendment freedom is speculative and conjectural.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.814" offset="4632922">I think the Court, this Court has clearly faced that problem many times before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.733" offset="4656641">Mr. Justice White addressed himself forcedly to that in Baggett and Bullitt, particularly at page 373 when he talked about the dangers of conduct which might be deterred by vague oaths, the control which such an oath gives a prosecutor who might wish to deter speech, association and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.498" offset="4747652">I suggest that Mrs. Richardson or any other employee of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the 1970 census indicates that approximately 167,000 such employees who would have been exposed sometime during the period of their employment, to require them take this oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.909" offset="4817347">They have no real way to find out whether or not with these fears about First Amendment freedoms and prosecution for violation of the injunction of the oath or speculative or conjectural, except to go ahead and take the oath and take the risk, and that is exactly why this Court has quite properly struck down such oaths in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.578" offset="4899998">The other alternative is of course the one that Mrs. Richardson, in this case, chose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.986" offset="4917657">It has caused her to date a three-year wait since she was fired in November 1968, refusing to take the oath, but that is to refuse to take the oath at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.509" offset="4963737">Of course, in such cases as Wadmond and Updegraff and later cases, this Court had said that, however you style government employment, whether you consider it a benefit or privilege or what, you cannot justify either exclusion or punishment because of such an oath, where it is unduly vague or over broad.</text>

            <text syncTime="1244.768" offset="5052762">How does it work?</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.082" offset="5061957">It is perfectly clear here in the first part of the oath, the oath reads “to obey the oath,” you have purposely to speak out against “violent overthrow” that one have and secondly physically to oppose by an overthrow, suppose those things are stated there?</text>

            <text syncTime="1264.782" offset="5132801">I agree that that would clarify, but I feel that it is equally unconstitutional, clearly following the line of such cases as Barnette and West Virginia Board of Education where it was said that consistent with those school children's beliefs in another duty, in another system, they could not be compelled to take the flag salute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.085" offset="5210019">I do not think that Mrs. Richardson or any employee merely because she becomes an employee, is required to take physical action or to speak out.</text>
