            <text syncTime="422.435" offset="1763451">As I recall it, it’s a carry on through long history from the Civil Law or sort of -- I guess, for me to discourage, which was rejected in Levy to discourage the illicit relationship we would produce or also to prohibit the bringing into up to the statehood of a child, a child where the parents where actually married to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.563" offset="1899915">It’s also the law where it’s constitution on that an incestuous marriage would prohibit or prevent the acknowledgement of the child.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="490.265" offset="2034707">Mr. Lacour, do you make a separate contention here that that rule of Louisiana law respecting legitimation distinguishing between the case where there was an impediment to the marriage of the parents or there wasn’t, that that itself is a violation of equal protection?</text>
            <text syncTime="507.393" offset="2103252">Or do you concede that is rational based statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="vanue_b_lacour" startTime="511.100" stopTime="853.371">
            <label>Mr. Vanue B. Lacour</label>
            <text syncTime="511.100" offset="2118090">I concede that that is a rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.640" offset="2128225">What we are saying here, we take the position at the trust of Labine versus Vincent is not to reject or overrule Levy; that Levy, which held that on Article 2315, which is the Louisiana basic tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.746" offset="2208683">All of other law for negligence or other tort claim arise or get its source from Article 2315 of Louisiana Civil Code, which provides that roughly whoever is injured as result of the act of another is entitled to reparation.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.410" offset="2279318">And then Louisiana, through the years enacted wrong had a wrongful-death statute to give an action for tort for death to survivors.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.519" offset="2319755">And as the Court knows in Levy, the plaintiffs were illegitimate children of the mother who died as result of an alleged tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.798" offset="2360924">And the denial of a tort cause of action to those children would have to be violative of the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.951" offset="2389450">Now, what we are saying here if Levy is still the law, then Labine, it seems to me, took pain to say that Levy is still the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.547" offset="2439918">And what Labine is saying is that the denial of inheritance right is not the same kind of denial and deprivation that in a tort cause of action, the child, as Justice Douglas points out, is nurtured by the parent, is not a non-person.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.574" offset="2543990">The child is loved and he loses the same thing when he loses his parents, his mother, in that instance, the legitimate child.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.099" offset="2590070">Now, under Louisiana law it really wasn’t compensation law although all the other state, the Workmen’s Compensation law is the replacement for the tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.933" offset="2633434">Now, so 2315 could not be used against the employer here.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.549" offset="2659869">Now I need to go into just a little more explanation of the fact, because there is a tie-in between with Workmen’s Compensation and the Louisiana Tort Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.958" offset="2717548">What happened further in this case was that the grandmother of the four legitimate children sought a tort action against a third party tortfeasor who was responsible for the acts of death in which the employee was killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.163" offset="2794348">Do you still have your cause of action against your third party for tort even though you do have your worker’s compensation?</text>
            <text syncTime="686.169" offset="2818380">But whatever Workmen’s Compensation you recover from your third party tortfeasor, you owe it, the beneficiary will owe it to the employer, i.e. to insure under the right of subrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.205" offset="2890478">So the tort suit was settled, the maximum compensation payable in Louisiana in any answers at that time was $14,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.175" offset="2938439">The tort claim exceeded $14,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.870" offset="2961218">The four legitimate children then came back into the State Court and dismissed their claim for Workmen’s Compensation on the basis that there was nothing for them to recover anyway, because if they recovered, the right would belong to Aetna Casualty and the truck driving concerned the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.714" offset="3048571">Then the employer and its insurer moved to dismiss the suit on the ground that there was no -- the Workmen’s Compensation had been exhausted, and we had, of course, pleaded that the denial of Workmen’s Compensation to the two illegitimate children would constitute the denial of equal protection and the court -- the Trial Court held that they were entitled to Workmen’s Compensation but only if there was any left after the four legitimate children had used it all up.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.624" offset="3208232">So from that we appeal on that and what happens then is the Supreme Court of Louisiana interpreting the Workmen’s Compensation Law of Louisiana is saying that you have six children born of a man who are his dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.286" offset="3310841">They are supported by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.697" offset="3320454">They are all -- they are member that acted the family unit which he is maintaining at the time of his life and at the time of his death as a family unit consisting of six children.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.716" offset="3368519">The out of wedlock wife or the mother of the two illegitimate is also the stepmother of the legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.622" offset="3408225">So everything is equal insofar as the nexus or the relationship between the father and the six children.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.951" offset="5017473">The counsel in this case looked at this particular case before you is somewhere in a gray area either between Levy versus Louisiana, Labine versus Vincent and perhaps in a gray area on the either extreme of these two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.557" offset="5067941">It’s the opinion of the respondents that there is no invidious discrimination in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.252" offset="5086749">I’d like to draw a contrast in this case with Levy and Labine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.828" offset="5105035">First, in the Levy case you had a tort situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.029" offset="5121858">The Louisiana law has drawn this distinction and has not extended Levy beyond tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.197" offset="5142443">In the Labine decision, this Honorable Court noted that this is while the distinction; Levy applied the tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.819" offset="5168983">Secondly, in the Levy case it was pointed out quite forcefully the wrong doer was about to go scot-free.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.434" offset="5199389">No one was going to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.699" offset="5204509">No tortfeasor was going to have to pay for the death of the mother in the Levy case, and the case at bar at this time there is no wrong doer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.570" offset="5244007">This is Workmen’s Compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.856" offset="5249127">There is no question of fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.444" offset="5255500">There is no question of someone getting all free.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.596" offset="5268039">However, I might point out as Mr. Lacour did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.496" offset="5279638">Under Louisiana’s Workmen’s Compensation Law, the employer is entitled to recover Workmen’s Compensation benefits he pays to an employee from the tortfeasor, if there is a tortfeasor who injured the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.846" offset="5333032">We now, as respondents, have lost that right because of one year proscription in Louisiana law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1375.904" offset="5577329">The set off I got, applied to the four people on Louisiana law at the time this case was decided who could recover compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.523" offset="5603765">Mr. Lacour’s class could not, and so it is not clear at our law then, in other words, if you reverse this case and they will be, but I have now pay his clients and the set off by had against the four legitimate children is no protection to me now as to these two children and therefore the tortfeasor one year is going by and so this is an interesting quarrel, if this case is reverse the tortfeasor will get all scot-free as far as the liability for compensation to two more children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.081" offset="5701985">Now, the next point I would like to point out and distinction is the fact of this unacknowledged illegitimate children situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1420.851" offset="5757051">If you’re illegitimate you could recover no tort benefits, only legitimate children could, born in wedlock or adopted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1459.358" offset="5911174">That’s correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.557" offset="5915876">As a matter of fact I called your attention to this -- Yes, as matter of ranking in preference under Section 1232 of our Louisiana Workmen’s Compensation Law, which I quote verbatim in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.474" offset="5967598">“There are eight classifications or ranking of which dependent in which situation gets what percent of the allowable wages to be paid in Workmen’s Compensation benefits."</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.604" offset="6012111">The illegitimate unacknowledged children are treated as other dependents under the eighth ranking meaning in order of preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.179" offset="6034367">They are eighth in the line, eighth in the line of preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.324" offset="6047011">But of those eight the first, second, fourth, fifth and seventh all have situations where there may be somebody in a high ranking that does not use up the whole 65%, the balance then goes down the line and it would come to the eighth rank illegitimate unacknowledged children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.504" offset="6115660">In other words, I gave an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.149" offset="6122243">Under Section 5, Subsection 5 it says, if there are two children meaning, legitimates are acknowledged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.728" offset="6148575">These two children recovered fourty-six and one-quarter percent of the wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.627" offset="6164248">The difference between this forty-six and one-quarter percent and sixty-five percent would go down the line to the next order of persons all the way to the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.949" offset="6201447">In that case there would be a -- in this case the illegitimate children would recover the difference between forty-six and one-quarter and sixty-five percent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1548.855" offset="6269156">And so we are trying to point out here is that there is no absolute barrier for illegitimate unacknowledged child to recover compensation as the laws in the tort law of Louisiana dealing with 2315.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.615" offset="6320147">Now in the case of Labine versus Vincent the same thing is true.</text>

            <text syncTime="1571.512" offset="6359749">This again, we just pointed out, is not true in our compensation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.127" offset="6374168">Now let's take the situation of the acknowledged illegitimate child, how is it for you?</text>

            <text syncTime="1586.583" offset="6420039">At the time of the decedent’s death, no, they could not have been, that’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.570" offset="6431951">Of course the law goes on to point out that should these two persons subsequently contract illegal marriage, they then can adopt, and so the restriction there is not one for all time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.349" offset="6479076">It worked out that way in this case, because obviously, the man died before he had the chance to properly divorce his first wife and marry the woman with whom he was living.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.976" offset="6513558">And the case of the acknowledged illegitimate child, once again under Levy, he had no right of recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.908" offset="6537277">As you point out in Labine versus Vincent, he does have a right of succession, a right to be in the succession, but he has not rank equally with legitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.869" offset="6577192">Even in Labine versus Vincent, he comes in a preferential order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.489" offset="6591611">He comes down the line ahead of the State of Louisiana and several other miscellaneous persons with on the line on order of succession, but he has not acknowledged, illegitimate child is not treated equally with the legitimate child of Louisiana succession law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.370" offset="6647200">Now, we come to Louisiana’s Workmen’s Compensation Law and we see that an acknowledged illegitimate child is treated equally with the adopted or children born to a legal marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.802" offset="6700908">Therefore once again we can see that in looking to similarities, Louisiana’s Workmen’s Compensation Law does not have any were near the barriers found in Levy and it is indeed far better off than those this Honorable Court pointed out in Labine versus Vincent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.527" offset="6755765">Further, as I pointed out, in the case of whether a child can be acknowledge or not, if those two parents subsequently marry, they can then acknowledge the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.978" offset="6813652">I would like also point out the discrimination here as to the illegitimate children is no different than discrimination of a ranking of all persons in the eight subcategories of dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.389" offset="6851269">In other words the ascendants are ranked over the collateral relations and the descendants are ranked over the ascendants, and so this is just the whole schematic line up of rankings here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.485" offset="6899647">There is no invidious discrimination any of them, they use to give a preferential order of how the support is to be partialled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.824" offset="6936950">The moment -- the question was asked a moment ago as for the reason for this ranking or why this was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.871" offset="6961192">And I’d like to point out that in the -- on page 76 of the Appendix, the Louisiana Supreme Court summed it up as best as we can find anywhere in print.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.403" offset="6991285">The Louisiana Supreme Court said for ourselves we find nothing invidious into the distinction made in the compensation statute, which would protect such legally recognize family relationships anymore in the preference given the legitimate dependent children even the illegitimate ones when they’re duly acknowledged over dependent parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.729" offset="7056591">What the Court is saying here is, this is all Louisiana, legislative of Louisiana has felt that this protects the order, the existing family orders, but partialling out the compensation based upon first of all the question of dependency and secondly the question of the family relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.544" offset="7135899">I would like to point out to this Honorable Court in the Levy decision noted the fairness of Louisiana’s Workmen’s Compensation Law in footnote number 7, and so I'd like to point again, to the fact that Louisiana Workmen’s Compensation Law does not have absolute invidious discrimination or an absolute barrier to recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.023" offset="7201832">It is just in this particular case it appears that this time at this time the two illegitimate children will not recover anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.719" offset="7232552">Now if subsequently, before the 400 weeks expires, I assume that this time it has expired, if one or more of the illegitimate children had died then there would be this balance or overflow that would go down the line to the illegitimates, and so even after the Court rendered its initial opinion to this case, it was still possible for the illegitimates to come and to some Workman’s Compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.459" offset="7323563">This was noted and preserved in the judgment of the Trial Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1844.587" offset="7452085">Your Honors, I’d like to point out the language in Labine and Levy, which lead to Louisiana’s discretion or its power to do what is done in setting up this Louisiana Workmen’s Compensation Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.108" offset="7498165">In Labine, this Honorable Court pointed out and I quote, “Levy did not say and cannot barely be read to say that a state can never treat any illegitimate child differently from legitimate offspring.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.286" offset="7546857">And further the Court noted that and I quote, “The choices reflected by the interstate or the intrastate succession statutes are choices which is within its power of the State to make.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.500" offset="7587713">The Federal Constitution does not give this Court the power to overturn the State’s choice under the guidance of constitutional interpretation, because the Justice of this Court can provide better rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.351" offset="7627105">And under Levy the majority opinion and I quote, “In applying the Equal Protection Clause to social and economic legislation, we give great latitude of the legislature in making classifications.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.334" offset="7679037">I would like to say of course Louisiana’s Workmen’s Compensation Law has been definitely social and economic legislature, and we ask this Honorable Court to find that the State of Louisiana has had its latitude in making this classifications that they are not invidious and that the State can, in this case, treat illegitimate children somewhat differently in a ranking if it has not absolutely prevented them from recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.710" offset="7760539">And we ask you therefore to find that there is no invidious discrimination and to affirm the judgment of Louisiana Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1977.640" offset="7984251">Just three comment, may it please the Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.414" offset="8007344">An argument is made here that the employer and its compensation insurer would perhaps be prejudice by a non payable decision in that now proscription has run, they would not and it would be without their remedy of subrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.533" offset="8079860">But the record will show however that the circumstances in which the employer or any its insurer find itself now really was part of its own doing, the Court should -- I want the Court to know that the illegitimate children were brought into the suit by what do we call (Inaudible) in Louisiana by interpleader by the compensation carrier in order to assure itself that it would get everybody in the Court and have finally decide so it wouldn’t be left or paying multiple payments or just to avoid what normally interpleader avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.489" offset="8243700">However, at this turn of the event, when it found itself entitled to the all set and the legitimate children dismissed it too, it had its fair opportunity to uphold the dismissal and have the things finally litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.315" offset="8306916">So, any prejudice really that itself is not called by any action on the part of the appellants you know would it result to any in affirmance by the Court but really be the result of that choice made in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.904" offset="8357280">Now the allusion it made also to what the Court said in Levy that of defendants of Louisiana of course in my brief I footnote that point and when I first read it, when Levy was quite decided, it was mindful of the fact that it did not call to the attention of the Court that the fairness or the permission of the allowance of Workmen’s Compensation to illegitimate children, such as the Court saw there, was not because they were children, and I want the Court -- I want to get it clearly understood and try to get it across that the illegitimate children when they come in under classification eight to witness that more alludes, come in as other dependents and anybody else who might be a member of a family they’re not because they are the children but have been an aunt, or had been a maid, or had been an uncle living in the family and he could show that dependency of that family and there were not enough legitimate children to use up the Workmen’s Compensation he would come in so this little children are thrown with this crowd that happen to be dependent and they’re not respected as dependent member or children who have that nexus that we’re talking about that the Court was talking about in Levy and that is really the Workmen’s Compensation replace it 2315 here and if to disregard the children as it did on the workmen on the 2315 on the tort it is invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.967" offset="8709515">You’re taking away from them here the very same thing in the Ninth and the very same thing under guide of Workmen’s Compensation that would been denied on the Levy so with that --</text>

            <text syncTime="2219.455" offset="8951514">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.635" offset="8952245">Not in the both bases, but indeed particular facts on this petition case was one family unit and there is nothing nor the reason to mistreat these two children here as they were mistreated and that they were illegitimate.</text>
