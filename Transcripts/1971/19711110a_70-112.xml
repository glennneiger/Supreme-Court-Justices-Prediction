            <text syncTime="10.243" offset="114682">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.586" offset="128057">This matter is before the Court on a petition for a Writ of Certiorari United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.844" offset="161075">The pertinent facts out of which this matter arose are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.059" offset="177898">On October 1, 1969 the Assembly, one of the two Houses of the State of Wisconsin legislature passed a resolution reciting that two days earlier on September 29th, 1969, the petitioner led a gathering of the people which by its presence on the floor of the Assembly during a meeting prevented the Assembly from conducting its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.544" offset="291897">The resolution found the petitioner's conduct constituted disorderly conduct in the immediate view of the House and directly tending to interrupt its proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.691" offset="336409">The resolution then cited the petitioner for contempt and ordered that he be imprisoned in the Dane County Jail for a period of six months or for the balance of the legislative session whichever was briefer.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.008" offset="393670">Petitioner was given no notice of the charge against him and was given no hearing of any kind, either before the resolution was passed or after the resolution was passed.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="105.595" offset="496070">What I was asking, was there any effort to take him into custody at the time he was on the floor?</text>

            <text syncTime="111.194" offset="518431">None at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.938" offset="529402">At the time, the resolution was passed, the petitioner was in fact incarcerated in the Dane County Jail under a disorderly conduct charge which had been placed against him arising out of the same conduct dealt with the legislative resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.622" offset="596171">The petitioner was served with copy of the resolution and he was then confined in the Dane County Jail pursuant to the authority of the resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.481" offset="631593">After this, he was served with the copy of the resolution, he instituted various legal actions contesting the constitutionality of the procedures employed by the legislature in imprisoning him for six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.860" offset="697108">Writs of Habeas Corpus were denied by the Circuit Court of Dane County and by the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.798" offset="724902">A petition for writ of habeas corpus was filed in the United State District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.394" offset="751234">A response was filed and the District Court thereupon released the petitioner on bail, pending the determination of the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.646" offset="792298">Bail had been denied to the petitioner by both the Circuit Court of Dane County and by the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.077" offset="825944">All of the petitions for habeas corpus filed by the petitioner alleged that he had been denied Due Process law and that he had been denied the right to be represented by counsel, the right to a trial or a hearing of any kind, the right to compulsory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.662" offset="900341">The right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.271" offset="918731">The right to confront his accusers and the right to present his defense, the alleged charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.578" offset="944018">On April 8th, 1970 the District Court held that the legislative assembly could not summarily impose a jail sentence for a legislative contempt without first providing the petitioner some minimal opportunity to appear and respond to the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.848" offset="1041089">The Court granted the writ and ordered the petitioner, release under any further restrain or custody pursuant to the resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.849" offset="1073062">The respondent appealed the decision of the District Court of Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals and on appeal the judgment of the District Court was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.582" offset="1116008">Subsequently the Court of Appeals granted petitioner's request for re-hearing on bond and in a 4:3 decision affirmed the earlier decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.743" offset="1164595">The issues presented on the appeal are whether a legislative body can consistent with due process law two days after alleged contemptuous conduct, ex parte impersonate person under its contempt power without giving the person any notice of the charge against him or any opportunity, whatsoever to appear before the legislative body and respond to the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.741" offset="1272638">The second issue is whether consistent with a due process clause, a person can be found in contempt to the legislative body when the contempt resolutions sets forth mere conclusion and failed to set forth any of the underlying facts and circumstances which constituted the alleged contemptuous behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.551" offset="1359887">The petitioner respectfully contend that the Wisconsin legislature did not have the power to summarily punish for contempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="514.679" offset="2132380">The question is what is the scope for that contempt power and what procedures must they follow in exercising the contempt power.</text>

            <label>Mr. William M. Coffey</label>
            <text syncTime="532.505" offset="2203642">No, Chief Justice and as a matter of fact, the day prior to the passing of this resolution by the assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.631" offset="2240213">The petitioner had, in fact, then charged with disorderly conduct, he in fact, after the resolution was issued had a jury trial on that charge of disorderly conduct and after the jury had deliberated and was unable to return a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.490" offset="2315655">The trial Court granted the defendants motions for dismissal or judgment of acquittal which he had taken under advisement at the conclusion of all the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.838" offset="2357033">He, in fact, successfully defended the criminal disorderly conduct charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.055" offset="2381902">In regard to the summary contempt powers, Courts have clearly exercised summary contempt policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.698" offset="2412413">However, the decisions of this Court have always limited the exercise to the exercise of that power to those situations where the misconduct is actually observed by the Court and where immediate punishment was necessary to restore order and maintain the dignity and authority of the Court because of the dangers inherent in the summary contempt power which has been described as perhaps nearest akin to despotic power of any power existing under our form of Government, this Court has construed it as an exception to the normal requirements of Due process and has refused to extend it particularly in Johnson versus Mississippi, Mayberry versus Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.325" offset="2603002">The summary power has never before in the history of this country prior to October 1, 1969 ever been exercised by a legislative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.775" offset="2656814">A good reason exists for not extending that power to the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.040" offset="2681787">First, and I think foremost, Courts differ significantly from legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.808" offset="2712925">It is the duty and the business of Courts to determine and decide particular cases free from the exercise of the external influences as Judge Stevens noted in his dissenting opinion on the unbound hearing without reflecting adversely on the importance and dignity of the legislative function.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.924" offset="2809369">It must be recognized that legislators are more responsive to the temporary moods of the body politics than our judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.873" offset="2845209">And further in this case, in Johnson v. Mississippi, this Court held that a judge who was so enmeshed in matters involved was so enmeshed that matters involving a defendant that it was appropriate for another judge to seat and determine the question of this contempt and indicate noting that the trial before an unbiased judge was essential to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.693" offset="2952416">In this case given the responsiveness of the body power or legislatures through the pressures or the mood, in particular political mood at the time, I do not think you could view the Wisconsin assembly at this point as an unbiased judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1565.474" offset="6335586">Respondent sees the issue before this Court as an extremely narrow issue and that issue is whether legislative body as a State legislature, House of the State legislature or the Congress of the United States, whether, any such legislative body may exercise its contempt power in a summary fashion, that is in the same manner as the Courts exercised their contempt powers where there has been contemptuous conduct in the immediate presence of the Court tending to obstruct the Court's proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.920" offset="6489395">Question is whether the legislature in the case of a direct contempt as contrasted with a constructive contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.222" offset="6522519">Whether it may in a words of the Terry case cited in our brief proceed upon its own knowledge of the facts and punish the offender without further proof and without issue or trial in any form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.519" offset="6583750">The District Judge who first considered these issues acknowledged that the conduct described in the assembly’s resolution, if it had been committed in open Court would justify summary contempt procedure in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.301" offset="6654907">And then the District Judge said “Alright, now he have to look to see if the legislature has the same power to proceed summarily as any Court would”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.677" offset="6704331">The District Judge held that the legislature did not have such a power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.175" offset="6734320">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that it did reversing the District Judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2031.227" offset="8198535">For example, precedent for that is the cases cited in both briefs, I take it to be a non issue that there have been very grave and serious abuses of the parliamentary powers of contempt in past.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.599" offset="8264050">The amicus brief dwells at some length on this and I am certain that if there had been search made even more grievous abuses could have been cited than were cited in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.524" offset="8299786">However I do not see that as an issue in this case because what is happened in the past, this Court has said that simple abuses of the power are no reason for denying its existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.980" offset="8349627">Another thing that is conceded and is not at issue in this case, is that the contempt power and particularly the summary contempt power is an extremely delicate power to be used sparingly as this Court has said and is to be exercised with the greatest sense of responsibility, this is conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.779" offset="8436772">There is an other non issue in this case and that is the constitutionality of Wisconsin’s legislative Contempt Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.542" offset="8467805">That is the statute that was referred to by counsel, Section 1326.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.416" offset="8495286">The issue of the constitutionality of that statute was litigated in a companion case to this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.187" offset="8518378">The Freylik case and their a three Judge District Court ruled that the statute constitutional that it was not big over broad, that it did not call for involuntary servitude and other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.475" offset="8567593">There was no appeal from that decision by the Three Judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.769" offset="8596746">This case incidentally is a spin off from that case. This case started as the federal civil rights action for Declaratory Judgment and then when the Federal District Judge ruled that the portion of that action, the request for an injunction actually was a request for habeas corpus relief then this case Groppi versus Leslie became a spin off of Groppi versus Frelly and proceeded as a habeas case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.342" offset="8723074">It is also conceded and I see it to be a non issue in this case that a legislative body has other courses, it may fallow in the event of a direct disorderly contempt of its proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.898" offset="8769258">It may refer the matter to the Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2959.072" offset="11909908">I think the juror has never been mentioned in any case that I have seen but I think as matter of logic and common sense, yes deterrence plays very large part in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.742" offset="11960690">There was a case, where the United State Senate proceeded summarily and ex parte Nugent cited in the respondent's brief where the debate and the deliberations leading up to the contempt resolution and the contempt resolution itself were conducted in secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.780" offset="12044804">There again, and the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia at that time held that this was a proper procedure but the precise point that we have here, that is whether or not the legislature has any less power than the Courts around the nation to proceed in a proper case in summary fashion has never been expressly discussed and decided by any Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.215" offset="12158489">The closest decision that I know that it comes to it is Marshall versus Gordon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.517" offset="12183776">There, there is some dictum that suggests that the power -- that the Courts have to exercise summary contempt powers proceeds from the same source and that both the legislators and the Courts have identical summary contempt powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.577" offset="12271965">The District Judge said “alright there are no cases, there is nothing to guide this Court, I am going to look to see if there are any reasons in logic or in the factual circumstances of the two bodies” that is the Court and legislature to warrant a different treatment before the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.288" offset="12358796">And the District Judge said,” well, there are so many people observing disorderly conduct in the legislative chamber, that you can have a good deal of confusion as to just what took place whereas in the Court, you have only one Judge looking and it is easier if you would not have that confusion”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.853" offset="12429118">The District Judge said also, there is a second point, that there is no transcript of the proceeding in a legislative chamber whereas there is in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.164" offset="12462346">And on those two points, the District Court held that the legislature did not have summary contempt powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.686" offset="12496409">The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed and I think rightly so because if it is true that one pair of eyes is better than several pairs of eyes, then of course one juror better than many jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.603" offset="12556073">Appellate Courts, for example, would not be able to observe properly, according to the District Judge's theory, would not be able to observe a direct contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.187" offset="12602466">The differences that are pointed out in the respondent's brief between Courts and legislatures are such that the legislature should have summary contempt powers at least equal to those possessed by the Courts, because there are probably upward to 5000 Judges in this country who posses summary contempt powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.456" offset="12703508">There are only 50 legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.435" offset="12719391">When you stop a legislature, there is no other body that can pick up the ball and run with it and do the work of that that legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.928" offset="12745409">It stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.161" offset="12754290">And a continual week by week disturbance in the legislature would forever stop that legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.191" offset="12794414">Further more, a legislative body when it is proceeding to act upon a contempt, acts publicly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.467" offset="12819492">There is publicity, there is deliberation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.381" offset="12827224">Usually, in the two party political system you can expect debate before action is taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.033" offset="12857840">There are certainly similarities between legislatures and courts that again call for similar treatment, similar powers of self reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.064" offset="12897964">They have been cited. Cases have been cited going back to parliamentary times in England, Colonial times in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.679" offset="12924400">Anderson versus Dunn, up to Marshall versus Gordon, Jurney v. MacCracken, where this court has said the legislature is just as vulnerable as any Court to attack in disruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.291" offset="12978839">It has also been acknowledged by this Court many times that it is essential to preserve the independence of the legislative body and you cannot force the legislature to rely upon the -- sometimes hostile Judiciary or an unfriendly executive taking those words from United States versus Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.018" offset="13081761">There is certainly a need on the part of legislature as great as in the Courts to continue functioning and to continue the dialog that takes place in a legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.510" offset="13123662">There are no differences that warrant a denial of this power to legislature and the similarities between the two forums, to call for and demonstrate that both bodies must have equal powers to protect themselves from attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.338" offset="13198999">The contempt power is certainly very – it is a radical power, it is drastic, it is subject to great abuse and it is very properly limited and back in 1848, the Wisconsin legislature did very severely limit the contempt power of the Houses of Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.315" offset="13270888">It described a very-very narrow area in which the legislature could act upon a direct contempt. Only where there has been disorderly conduct on the floor of the House, in the immediate view of the House in which directly tends to disrupt, can the legislature act summarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.068" offset="13357928">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. William M. Coffey</label>
            <text syncTime="3327.886" offset="13385200">Mr. Chief Justice, the inquiry, the respondent has preceded that the summary contempt power is very great power subject to abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.305" offset="13438907">In the instance case, there is no way that the petitioner has ever been able to get a review, the factual basis on which the legislature asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.897" offset="13481226">The Wisconsin Supreme Court in denying the petition to writ habeas corpus suggested that some type of judicial review was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.946" offset="13521454">We filed a motion of petition for rehearing in the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and requested -- indicated that their opinion indicated such a judicial review was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.156" offset="13578297">All of the authority that we had found indicated to contrary, would the Court please advise the petitioner, what kind of hearing was available to him and grant him that hearing, but even assuming that he could have gotten the hearing at that time, I think we must recognize that hearing comes too late.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.227" offset="13662620">The petitioner was already in jail pursuant to the contempt resolution and at that point he had been denied bail and I do not believe that he should have his right to a hearing on the factual basis of the contempt after he is already in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.792" offset="13728866">I think, the hearing should precede the right of anyone to place him in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.398" offset="13751227">I suggest that as the District Court held that at a very minimum, the petitioner was entitled to be given notice of the charges against him and be given an opportunity to respond to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.912" offset="13809324">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3434.304" offset="13810891">Mr. Coffey do you suggest that judicial review of a legislative contempt determination would be available, for example on the weight of the evidence or just on procedural regularity?</text>
