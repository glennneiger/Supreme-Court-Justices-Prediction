            <label>Mr. Robert E. Kendrick</label>
            <text syncTime="15.809" offset="136946">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.013" offset="153769">It’s a privilege for me to represent the State of Tennessee here today in an effort to maintain a statute that our elected representatives enacted some 85 years ago and have maintained until this day.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.738" offset="212597">This statute is well known to Tennessee lawyers and judges and has been routinely applied and seldom questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.455" offset="243526">I believe I’m correct in saying that its constitutionality has not been challenged in the Appellate Courts to the State of Tennessee or in the United States Courts until this case and until the case of Harvey versus State which our Supreme Court decided last year sustaining the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.107" offset="318132">It is not in the record and I have not known until Mr. Summers brought forward yesterday that some man -- member committee has recommended, not a Committee of the Legislature, has recommended that the Tennessee Legislature both qualify the sequestration of witnesses rule which is now a rule of Court or by decision and also repeal or mend the statute which is before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.270" offset="438713">To my knowledge no Bill has been introduced to do that but if the -- but the legislature, the legislative branch created this statutory rule and its -- it is its prerogative to change it or to remove it or to retain it if it wishes and I don’t see that that particular relevant here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.376" offset="527216">I’d like to remind the Court of something that Justice Cardozo said a number of years ago which we believed to be at the a pro po here.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.167" offset="562324">He said to the Court in Snyder versus Commonwealth of Massachusetts, not cited in our brief but at page or Volume 291 U.S. 97 at page 105.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.271" offset="614778">The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is free to regulate procedure of its courts and a court with its own conception of policy and fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.254" offset="654693">Unless in so doing it offends some principle of justice so rooted in the tradition and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.750" offset="700669">And further at page 122, “But justice, though due to the accused, is due to the accuser also.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.640" offset="740270">The concept of fairness must not be strained till it is narrowed to a filament.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.511" offset="763676">We ought to keep the balance true.”</text>
            <text syncTime="178.038" offset="785828">Justice therefore is due to the accuser, to the victim of a crime, to the people of the State and we ask the Court today in the words of Justice Cardozo to keep the balance true.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.666" offset="844342">The balance is all ready weighted in favor of the defendant in a number of well-known ways to the Court and I shall not go into those.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.546" offset="879869">I will refer to one of them of which is pertinent here that is that if the defendant testifies, unlike all other witnesses, he may not be compelled to be outside the courtroom while other testimony is being given.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.351" offset="955101">The petitioner here would like to be favored even further.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.740" offset="972656">He would like uniquely among all the witnesses to be able after sitting in the courtroom and hearing the testimony of his own witnesses to be able to follow him to the stand and to testify in conformity to what they’ve stated.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="240.654" stopTime="245.915">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="240.654" offset="1036290">It’s not really unique because that’s what is done in 48 states of the Union, isn’t it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_e_kendrick" startTime="245.915" stopTime="306.218">
            <label>Mr. Robert E. Kendrick</label>
            <text syncTime="245.915" offset="1057292">Well it’s not unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.134" offset="1066174">It is done in 48 states but a -- unique among the witnesses, he is the only one who can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.566" offset="1091983">And he would like to be able to do that in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.093" offset="1110060">But to proceed under the sequestration of witnesses rule, none of the state’s witnesses has that privilege or is favored as this petitioner seeks to be in Tennessee, not even the prosecuting witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.015" offset="1177769">Thus a citizen may be assaulted and robbed or raped and as the prosecuting witness, he or she may not under the sequestration rule remain in the courtroom and hear the other witnesses for the state before testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.184" offset="1246419">Now, in order for the prosecuting witness to be in the test -- in the Courtroom and to assist the District Attorney General in putting all of the state’s file to the case, the prosecuting witness must go on first.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="306.218" stopTime="340.555">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="306.218" offset="1298559">Mr. Kendrick, so supposing in a Tennessee trial that the defendant does take the stand as the first of the defense witnesses then other defense witnesses are called in, one of those witnesses deals with a factual element which the defendant did not deal with in his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.767" offset="1388734">Could the counsel for the defense then recall the defendant to deal with that particular point as a part of defense case or does discretion exist in the trial judge to permit that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_e_kendrick" startTime="340.555" stopTime="390.197">
            <label>Mr. Robert E. Kendrick</label>
            <text syncTime="340.555" offset="1435859">Mr. Justice, we don’t have any decisions on that point but it’s my opinion that that could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.249" offset="1470654">While it may not, the people of Tennessee through their duly elected representatives enact and maintain a statute which requires in at least to this area that the defense be subject to the same procedure of requirements as the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.473" offset="1547559">That the accused, that he has to testify like the prosecuting witness who testifies and remains in the courtroom must testify first for his side.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.609" offset="1592071">While in the name of truth and justice and to keep the balance true, many of the people of the state not require that.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.111" offset="1670125">It does not and that’s what -- that’s part of the problem of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.397" offset="1687261">That the defendant and I referred that a moment ago that the defendant has the right, he is favored in that way and we are not contesting it to be on the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.298" offset="1722892">But under the sequestration of witnesses rule, the prosecuting witness may not be there and do the same thing and hear the other witnesses for his side and then testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.273" offset="1766778">If he is to test -- to be there, he has to testify first.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.817" offset="1784959">Now this is closely connected of course with the sequestration of witnesses rule and all we submit that all the policy arguments and statements that favor the sequestration of witnesses rule argued in favor of the Tennessee statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.524" offset="1863745">To make the sequestration of witnesses rule more effective, some states in fact this object the parties to that rule in several cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.892" offset="1905227">And a number of courts in several cases have required the parties to testify first.</text>

            <text syncTime="815.426" offset="3335379">It was a Court ruling, there was no federal statute involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.152" offset="3354292">The District Court judge simply -- well, it’s quoted on page 8 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.004" offset="3389714">The defendant wanted to -- well, the Court said that if the defendant was going to testify in his own behalf, he have to proceed all the other witnesses and the Court of Appeals said and I quote just a little bit from that says that, “Trial Court’s ruling seems to be a sensible approach to the problem of what to do with the party who is also a witness when the exclusion of witnesses is called for in order to prevent fabrication of testimony and cites Wigmore on evidence and goes on to say that there is no prejudice shown and the only connection we can think of the appellant was rendered incapable of tailoring his own testimony to fit in with what previously was said by other witnesses.”</text>
            <text syncTime="877.406" offset="3583333">And beside the American jurisdictions that we’ve referred to, a number of English speaking jurisdictions have had this rule and still have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.038" offset="3621786">And we refer in -- on pages 10 and 11 to -- a case from Alberta, Canada in which the Court said to be called as the first witness for the defense or that the accuse ought to be called as the first witness for the offense because otherwise its -- observation to the jury that the accused has called it or adopted his evidence that fit in with the evidence of the witnesses who proceeded him.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.157" offset="3730350">And we refer to an Australian case upholding the rule and I think significantly in England, a rule that’s been a matter of practice since at least 1911, only recently in 1968 by the Court of Criminal Appeals in -- or the Court of Appeals in criminal division in England in a unanimous decision was made a Rule of Court for England and the Justice who wrote the opinion for that Court in 1968 said in part, the reason for this is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.026" offset="3877786">It’s that if they are to be permitted to hear the evidence, that is the defendants or other witnesses, they may be tempted to turn their own evidence and we get and I will get to this a bit later if I have the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.310" offset="3934941">This shows the reason of a rationality of the rule and Mr. Summers saw the petitioner contends that under the Fourteenth Amendment it’s an unreasonable rule and we contend that it’s imminently a reasonable rule and this Court all said so that I referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.501" offset="4019683">So we have to take the position that the Tennessee Rule is a truth in testimonial law, a truth in testimonial law that it promotes truthful testimony that it’s a rational, a logical, a legitimate complement of the sequestration of witnesses rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.814" offset="4092930">Now, I think remarkably if the Court would look at the pages that I’m going to refer you to now in the petitioner’s brief that there is a concession of rationality there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.547" offset="4151862">So at page 9 of the petitioner’s brief, he says that the fact that a party may not be placed under the rule, that is the sequestration rule, was probably one of the chief reasons for the requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.176" offset="4206406">And then he says at page 9 that requiring the defendant to testify first if he testifies at all ensures that he will not be tempted to alter his own testimony after hearing other evidence presented in his behalf and the petitioner says further at pages 7 and 8 that the occasional readiness of the interested person to adopt his testimony when offered later to a victory rather than to a veracity so as to meet the necessities is laid opened by a file of witnesses is a rationale basis for the Tennessee statutes in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.812" offset="4368888">And then finally at page 17 of the petitioner’s brief, the petitioner says, the purpose of this code section to ensure that a defendant not be tempted to color his version of the circumstances by hearing witnesses in favor prior to his own testimony is perhaps legitimate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.990" offset="6045635">Now in the time which may remains me, I’d like to turn to the petitioners objections to the Tennessee statute and I understand from his oral argument yesterday that he does conceive that the Sixth Amendment question is not before the Court in view of the limited grant of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.939" offset="6125466">His Fifth Amendment argument as I gather is that this rule in some way infringes upon the defendant’s right to remain silent and by the way rather remarkably, I think later on he argues under the Tennessee Constitution Provision that it also infringes his right to be heard but now he says it infringes upon his right to silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.271" offset="6234762">But at page 16 of his brief he concedes, “Nor does it deny a defendant to their right to remain silent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.475" offset="6271542">His point seems to be that because he has to go on first, if he goes on at all that this is cutting down on his privilege or chilling it in some way and that it makes it more difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.251" offset="6330683">The states answer to this is, that petitioner and his counsel ought to know before they get to trial. But the testimony will be what the witnesses will say and the desirability for waiving the right to remain silent and taking the stand in its own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.759" offset="6404662">Our feeling about is that the only thing that is limited as far as the defendant is concerned is the opportunity to trim or to color or to falsify his testimony to conform of what the other witnesses on his side have said and this is what this case is uniformly say that we have all ready referred the Court to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.009" offset="6485746">The defendant says that in choosing to testify more making at charge at the beginning of his proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.597" offset="6516048">He then hazards himself through the cross examination or subjects himself to the hazards of cross examination, indeed he does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.125" offset="6550217">But every witness who goes on the stand subjects himself to that hazard and the defendant will be subjected to that hazard regardless of when he takes the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.316" offset="6594938">Another point he makes is that choosing to testify the beginning of this proof is a matter which should be left to his unfretted freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.937" offset="6637466">Now, we point out at pages 18 and 19 of our brief that the defendant has the unfretted freedom to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.499" offset="6683650">He only -- he is restricted as to when he can testify and we cite them McGautha versus California to the effect that it’s not unconstitutional simply to make him exercise a difficult choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.350" offset="6755121">I would like to move quickly to his Fourteenth Amendment argument which our view is in three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.214" offset="6786572">One is that it imposes a burden upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.533" offset="6807784">It does into some extent limit him but again, I remind the Court that he’s not restricted from testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.007" offset="6841743">He may testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.561" offset="6847908">The Court though will require him to testify first.</text>

            <text syncTime="2023.898" offset="8169286">In regards to Mr. Rehn -- Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question yesterday, I believe that in discussion at the time for rebuttal and surrebutal got jumbled up and I would like to say that it is my contention under the law that the scope that the defendant, if he was not allowed to testify and put on other witnesses, the state then put on rebuttal witnesses to testify to rebut his witnesses that he could testify as surrebutal witnesses but the scope of his surrebutal would be limited to those matters which had been brought out on the states rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.551" offset="8303869">Now, we say that that does not alleviate the problem created by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.266" offset="8338768">If he could be a surrebutal witness because there are matters which certainly we would like to -- should be submitted to the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2090.529" offset="8435839">Now, our position is that we contend that nothing can be more prejudicial than a statute which will restrict or deny a defendant from testifying his own behalf and if this statute is per se prejudicial.</text>
