          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="22.825" stopTime="349.471">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="22.825" offset="194644">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.483" offset="221288">This case is in some ways like the one just argued and in some ways different.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.501" offset="257337">It is a prosecution under Section 1462 of Title 18 of the United States Code which would have been applicable in the prior case because it makes it a crime to bring into the Unites States obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.260" offset="360364">But it is also applicable to any person who knowingly uses any express company or other common carrier for carriage and interstate or foreign commerce of any obscene, lewd, lascivious, and so on a book or other material.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.183" offset="460152">This case started with an indictment which appears on page 1 of the appendix involving a charge that a substantial amount, 68 reels of 8-millimeter color films, 216-millimeter negatives, 315-millimeter black and white films, and a number of other items were cause to be transported and carried in interstate commerce from San Francisco to Milwaukee by Trans World Airlines and North Central Airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.950" offset="659205">There was then a motion to dismiss and that motion appears on page 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.091" offset="699747">This case has been thought to involve the same question as the previous case namely whether that statute can constitutionally apply to a private transportation, but I would like to suggest to the Court that that question is not really here and that the question which is here is one which was decided by six or seven members of the court in Thirty-seven Photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.327" offset="840704">For the motion to dismiss on page 3 comes now the defendant and the above entitled action respectfully moves this Court for the entry of an order dismissing the indictment on the ground at Section 1462 of Title 18 is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.715" offset="926281">And then skipping a few lines, defendant respectfully asserts that regardless of whether the transportation is for the purpose of commercial distribution or for the personal possession and enjoyment of the transporter, this statute violates rights guaranteed by the First and the Ninth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.602" offset="1013739">And then at the bottom of page 6, six lines from the bottom have having dealt previously with the private transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.540" offset="1057520">On the other hand, should the statute be construed to impose criminal sanctions only upon those who utilize interstate commerce for the purpose of the commercial distribution of obscene material, then the statute denies to the defendant the right to sell and distribute obscene material which is predicated upon the correlative right of an intended recipient to purchase and enjoy this material.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.744" offset="1174340">Thus, it seems to me quite clear that this case involves exactly the same questions as those in Thirty-seven Photographs two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.945" offset="1235153">First, is the statute unconstitutional because it might apply to private importation and the court in Thirty-seven Photographs held that the statute should not be so construed and that even though it might be invalid as applied to private importation in that case, that it would be valid as applied to commercial importation.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.005" offset="1399411">The result of the decision below is to deprive the United States of its opportunity to prove that this was a commercial transportation and not a private transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.817" offset="1450611">If it was a commercial transportation, United States against Thirty-seven Photographs is clear authority for the constitutional validity of the statute.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="349.471" offset="1501288">Well are you suggesting Mr. Solicitor General that we could not hold the private use in the preceding case protected without making the situation you just described?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="371.028" stopTime="387.331">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="371.028" offset="1587493">No, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.010" offset="1595434">The question which we argued in the last case is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.557" offset="1617586">I have little more that I can say about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.992" offset="1627303">All I am saying is that that question isn’t here.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.493" offset="1641305">That question is not presented by this record.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="387.331" stopTime="389.934">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="387.331" offset="1652694">This District Judge struck down the statute on its face, is it not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="389.934" stopTime="568.101">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="389.934" offset="1663143">This judge cut down the statute on its face held that it was unconstitutional entirely, and I think that is demonstrably wrong because I think the court has decided that it is constitutional as applied to a commercial transportation in Thirty-seven Photographs, and I think that the court had decided that even though it might be unconstitutional as applied to a private transportation, that is not a sufficient basis for holding the entire statute unconstitutional on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.023" offset="1807444">And in this connection, I would point out two other decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.434" offset="1833148">The very District Judge below who decided this case has subsequently decided in effect that his decision was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.588" offset="1873690">Since this Court decided Thirty-seven Photographs, he has sustained a prosecution under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.592" offset="1905768">In United States against Zacher, 332 F. Supp. 883, now there was confusion at the earlier argument where my associate Mr. Greenawalt said 833 and the case could not be found, but it exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.485" offset="1985285">It is 332 F. Supp. 883.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.846" offset="2006706">And also at the same time that the case was coming through the Wisconsin Court, there was another case in which the same defendant, George Joseph Orito was convicted under the same statute in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, that conviction was affirmed it being a commercial dissemination and this Court denied certiorari in 402 U.S. 987 almost contemporaneously with the decisions in Reidel and Thirty-seven Photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.178" offset="2192071">And so, this is my argument in this case that the question involved in the previous case 200 reels of film is not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.307" offset="2268557">It is not properly before the court and that the only questions to which are in this case have already been squarely decided by a clear majority of the court in Thirty-seven Photographs.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="568.101" stopTime="568.803">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="568.101" offset="2375764">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="568.803" stopTime="888.684">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="568.803" offset="2378585">Mr. Chief Justice as I have already indicated, I do not think that the question of private use of pornographic or obscene materials is involve in this case, and I would rather hesitate to hazard that, shall we say ultimate issue on this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.522" offset="2489448">I would like to observe however that even at best, this is not a very private situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.820" offset="2534693">The indictment here charges the shipping of a substantial quantity of material by Air Express.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.554" offset="2577638">Not personal luggage, not accompanying the traveler, but the transportation over a distance of some 2,000 miles within the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.536" offset="2653497">If that is personal, then the underlying foundation of Stanley which I take it to be thought control and I just like thought control but it can be a kind of a shibboleth which serves to stifle further the thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.526" offset="2765511">If that is private, then Stanley it seems to me has little or no limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.789" offset="2806575">And in that connection, I would like to refer to another case which was once before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.644" offset="2841997">This is B &amp; H Distributing Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.317" offset="2860596">United States against B &amp; H Distributing Corporation which was where an indictment was dismissed by the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, Judge Doyle and that case Judge Gordon here, the United States took an appeal and this Court on June 21, 1971 in 403 U.S. 927 vacated the judgment and the remanded it for consideration for reconsideration in the light of this Court’s decision in United States against Reidel and United States against Thirty-seven Photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.661" offset="3054007">Now in Judge Doyle’s first opinion in that case, he drew the distinction between private and public.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.256" offset="3096430">He did not make it between private and commercial, but he drew it between private and public and he said if the terms are employed, then public uses or conduct must be defined as those which are in conflict with the goal or interest of protecting children from exposure to obscenity or with the goal or interest of preventing assaults on the sensibilities of an unwilling adult public, private uses or conduct must be defined as those which are not so in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.549" offset="3253582">Now, that you see extends the private conception to everything except children and nonconsenting adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.042" offset="3291512">That seems to me to have no proper foundation and the concern about thought control which underlies Stanley.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.298" offset="3348564">I would point out that the decision that commercial distribution may be made criminal has a thought control element because if the material is more difficult to obtain through commercial distribution, it becomes harder for these ideas such as they are to be communicated and thought about by individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.780" offset="3458487">Now, this B &amp; H case went back to the Western District of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.246" offset="3484400">The court has again dismissed the indictment relying on Stanley against Georgia, and I have authorized the taking of a further appeal to this Court not only because of the issue, but because I feel a considerable obligation to lay before this Court any decision in which a court holds an act of Congress to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.615" offset="3593801">It seems to me that if an act of Congress is unconstitutional, it ought to be by decision of this Court with full respect of course to the lower courts which must develop the cases for our presentation here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1227.803" offset="5014549">I don’t think that the distinction between private and commercial can find any support on the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.719" offset="5050284">I can see some reasons when one thing is in term to thought control, but I do not find anything in the First Amendment that says anything about thought control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.048" offset="5091558">If one thinks in terms of thought control, then I think he can focus in on the man’s library in his own home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.046" offset="5123532">It was extraordinarily unfortunate that those Georgia officials who had power to under a search warrant to seize gambling equipment took it upon themselves to take materials out of the man’s private library and thereby create a case which came to this Court and I have great sympathy with the conclusion which was reached that is was not appropriate for them to prosecute him for the mere possession of materials in his own library, though I would have put it on Fourth Amendment grounds rather than on First Amendment grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1326.323" offset="5408684">Yes, I suppose you could and that it seems to me might conceivably involve a question under the Fourth Amendment which allows only reasonable searches and seizures, and a search for printed material, a man’s diary for example in the privacy of his own home might well be established by decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.992" offset="5515368">Boyd case comes -- approaches it doesn’t quite get there long ago as being beyond the scope of a reasonable search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.304" offset="5584541">Thus, if this case does involve any question of the applicability of the First Amendment to private possession of obscene material, we would make the same argument here that we made in the previous case that there is no appropriate basis for construing the First or shall I say expanding the First Amendment to make it applicable here, and that the decision below should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1414.341" offset="5760711">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.420" offset="5781086">Let me at the outset correct if I may, a few impressions that may have been left with this Court by the Solicitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.099" offset="5823718">The opinion of Judge Doyle in B &amp; H Distributing Company rendered on September 14, 1972 after remand by this Court held only one thing and that is it held at Section 1462 is overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.789" offset="5906578">It did not have anything whatsoever to do with children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.568" offset="5921625">It had nothing whatsoever to do with nonconsenting adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.442" offset="5937089">It had nothing whatsoever to do with pandering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.744" offset="5950360">It merely held that Section 1462 as enacted can be applied to constitutionally protected activity, and for this reason is overbroad and it is therefore void.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.563" offset="6009605">Secondly, incidentally Judge Doyle in that opinion assumed for the purposes of that opinion that the defendants in that case where engaged in the commercial distribution of obscenity, and he assumed that on the basis of the fact among other things that a large number of magazines where involved that it was not -- it was transportation by an express company and further that one of the defendants was the B &amp; H Book Distributing Company and he figured that it was a reasonable assumption that it was a commercial venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.771" offset="6142412">Second of all, the Zacher case which has been alluded to by the Solicitor is the companion case to Orito.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.323" offset="6172714">Zacher and Orito while charged in different indictments where charged with the same transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.645" offset="6201971">And so, the record in Zacher flashes out the facts that are of course absent here for we are here on an indictment and its dismissal only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.785" offset="6238542">And in that, in the hearings in Zacher, it is quite clear that Mr. Justice Stewart’s inference is quite correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.293" offset="6276577">And that is that the luggage was with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.149" offset="6291937">This was personal hand luggage carried by it on an airplane in the cargo compartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.983" offset="6315342">So, with those two matters out of the way, I can address what I conceived to be as the logic of our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.881" offset="6350869">We approach the Court and ask the Court to look at Stanley and if Stanley means anything, it means that in our society today, a person can read what he wants, can look at what he wants, can enjoy the kind of material he wants to enjoy regardless of whether it has social value or not, that the private consumption of ideas is beyond the criminal sanctions of the Federal Government and beyond the criminal sanctions of any state including Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.254" offset="6488377">The question then arises, does it really make any difference whether I am reading the obscene magazine in my home or whether I am reading it on an airplane, or whether I am taking it from my home to my summer home on an airplane or in a train and we asserted clearly does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.059" offset="6571656">That the statute by its terms explicitly applies to the kind of reading to which I have referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.088" offset="6611675">It referred to persons who carry obscene material by common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.602" offset="6633827">There is no exception, there is no exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.299" offset="6648560">The statute as it is written is overbroad and I think the question is what do we now?</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.319" offset="6676668">I think in its last argument and the last time we are here and again today, the Solicitor suggests that what you do is you give the statute a limiting construction, and you limit this construction to apply only to transportation in aid of or in furtherance of some commercial venture or distributive process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.622" offset="6789831">Without arguing, what the merits of such a statute would be and I have serious questions whether such a statute would be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.727" offset="6822327">It certainly would be a better statute than the one we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.709" offset="6838209">And the question then is, can this Court do it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.982" offset="6851271">Can such a limiting construction be placed on Section 1462 so that the statute instead of reading transports in interstate commerce by common carrier would read transports with intent to sell or distribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.528" offset="6929533">That’s what would have to be done to the statute and I submit you can’t do it and you can’t do it for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.770" offset="6962448">The first reason you can’t do it is that Congress did it and did it at 1894 and the legislative history of this statute shows that in 1894, in 1896, in 1897 and all the way up to 1909, this statute included the words with intent to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.241" offset="7052309">In 1909, there was a general revision of the Penal Code, and in the general revision of the Penal Code, the issue came up, whether or not we should include in the statute the phrase that had been there for 15 years, that is should we include in the statute “for intent to sell or distribute?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.847" offset="7142797">And the congressional history and the comments of those who addressed themselves to this Bill in the revision in 1909 and 1910 shall quite clearly that it was the intent of those who change the statute to make the statute now encompass personal possession, non-commercial possession, non-distributive possession, and why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.017" offset="7255437">Assembling Congressman Shurley said, we want to do it so that it is consistent with Section 1461.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.237" offset="7292322">It wasn’t 1461 then, it was a different number.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.920" offset="7303084">I think perhaps 212.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.494" offset="7313324">He said we want to do it so it is consistent with the Comstock Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.981" offset="7327326">The Comstock Act does not have any exemption, doesn’t exclude personal distribution by the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.951" offset="7355225">Therefore, we don’t want this one to do it, sort of an abstract symmetry; that’s one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.876" offset="7378840">Secondly, it was pointed out that if this only covered persons who transport with intent to sell, it would be impossible to enforce that nobody could ever prove up a case under the statute that we have to have a statute that covers both personal and commercial transportation, or will never get any convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.846" offset="7458774">The statute was changed in 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.702" offset="7470164">The intent to sell was dropped out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.746" offset="7482389">We have essentially today with some changes, albeit but not in pertinent part the statute that was adopted in 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.016" offset="7519483">And perhaps the argument could be made well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.719" offset="7534216">Congress did not know of the kind of reasoning that would come up in Stanley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.087" offset="7555741">The statute was tapered with again last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.430" offset="7569115">Certainly, Congress knew Stanley, it has been decided by last year and last year when Congress withdrew from the reach of the statute, persons who shipped material advising others to use contraceptive devices certainly could have tinkered with the statute in this area as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.584" offset="7633690">It is not as though the statute’s never been fussed with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.718" offset="7646229">The statute was changed in 1920 to include motion pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.395" offset="7660962">It was a changed, I guess I say again last year, to exclude contraceptive devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.002" offset="7683427">So, the legislative history is squarely against any rewriting of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.040" offset="7719581">In order to rewrite the statute, you would have to rewrite it back the way it was in 1894 and 1897, and essentially, you have to be telling Congressman Vilas, Congressman Shurley, and Congressman Houston that you didn’t mean what you said, and really the statute as you originally enacted, it should be permitted to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.956" offset="7803173">And I submit that’s legislation, that’s not adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.187" offset="7820100">Secondly, the second reason that you can’t draft the statute is because one limiting construction won’t save it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.720" offset="7858239">Shall we have a statute that we are going to draft which will prohibit us was suggested in our last argument some months ago, my delivering by interstate carrier, my library of obscenity to the Library of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.860" offset="7914768">Shall we have a statute that excludes gifts?</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.503" offset="7933367">Shall we have a statute at which we will write in a presumption such as is written in the 1465 so that those in the Attorney General’s Office and the Department of Justice have a chance of winning a prosecution under it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.891" offset="7986970">1465 needs a presumption because without the presumption, nobody would ever get a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.290" offset="8012570">Must you also then write a presumption into 1462?</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.706" offset="8030229">Yet, still another problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.248" offset="8040364">What shall you do if you are going to rewrite the statute for Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.290" offset="8056560">If you are going to rewrite the statute for us all about those jurisdictions in which it is now lawful for adults to buy/sell, possess and transport admittedly obscene material?</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.682" offset="8106088">I know that Oregon is such a state now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.633" offset="8117896">I am advised that Hawaii has recently enacted similar legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.711" offset="8138167">Shall you draft into the statute as has been drafted into number of other federal statutes, exemptions to exempt those who ship this material and the jurisdictions in which it is not contraband?</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.487" offset="8193337">I submit this is not such a statute that you can rewrite it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.853" offset="8214758">You are not dealing with the procedural problems of Luros.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.714" offset="8230222">You are dealing with the whole fabric of the statute as you were in Blount versus Rizzi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.514" offset="8253419">The statute must go back to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.937" offset="8263137">It cannot -- it cannot I submit be given a limiting construction by this Court consonant with any of the principles which you have previously expressed concerning limiting statutes and interpreting congressional enactments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.726" offset="8342235">The -- this is not a question where you can sever out an offending word from a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.072" offset="8375672">There are no offending words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.366" offset="8384867">What you must do is you must take the language of the statute itself and add clauses to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.451" offset="8421125">Now in Luros, you have a severability statute that permitted you to sever out certain applications, and perhaps you could do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.264" offset="8464384">You do not have the same severability statute in Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.545" offset="8485595">Now, regardless of how you see the roots of Stanley, I think it’s possible perhaps to see Stanley having its roots as a First Amendment problem, as a First Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.516" offset="8553409">The right perhaps to read, the right to acquire ideas, perhaps it’s a Fourth Amendment right and kind of a strange sense that the home gives the whole problems of Stanley and added dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.293" offset="8608580">Perhaps also it’s a Ninth Amendment right, just the right to be let alone, the right to read and enjoy what you like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.384" offset="8636897">And if Stanley has Fourth Amendment, Fourth Amendment dimensions, so Orito also has added dimensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.311" offset="8676603">Although Orito is on an airplane with his luggage, and Mancusi and Katz tell us that where one has a reasonable expectation of privacy, the Fourth Amendment gives him such privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.307" offset="8740551">Other cases speak to the same issue, if you look at Edwards versus California, long time ago back in 1941, and more recently Dunn versus Blumstein, and still more recently I think Shapiro versus Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.822" offset="8810663">We have another right. Somehow Mr. Orito has a right to travel within the continental United States and no one can place a burden on that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.213" offset="8852250">I don’t know that this Court has ever set forth clearly what the roots of the right -- of that right are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.727" offset="8878268">But somewhere, somewhere in the fabric of our constitution is Mr. Orito’s right to go from Washington to Milwaukee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.281" offset="8916511">And if he can go from Washington to Milwaukee, if he can go one place to another, then he can go carrying something as long it is not contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.333" offset="8956740">As long as it’s not goods made with convict made labor, as long as it’s not goods made with children, as long as it’s not contaminated fruit, what Mr. Orito can read in the privacy of his home in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he can carry with him to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.509" offset="9017448">For he has the right to read and the right to travel, and the two of them come together in much the same way as Stanley has right to read and his right to be let alone in his own home, sort of come together --</text>
