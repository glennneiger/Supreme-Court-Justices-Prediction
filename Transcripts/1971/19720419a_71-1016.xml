            <text syncTime="47.586" offset="264021">This case presents two basic issues, the first is the issue of whether the Federal Power Commission has jurisdiction to protect the interstate consumers of natural gas transported in interstate commerce, regardless of whether the ultimate customer of that gas is a customer, the distribution company or a direct purchaser from the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.145" offset="346254">The second issue is whether or not --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gordon_gooch" startTime="71.148" stopTime="281.325">
            <label>Mr. Gordon Gooch</label>
            <text syncTime="71.148" offset="358271">Yes, sir, whether the Federal Power Commission has jurisdiction under Section 1 (b) of the Natural Gas Act, and sections 4, 5 and 16 to regulate the curtailments of service of gas transported in interstate commerce by interstate pipelines, regardless of whether the customer is a customer of a distribution company, or a direct purchaser from the pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.822" offset="457014">The second issue is whether the Fifth Circuit properly found that the Federal Power Commission did not have jurisdiction over certain facilities when the Federal Power Commission subsequently has found that they did have jurisdiction over those facilities due to the injection of substantial quantities of interstate gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.462" offset="543531">The case arose when Louisiana Power and Light filed suit in the District Court in Louisiana seeking to enjoin United Gas Pipe Line, from implementing any curtailment program which would result in the reduction of gas delivered to two of their generating plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.178" offset="618450">At the time, the suit was instituted, two separate proceedings were pending before the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.941" offset="645409">The first proceeding, a curtailment proceeding was to determine the Federal Power Commission's jurisdiction to allocate the suppliers of Interstate Natural Gas pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.668" offset="688354">When their gas supplies were so depleted that they were unable to meet the contracts of all of their consumers in all states served by the pipeline, directly or indirectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.049" offset="725866">And a second proceeding was pending to determine the jurisdictional status of certain facilities that are part of the United Gas Pipe Line system, that and part of the time in the past had been operated in intrastate commerce with a separate system of supply, but subsequently quantities of interstate gas had been injected into the former intrastate system.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.489" offset="815623">And the question presented was whether or not those facilities, therefore were subject to federal and not state jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.081" offset="842058">The Louisiana Power and Light company obtained a temporary restraining order ordering United to make their full deliveries without curtailment.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.542" offset="879884">On LP&amp;L's claim that domestic customers did not need the gas, that was ordered curtailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.286" offset="918858">In time sequence now, and I'll skip some procedural matters, in time sequence, the Federal Power Commission then held in the curtailment proceeding that under section 1 (b) of the Natural Gas Act, Sections 4 and 5 the decisions of this Court in the Transco case and Panhandle in 332 U.S, that the Federal Power Commission had plenary jurisdiction under its transportation authority, over gas dedicated to interstate commerce and being transported in interstate commerce, and had the power to curtail, any and all customers of a pipeline in order to be sure that a fair allocation of gas supplies would be available to all interstate consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.942" offset="1085415">Next, in time sequence, the Fifth Circuit held that the Federal Power Commission had no jurisdiction to order curtailments of deliveries of gas dedicated to interstate commerce, transported in interstate commerce but delivered to direct industrial consumers as distinguished from deliveries to distribution companies for ultimate resale to public, citizens, and industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.109" offset="1190114">Subsequently --</text>

            <label>Mr. Gordon Gooch</label>
            <text syncTime="350.071" offset="1474013">I can't say that, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.013" offset="1477774">I think that they would permit an abandonment proceeding, that would have a result of reducing permanently the services to a direct industrial customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.111" offset="1518107">I don't think there is any question of Fifth Circuit that curtailments could be handled, that is to say abandonments of service could be handled under Section 7, that wasn't an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.183" offset="1554470">The issue was whether or not it could be handled under Sections 4, 5, and 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.039" offset="1573801">The Fifth Circuit went on to hold that the Federal Power Commission could not exercise jurisdiction over the former intrastate facilities because in the Fifth Circuit's view the quantities of gas injected in to that system were de minimis, and there was a possibility that another affiliate of the pipeline could have put the same quantities of gas into the system that were interstate gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.242" offset="1662617">In the Federal Power Commission's opinion subsequently issued, the Commission found that the gas being injected into the system was substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.268" offset="1694800">In fact made 67% of the peak day deliveries for the New Orleans' system, and found that the affiliate of the United Gas Pipe Line did not have sufficient quantities or deliverability basis to make up the difference and that the interstate gas was needed in order to maintain the peak day viability of the formally intrastate system.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.532" offset="1791871">Now both Commission decisions, both deciding its authority under curtailments, and also deciding its authority over the Green System as it's called are now pending before the Fifth Circuit for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.681" offset="1848400">The Commission through the Solicitor General requested certiorari because if the Fifth Circuit's decision is correct, and the Federal Power Commission has no jurisdiction over gas transported in interstate commerce, except as an initial certifying matter or except at the conclusion of an abandonment proceedings after the individual customer is being compelled to abandon.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.569" offset="1959995">Then the Federal Power Commission is powerless to prevent the interstate consumers of Natural Gas, the domestic consumers, the homes, the schools, or hospitals from being certain that they have a chance for their fair share of a scarce gas supply when the pipelines are unable to meet all other contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.565" offset="2047975">Now LP&amp;L has put a question that the Louisiana Commission is better able to determine the public interest of Louisiana citizens for the use of gas supply than the Federal Power Commission, and they argued that the elected officials of the state of Louisiana would be more likely to protect the interest of Louisiana citizens than with the Federal Power Commission, we don't argue that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.288" offset="2154868">Our point is that it is our responsibility as we read the Natural Gas Act and the decisions of this Court under it. It is our responsibility to protect the gas supply of all consumers in all states served by the interstate pipeline, and in this case, gas from United gets us far away as Boston, because they resale the Texas gas, Texas Eastern, Transco, Southern Natural, and that gas then is transported not only in interstate commerce by United but by other pipelines throughout the Eastern portion of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.664" offset="2276390">And if the Federal Power Commission has no authority to curtail or divert the volumes that are dedicated to industrial consumers in the state of production or in any other state, then the Commission has no authority either to prohibit undue preferences or discriminations under Section 4, which is a clear ground of authority to the Commission, nor any action under Section 5 or 16 of the Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.859" offset="2393105">Now section 1 (b) of the Natural Gas Act from which our authority derives states clearly that we have three alternate, basis independent responsibility jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.903" offset="2441275">The first is jurisdiction over transportation of gas in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.886" offset="2461232">The second is over sales for resale of gas in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.470" offset="2479623">And the third is over the Natural Gas companies themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.122" offset="2494147">And this court in the East Ohio case in 338 US and in the Panhandle case 332 US has clearly set out those as independent grounds of the Federal Power Commission's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.990" offset="2541689">And in two cases, the Panhandle 332 and in Transco 365, this Court has specifically recognized that when curtailments are necessary, that curtailments and interruption of service are matter that relates to transportation and therefore within the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission to control, and allocating the competing demands among the several states.</text>

            <text syncTime="852.557" offset="3483874">Secondly, in this very case on LP&amp;L's sworn allegation, the District Court entered a temporary restraining order, saying that the domestic customers did not need the gas and therefore LP&amp;L could not be interrupted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1074.785" offset="4372873">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.496" offset="4391681">While the question before the court is a limited one of the curtailment jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission, the commission has graciously conceded five minutes of this presentation to United, its co-petitioner here to speak to a few of the practical aspects of this problem that we hope the Court will keep in its mind as it decides the question of FPC curtailment jurisdiction or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.964" offset="4525533">United is an interstate gas transmission system covering the states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, and supplying some five other jurisdictional pipelines which in turn supply much of the gas, that's eventually consumed in the mid-west and in the east.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.399" offset="4619260">In addition to people such as Louisiana Power and Light and in addition to those other jurisdictional pipeline customers, we serve over 200 other direct industrial customers including some 14 different power plants such as Louisiana Power and Light.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.545" offset="4691881">We serve over 100 distribution companies that in turn supply gas to some 800 different communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.261" offset="4726780">And of extreme significance is the fact that some 37% of our volume is taken up in these direct industrial sales and this makes the decision of the Court of Appeals, excluding direct industrial sales from the curtailment jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission, extremely important not only to United but to United's other customers as well, or it's undisputed that the total gas requirements of all of United's customers just cannot be met irrespective of what this court decides about whether the FPC has curtailment jurisdiction or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.236" offset="4910682">The electrical utilities and the other direct industrial customers all assert different theories about why they should have priority to get their full requirements, and they do so without regard to the impact or effect that these positions they are taking may have on the distribution companies and the domestic consumers along the length and the breadth or our system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.517" offset="5023740">Well, if these conflicting interests are to be resolved in terms of a system wide shortage without effective regulation, the priorities will have to be based on such factors as who has the physical capacity by virtue of his geographical location close to the source of supply of United's gas, or who is able to get to the courthouse first and then join United's reduction of deliveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.501" offset="5143694">Gas beyond curtailed levels that's obtained by such means is simply going to be taken away from others of United's customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.418" offset="5183401">So we get right down to the question of who is going to determine the priorities to an interstate pipelines limited supplies of gas among a variety of customers in many, many states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.127" offset="5242228">Well, reducing deliveries to industrial customers as maybe necessary to meet human needs or requirements, is basically a matter of interrupting service, not abandoning contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.217" offset="5302519">And it calls for interruption of services all along the interstate pipeline system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.201" offset="5326447">And this Court had announced on two occasions that interrupting service was a matter largely related to the transportation jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.340" offset="5367094">Thus within its jurisdiction, that was the procedure United followed to implement and seek FPC approval of a curtailment program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.693" offset="5412442">A curtailment which had its impact on industrial sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.990" offset="5433654">It has thus far had no impact and foreseeably and hopefully will have no impact on domestic consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.487" offset="5467613">The same is true with respect to the gas that's supplied to the power plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.477" offset="5487570">Their deliveries are reduced to the extent that they use gas for the generation of electricity for industrial consumption, but their human needs requirements are supplied without any reduction whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.051" offset="5557892">Under FPC jurisdiction, we believe that this program of orderly reduction of deliveries can be handled in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.242" offset="5598643">It can be handled uniformly, whether exceptional circumstances that apply to one customer, they can be viewed in light of the interests of all the customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.865" offset="5645141">State regulatory agencies for practical and legal purposes are not equipped to handle such problems of an interstate pipeline system and to allow it to be conducted by random litigation and conflicting Court decisions based upon different facts relating to different special interests in different states has put us in a complete state of chaos in the gas industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.860" offset="5761125">This is not to suggest that need creates federal power and the curtailment jurisdiction in the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.396" offset="5807309">It is to suggest that since Congress specifically wanted to avoid any regulatory gap and since the job cannot be done at the local and the state level, that the logical place for it to be done is within the parameters of the Natural Gas Act by the Federal Power Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="1497.092" offset="6062055">Now the FPC in order to scrape that holding is arguing that it has a plenary jurisdiction under what it terms its transportation authority, and it points to the first part of Section 1 (b) to say that that's where its transportation authority resides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.848" offset="6157036">Now, our brief we believe adequately talked about the direct sale aspects and we believe the Fifth Circuit opinion adequately speaks to that subject and we're going to spend our time today in rebutting that the position that the FPC takes about this plenary transportation authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.341" offset="6259018">I think that while there is a lot of chaff in this case, we can get to the essence very quickly by my saying that in order to determine the jurisdiction here, all we have to look at is three key factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.867" offset="6337177">And I'm not going to say as Mr. Plotkin said earlier that this is a simple issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.252" offset="6358702">But I believe that if we look at the three factors it will simplify the case for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.124" offset="6382212">Those three factors are, first of all, the congressional history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.039" offset="6397885">And in this case I don't believe I can emphasize too strongly, the effect of that congressional history on this whole matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.780" offset="6436860">The second thing is the decisions of this Court, and I'm speaking now of the Panhandle Indiana case, 337 and the Transco case in 365 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.258" offset="6494747">And the third is the actions of the FPC itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.232" offset="6510630">Now, addressing myself to the congressional history first and I'll dwell on it a little bit because as I said it is so important to this whole matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.809" offset="6552948">We did a rather comprehensive study of that legislative history and it became more interesting all along, because we found that the history here was taking place during 1936, 1937 and 1938, which I believe we all will agree were the high watermarks of the Roosevelt administration in terms of the passage of regulatory legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.773" offset="6680739">And an example of that I would say is the National Labor Relations Act, which is I think the Court knows so well has an exclusive or peremptory nature to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.389" offset="6743224">And I think all of that legislation at that time was of the same type with the sole exception of this Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.286" offset="6778855">That's an interesting thing about this congressional history is that Congress and apparently it was getting a lot of heat, I would say, from the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commission as the representatives of the state authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.172" offset="6854401">And speaking for the states, they made a strong case for the proposition of dual regulation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.038" offset="6889823">And as a result, you had -- running like a thread through the congressional history, the proposition that we would have dual regulation and we were going to leave to the states, those things that the states had already been regulating and that Congress felt they could reach and the courts felt they could reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.255" offset="6982715">Now Section 1 (b) reflects that history because Section 1 (b) really is a two part sort of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.873" offset="7025138">In the first part of the statute, it tells what matters will fall into the ambit of FPC jurisdiction, and then it has a 'But' Clause in it, a conservatory proviso which reserves to the states those things that are to be for state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.562" offset="7119910">And it is in that conservatory proviso that we find the saving grace to opposition here because it was there that Congress reflected in the statute that congressional history that I just described.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.928" offset="7185425">The second aspect that I find in the congressional history that so pertinent here is that Congress indicated plainly and unqualifiedly that it knew of the Court decisions and the reach of the states under those Court decisions, and specifically mentioned the Pennsylvania Gas Company case during the congressional debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.093" offset="7302036">I think that without dwelling on any long quotes from the congressional history, I do have a sample that's only one shot couple of sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.916" offset="7353340">That sums the whole matter up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.814" offset="7364938">In House Report for 709, of the 75th Congress which is, I would say is the foundation report, in all of this congressional history and the court will find that this court has many times discussed that House Report and cited it in its decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.860" offset="7453128">In that House Report 709, it is said that states have of course for many years regulated sales of Natural gas to consumers in intrastate transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.947" offset="7501507">The states have also been able to regulate sales to consumers even though such sales are in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.664" offset="7536302">Such sales being considered local in character and in the absence of congressional prohibition subject to state regulation, and they cite the Pennsylvania Gas Company case and then they say there is no intention in enacting the present legislation to disturb the states in the exercise of such jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.976" offset="7621565">Now, Your Honors, it seems to me plain from that congressional history, that the FPC's claim to a plenary transportation jurisdiction, just is completely contradicted by that history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.857" offset="7713098">Because the Congress knew that these direct industrial sales were being made through interstate facilities, which is what the FPC says gives them this plenary authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.248" offset="7770672">And yet they exempted in Section 1 (b), all of those sales even though they were through interstate facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.726" offset="7812573">So, I think the first key furnishes us a rather adequate pick for the FPC coffin.</text>

            <text syncTime="1968.638" offset="7948201">Now, we say that that language when compared with the language of the remainder of that section means to reflect the congressional history, that I just talked about of exempting all direct industrial sales even those made through interstate facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.634" offset="8044227">That's what that language has been held, I mean this isn't my interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.167" offset="8078395">Now, let's go to the second factor I said was a key here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.229" offset="8098561">Let's talk about for a moment the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.307" offset="8110891">I am speaking now again of Panhandle Indiana and Transco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.516" offset="8135760">The Panhandle Indiana case involved an effort by a pipeline to make a direct sale in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.473" offset="8167629">The Indiana commission sought to regulate both the rate of that sale and the service terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.521" offset="8195737">By the way, you will find in the briefs, although it didn't come out in this oral argument today that (Inaudible) company and I think the Fifth Circuit does too with the FPC when they tried to talk about separating out rate by equating it with sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.130" offset="8258222">I think it's perfectly understandable from the whole, you might say the conjures of jurisprudence on this whole subject that a sale includes not only rate but other terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.280" offset="8310780">And their knowledgeable former Chairman Mr. Swidler certainly admitted that during his efforts in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.058" offset="8341918">But back to the Panhandle case, in that case, the state commission was trying to regulate both the rate and the service terms, which is what is put in this case because we are arguing here about curtailment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.678" offset="8412449">The pipeline went in to court and sought an injunction on the ground that the FPC had jurisdiction and this Court held that the FPC had no jurisdiction over a direct industrial sale of the type LP&amp;L has here, and it said that the state could regulate the rate and the terms, the rate and the terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.237" offset="8502623">Now, may it please the court, it is from that decision, way at the end of the decision about the last paragraph or two that we find a random sentence by Mr. Justice Rutledge, at lo and behold has furnished what I called in my brief the (Inaudible) of dictum that the FPC is hanging on desperately here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.581" offset="8600008">That's a sentence where Mr. Justice Rutledge talked about interruptions of services and suggested that the FPC might be able to handle those in accommodation with the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.064" offset="8658000">Now, to take that random sentence at the end of that decision after the majority, after the holding had been made that there was this exemption of direct industrial sale in both its rates and its terms, means, certainly that it had to be dictum because otherwise it would contradict the main holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.069" offset="8753921">But it also rather much picked our curiosity and we went to the brief of Panhandle that Mr. Justice Rutledge was speaking to when he got to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.987" offset="8805644">It looked to me like he was just trying to tidy up this opinion and answer all the Panhandle's little complaints and he sure enough was doing that because Panhandle's brief was arguing that there might be a conflict between State Federal Power Commission, if this court were to hold that the state had jurisdiction of the rates and terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.820" offset="8924971">So, upon looking at Panhandle's brief lo and behold, we found that what they were talking about and therefore what we have to assume Mr. Justice Rutledge was talking about, was a preposition of the initial certification of a direct industrial sale, and unquestionably nobody said, that there is no quarrel in this case about their initial certificate authority as a transportation matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.597" offset="9036044">And that's what Mr. Justice Rutledge was talking about and it furnishes the FPC no comfort here whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.991" offset="9077631">Now, over to the Transco case, which I think is really the dispositive situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.076" offset="9117964">That case Your Honors, was a transportation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.046" offset="9141892">In that case an electric utility in New York state bought some gas down in Texas and wanted the pipeline company to haul it for them, transport it for them to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.537" offset="9191838">And the matter came before the FPC on a transportation certificate, the very thing that is in dispute here and the thing that they say, they have a continuing jurisdiction over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.183" offset="9274385">Now what did the FPC do there if they're ever going to be right, it would be in this case, and what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.620" offset="9300194">This court held just as squarely as can be, Chief Justice Warren said, “There is only a veto power in the transportation authority of the FPC, only a veto power.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.541" offset="9371874">And of course I think veto power implies initial power anyhow but those are Chief Justice Warren's exact words and then in less than one page later, he said, that the FPC as itself understands does not have allocation power, complete allocation power to use his exact words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.553" offset="9491933">So, Your Honors, it seems to us just as plain as can be from Panhandle and Transco, that you have the second peg in the FPC coffin because there is absolutely no authority in the FPC over a direct industrial sale or the transportation of gas for a direct industrial sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="2503.480" offset="10087629">In the City of Hastings case back in 1954 in Footnote 3 of that case, the court commented on the commission's statement that it had been to Congress, to recommend that it “extend our jurisdiction over interstate sales by natural gas companies to include direct sales to industries and sales to utilities which are not for resale.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.263" offset="10214793">That's the case you have before you today, that's us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.335" offset="10239035">The commission obviously didn't get that sort of authority, nothing had been done to the Act since 1954 and then up to 1963 we come, and we find that, in 1963, Mr. Swidler who was then the Chairman of the FPC and who has a reputation as a very knowledgeable man in this field, had this to say to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.256" offset="10346764">He is talking now to Congress and he says, “under existing law, the commission's authority is limited to sales for resale in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.164" offset="10390336">Hence the price and other terms,” that's my emphasis, “And other terms of a direct sale by pipeline to an industrial customer,” and that's us, “outside this field of this commission's regulatory authority.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.297" offset="10470898">That's the Chairman himself speaking and he then went on to ask Congress, to give them the authority to require that interstate industrial gas sales, that's us, will be made at such prices and on such terms as to realize the potential benefits of such sales to both industrial and domestic consumers and Congress turned him down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.598" offset="10584060">So, now we come up to 1970 and we are getting rather close up to date, and in 1970, this same commission that's appearing before this court and saying we have got this plenary authority, said to Congress that it's recommendation was that Congress enact “a new subsection to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, that would enable the commission to determine when an emergency exists, so as to require and now I am emphasizing lower curtailment and allocation,” That's what's being attempted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.887" offset="10733272">Low curtailment and allocation of gas by any gas company whether or not it is otherwise subject to the commission jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.401" offset="10767335">Now, the FPC says in its reply brief that the effort there was to reach distribution companies in intra state pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.681" offset="10808400">Now, Your Honors with all respect to the FPC and I am not saying this meanly but that's just solemn nonsense on their part because they already have a reach of distribution companies by way of their authority over the pipelines.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.573" offset="11207969">Oh, yes, I do think that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.542" offset="11231897">Now, I think I had just about finished saying what I had to say about the FPC actions themselves of going to Congress to ask for an authority that they are now saying to this Court that they have, and I think that the best evidence of an agency's lack of jurisdiction is the agency's own admission of that lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.286" offset="11338790">So I consider that the third peg in the FPC coffin here, and I turn at that point to the issue involved in what is known as a Green System.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.886" offset="11385288">And if Your Honors would refer to the first Appendix in our brief which is about midway, it's a foldout map and I assure to court that we have no idea here of emulating any popular magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.747" offset="11472641">But this foldout map shows, I think the location and the configuration of the Green System very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.173" offset="11522378">And Your Honors will note that the Green System lies in the very deep part of the, south part of Louisiana, which means you are really getting down south.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.403" offset="11575355">And that Green System, Your Honors, is a system that was designed and constructed to be an intrastate system, as you can see merely by looking at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.065" offset="11633974">And it's a self-contained separate system, and in the court below, by United's own witnesses, we were able to prove that this line is located wholly in Louisiana, the gas going into that launch produced wholly in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.444" offset="11719446">It's shipped wholly in Louisiana, it's consumed wholly in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.164" offset="11742329">We also show that there was 2.6% or 2.7% of gas from what's known as a Black System, which is an interstate line nearby.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.697" offset="11784439">It was artificially injected into that Green System by United in 1970, and I say artificially for this reason, the proof also shows that they need not have put that black gas into the Green System.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.692" offset="11844416">And indeed one of their wholly owned subsidiary companies breached some of its contracts in not putting enough green gas into the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.581" offset="11892063">And so you had a situation there where practically everything about it is intrastate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.689" offset="11936472">The Fifth Circuit looked at that whole situation and they on the teachings of the LoVaca case out of this Court, decided not as FPC has said to the Court today that this matter was de minimis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.633" offset="11996240">It's 2.6%, that had nothing to do with the holding actually.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.132" offset="12018183">The Court will find upon reading the Fifth Circuit decision that the decision on the Green System went off on what is known as the channel of constant flow which is a teaching coming out of the LoVaca case, also impliedly out of Amerada.</text>

            <text syncTime="3008.945" offset="12109507">Not at all, Mr. Chief Justice, because you have in the case of the Green System, a wholly different channel, there is a different pressure from the Black System.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.893" offset="12185262">Unlike in Florida Power where you had some interconnections, you see electricity is traveling on the same level, let's put it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.873" offset="12217236">Here, the pressure in the Green system is at a wholly different pressure than the Black System, so in order to put gas from the Black System into the Green System, you have to manipulate valves and push it into that system, and you can't get it back out of the Green System because the pressure is low.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.185" offset="12314411">So, this just guides you naturally into this theory of the channel of constant flow and that's what the Fifth Circuit went off on which was LoVaca all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.350" offset="12363103">Finally, on the Green System, I think we just get down to a case of common sense, Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3244.433" offset="13051378">When you look at the committee report itself, it says that the language but shall not apply to any say other transportation or sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.625" offset="13332142">Now, the Legislative History of 4008 specifically had, 4008 had a clause in it that said that this shall not apply to rates, charged to direct industrial usage, or any other rates, and when you look at the hearings, the whole issue was rate jurisdiction, and this commission was not given rate jurisdiction over retail rates regardless of who made the retail rates, whether it's distribution coming or direct, and we don't claim jurisdiction over rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.929" offset="13469441">This Court in the Transco, 365 U.S. 1, approximately at page 27 recognized that, that proviso was to take rate jurisdiction out, and these references to Chairman Swidler's testimony was when he was trying to get for the Federal Power Commission jurisdiction over the rates at which direct industrial sales were made because in a rate case of the Federal Power Commission now, we first allocate the cost of the direct industrial sales and throw them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.350" offset="13579051">And we don't consider them no further and we therefore set rates only to the sales for resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.068" offset="13601934">We exercised no rate jurisdiction over the direct industrial sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.951" offset="13617503">And the cases on Panhandle, this is the first I have heard that Panhandle dealt allocations of new service because Mr. Justice Rutledge said, appellant also envisions in conflicting regulations by the Commissions of the various states in its main pipeline serves particularly in relation to curtailment of service when weather conditions or others required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.874" offset="13713216">I don't believe Mr Justice Rutledge can fairly be talking about initial licensing, when he is talking about curtailment in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.342" offset="13755012">The Commission did report in its Annual Report in 1970 that it thought that it should have jurisdiction that compelled the interconnection regardless of whether it had jurisdiction over the pipeline, different types of customers because various distribution companies are occasionally served by more than one pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.334" offset="13827005">Some distribution companies now have their own imports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.487" offset="13839649">Some distribution companies have their own supplies of natural gas and that would supplement and augment our curtailment jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.252" offset="13874653">Mr. Justice White, 7 (b) does require.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.429" offset="13895446">United may not abandon a direct sale until it comes in and gets permission from the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.779" offset="13920837">The mere fact that the contract has expired does not permit an interstate pipeline from terminating any service. 7 (b) prohibits the termination of any service until the Commission has authorized it to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3534.746" offset="14212677">Over several years sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.782" offset="14216857">I don't recall, 6 or 7 years or perhaps even longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.458" offset="14235561">And then when the Commission found that seven pipelines are having to go to curtailment, fourteen pipelines had to buy emergency supplies of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.448" offset="14267534">When the Commission could anticipate that, that was happening and the interstate pipeline were unable to meet, the Commission ordered under Order 431, they ordered all pipelines to file new curtailment plans and the Commission now has some 26 of these pending in order to make a fair allocation of the interstate supplies of gas among the interstate pipelines not the intrastate pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.715" offset="14352589">With regard to the Green System, the Federal Power Commission intervened but all we could say to the Court when we intervened is, we have a proceeding pending in which we are taking evidence to determine what the jurisdictional status of this case is, and all of our evidence was this is what's pending before the Federal Power Commission until the Federal Power Commission completed the hearing, got the evidence, analyzed it, and took a position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.523" offset="14463766">We who intervened on behalf of the Commission were unable to say whether the system was jurisdictional or not, and their findings of the the Commission after review of the whole record was, that if the interstate supply of gas was shut off from that system, on a cold day 67% of the gas used in the New Orleans area would also be shut off.</text>
