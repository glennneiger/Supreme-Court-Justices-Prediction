            <text syncTime="19.524" offset="151781">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.112" offset="166096">This case is here on Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit which affirmed the dismissal of a pro se action brought by an Illinois prisoner against prison officials and others under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 seeking damages and other relief for injuries resulting from allegedly unconstitutional disciplinary treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.554" offset="255853">The District Court granted the respondent officials' motion to dismiss without allowing relief to amend or to amplify, without directing an answer from the defendants, without allowing discovery, without a point to counsel as some other person to assist the petitioner and without conducting any hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.230" offset="334638">The facts are basically as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.024" offset="345818">In 1968, Haines was then 66 years old, was an inmate of the Illinois State Penitentiary serving a life sentence imposed for burglary as habitual offender which was imposed in 1939.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley A. Bass</label>
            <text syncTime="84.921" offset="413319">At the time he had a foot disability for which he had been awarded compensation by the Illinois Industrial Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.197" offset="438501">On March 10 of 1968, Haines while on work detail was threatened by two younger inmates about 30 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.038" offset="469848">Statements were made by the other inmates to the effect that the young blood was taking over and that the old blood like Haines was dying.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.040" offset="501822">Haines did not immediately react to these torrents, but obtained an inmate pass to go outside and inspect the pile of cinders.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.631" offset="532228">When Haines reentered the shack, the two younger inmates resumed their arguments and their threats stating that Haines had better watch out or he would be hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.273" offset="566814">Again, Haines did not react.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.437" offset="579458">After Haines entered the bathroom, these other inmates approached him in a threatening manner and resumed the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.601" offset="608088">One of the two men asked him if he wanted to start something, he thinks of Dorothy and Haines then hit Dorothy with a shovel. Subsequently, there was a scuffle with Mr. Moore and after that Mr. Haines was taken by one of the officials of the prison to the solitary confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.855" offset="685097">Sometime after that which is not clear from the complaint, Mr. Haines was taken by the defendant Rogers to the disciplinary officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.234" offset="722609">Mr. Haines refused to explain his actions other then to acknowledge he had hit Dorothy with the shovel.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.221" offset="746537">He was locked again in an isolation cell until the report that he had from the defendant Duncan.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.022" offset="769734">Sometime after that, it is also not clear how long the period was, the report was submitted to the disciplinary committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.094" offset="802021">At that time Haines was brought before them and objected to certain statements regarding his hitting the shovel on the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.045" offset="833890">Haines had indicated that he had dislodged some dirt from the shovel and the defendant Lance wanted to know why plaintiff would hit Dorothy and stated that it been 28 years since Mr. Haines had been in the hole.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.837" offset="889061">When plaintiff refused to talk to these officers he was given 15 days punishment in solitary from March 10 to March 25, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.583" offset="928036">Mr. Haines described somewhat the conditions of the solitary.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.438" offset="943396">He said that it was a dark cell, that he had no bed or mattress, that he had to sleep on the floor on blankets, that he had received one regular meal during the afternoon and some bread in the morning and in the evening, that there were no personal articles of hygiene, specifically no soap or towel and that his false teeth became so rancid he had to take them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.511" offset="1027719">Following his day in solitary confinement, Mr. Haines was demoted to C grade which meant that he lost certain commissary privileges and other privileges which Haines said are not known to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.561" offset="1075889">Although in discovery Haines filed numerous requests for admissions and interrogatories where he sought to ascertain more information along that line.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.410" offset="1123327">The issues in the case are first whether or not the District Court prematurely dismissed the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.971" offset="1149554">Secondly, whether the totality of the circumstances of this particular solitary confinement as applied for this particular inmate unjustified on this record violated Haines' right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.782" offset="1204829">Third, whether Haines was effectively precluded from making a defense or self-defense at the disciplinary proceeding and finally there is a question of whether or not Haines was penalized for exercising his right to remain silent until the existence of any immunity was fairly demonstrated to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.523" offset="1275778">The issues that are not involved in this case are a general attack upon solitary confinement per se under humane conditions and secondly whether or not the application of Goldberg versus Kelly type of procedures apply to all disciplinary proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.022" offset="1333769">We deal in this situation with the specific problem where a man is charged with a prosecutable offense where a self-incrimination question must be dealt with.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stanley A. Bass</label>
            <text syncTime="368.937" offset="1549436">The District Court summarily dismiss under the motion of the defendants to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.476" offset="1567618">So there is no evidence on which we can (Inaudible) –-</text>
            <text syncTime="378.619" offset="1588202">The only thing we have the allegations of the complaint which are taken us true for present purposes which must be liberally construed in accordance with pro se of willing rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.085" offset="1638044">Quoting from the Supreme Court pronouncements in Jackson versus Bishop, Mr. Justice Blackmun pointed out that the meaning of the Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dignity of man that it is a flexible guarantee drawing meaning from evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, wanton infliction of pain and unnecessary cruelty are barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.294" offset="1730831">Significantly a statement is made there that brought an idealistic concept of dignity, civilized standards, humanity and decency are useful and usable and as we point out, the practices of other jurisdictions, standards of the American Correctional Association, the United Nations Minimum Standards and the views of experts show that these concepts are also practical and workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.270" offset="1838769">This Court has not hesitated to strike down state penal practices which contravene federal constitutional guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.046" offset="1865831">Younger versus Gilmore, Cruz versus Hope, Johnson versus Avery, Cooper versus Pate and Lee versus Washington, all involved the cases where state penal practices were held to be inconsistent with the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.810" offset="1920898">It appears that the respondents do fall back to the position that the action taken here was actually necessary to the maintenance of prison discipline and security.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.524" offset="1959768">But interestingly there is no evidence in this record to support that conclusion and that is another reason why the case needs to be remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.069" offset="1993936">They suggest possible abuse of facilities by a person in solitary confinement as an abstract possibility, but nowhere as it is suggested, as the Second Circuit pointed out in Wright versus McMinn, that a determination had been made administratively that Haines was a person that would have abused those facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.673" offset="2064362">Accordingly, the case must be remanded to ascertain whether or not such a determination had ever been made and it should be noted in this connection that there are alternatives to the type of punishment that was imposed upon Haines.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.247" offset="2118697">This would be entitled to some weight in determining whether or not the inflictions in this case were actually necessary for prison discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.957" offset="2149521">As the President’s Crime Commission pointed out in 1967, one of the things that could be done in a situation involving misbehavior is that the inmate should be contacted by members of the staff concerned with this classification in counseling which can include chaplains, case workers and persons of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.225" offset="2226530">They should discuss with him the causes and consequences of his misbehavior trying to reach agreement on what the causes are and how they may be corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.207" offset="2262475">So that instead of blandly imposing a subtle or not so subtle form of corporal punishment, they ought to try to get through to the man’s mind and find out why his attitudes are the way they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.576" offset="2303957">In this case, it is quite possible that would finally ascertain that Haines was reacting in self-defense and was not the aggressor.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.843" offset="2341051">And as we find from some of the returns to our questionnaire from some of the departments of corrections, many persons are saying we use solitary confinement only as a last resort when other alternatives are not availing.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.453" offset="2395490">Perhaps one approach that –-</text>

            <text syncTime="581.821" offset="2400924">Would you clarify for me Mr. Bass, I am a little confused by something that you just said.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.686" offset="2428405">What happened when they undertook to make an inquiry into the incident of hitting the other prisoner over the head with shovel?</text>

          <turn speaker="stanley_a_bass" startTime="597.169" stopTime="772.452">
            <label>Mr. Stanley A. Bass</label>
            <text syncTime="597.169" offset="2462364">Well he refused to explain his actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.198" offset="2470514">I will get to that in a moment as to why he was affectively precluded from talking about self-defense at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.386" offset="2499249">That is the second point involving due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.168" offset="2510325">With respect to the first point, perhaps the best approach would be for this Court to adopt the procedure utilized in the Eastern District of Arkansas with respect the whipping cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.418" offset="2551389">First case, Tally versus Stevens held that there must be procedural safeguards surrounding the infliction of corporal punishment in order to minimize abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.864" offset="2589110">Interestingly, none are shown here.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.178" offset="2598409">That is we do not know whether or not they are Illinois regulations requiring a doctor to certify that a person is fit to take certain types of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.496" offset="2635608">There is no showing that there is administrative review of low racial armed personnel nor that any showing that Haines' physical condition was given any weight whatsoever in the determination that he should be subjected to this type of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.252" offset="2686703">Of course this is a determination for the prison officials not the Courts to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.375" offset="2703213">However, there is no showing that prison officials made such an informed showing on this record, and therefore, the case must be remanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.080" offset="2734037">As the Fourth Circuit pointed out in Brown versus Payton while the judgments of prison officials are entitled to considerable weight, prison officials are not judges and are not charged with responsibility of enforcing the constitution and they are not always disinterested persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.558" offset="2799866">We do not denigrate there views, but cannot be absolutely bound by them.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.783" offset="2820764">The second approach that might be taken would be to hold as in Jackson versus Bishop that there are such practices that so contravene civilized standards as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.737" offset="2868620">For example, there is no showing at all that any legitimate interest is served by keeping people in dark cells.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.296" offset="2894847">Nor is there any showing that prisons could not be loaned the personal articles of hygiene which is then be returned back to the officials so that a person would not be able to make weapons or razor blades or things of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.247" offset="2946674">Nor is there any showing that it is impossible to construct the bed that cannot be taken apart by a prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.500" offset="2967676">Nor is there a showing that it is impossible to have medical visitation or to have exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.875" offset="2989201">But we think that a remand should be held in this case in order to fully develop the record as to exactly what alternatives were available to the state and whether or not the inflictions in this case were actually necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.751" offset="3036640">We are not seeking final judgment here, but only a chance to prove that Haines was in effect treated as rubbish.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.820" offset="3064956">The second claim which is the procedural due process claim is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.327" offset="3090974">Mr. Haines points out that no statement of reasons was ever given for the punishment and there is the chance that he may have been penalized for exercising his right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.578" offset="3132039">He was under dilemma of talking and possibly incriminating himself or not talking and thereby suffering punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="954.870" offset="3893143">There, there was a man on Federal parole that was arrested for a new offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.548" offset="3907876">It was sort of continuance of the Federal parole revocation proceeding on the ground he might incriminate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.804" offset="3928878">The Circuit Court said there was no need for a continuance because they would adopt an implicit use immunity rule saying anything that he said in the revocation proceeding would be ipso facto inadmissible in the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.550" offset="3975898">Under those circumstances that removes the legitimate fear self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.600" offset="3992094">If it has been fairly demonstrated to the prisoner that he has no Fifth Amendment problem, he could then talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.750" offset="4016649">In this situation there is no showing that Haines do of any implicit use immunity nor that he was advised by this.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.307" offset="4042876">Now, the appointment of counsel might suffice or simple admonition by the administrative officials might suffice.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.019" offset="4065760">On this record we certainly cannot presume a waiver that he intentionally relinquished that right knowing that he had such a right and under the circumstances the case must be remanded for a determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.751" offset="4120721">In addition, while Haines raised a question as to whether or not his good time was properly taken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.913" offset="4153322">We think candidly that, that issue really is not relevant to this case for the following reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.996" offset="4173698">In Illinois life prisoners are entitled to be considered for parole at the end of 20 years minus good time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.334" offset="4198984">But Haines did not need that good time because his 20 years were up in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.904" offset="4217270">Therefore, the only question related to his release is whether or not the parole board might have taken this disciplinary proceeding into consideration in denying him parole in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.939" offset="4269410">For the Court’s information, Mr. Haines in June of 1971 was paroled effective July 6, contingent upon acceptance by the Veteran’s Hospital if the detainer was not exercised against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.133" offset="4322178">Well, unfortunately the Veteran’s Hospital has not chosen to accept him and that is the problem that remains to be worked up, but he still has a damage claim in this case that must be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.987" offset="4369616">He does say that he suffered physical injuries and pain and suffering as result of being in that solitary cell and under the circumstances that he has a clear right under Section 1983 under Monroe versus Pape to come into this Court and seek relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.931" offset="4433355">If there are no further questions, I will save my remaining time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1106.990" offset="4501587">In June of 1968, petitioner filed a pro se civil rights complaint in the District Court of the Northern District of Illinois Eastern District.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.793" offset="4540875">In addition to the facts that Mr. Bass has already laid out, I would like add the additional facts that were presented by the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.936" offset="4589463">Haines was 65 and he was working in the yarding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.577" offset="4600016">There was a verbal disagreement between himself and other inmates and in response to this verbal disagreement, Haines struck another inmate over the head with a shovel, a dissent that was observed by another inmate by the name of Orlando, a prison official who was close at hand came to the incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.554" offset="4699908">He administered first aid to the inmate that was struck over the head with a shovel then called for the disciplinary lieutenant of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.954" offset="4737525">There is a procedure at Menard Penitentiary to walk serious rule infractors to the Disciplinary Captain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.576" offset="4767931">When Mr. Haines was walked to the Disciplinary Captain, he admitted the violation of a serious rule to penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.436" offset="4799383">He admitted to the lieutenant that he struck another inmate over the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.120" offset="4822161">In response to this admission, Mr. Haines was placed in what Menard calls a holing cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.984" offset="4849642">Mr. Haines calls it isolation; we will accept that as true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.971" offset="4865525">On the same day, an investigation took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.263" offset="4882765">On the same day March 10, 1968, Mr. Haines was given a hearing in front of two captains, one was lieutenant one was the captain who were not involved in original incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.329" offset="4938981">The investigation report of the guy who made the investigation was presented to Mr. Haines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.248" offset="4962700">He was confronted with the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.172" offset="4974403">He had the opportunity to rebut the investigation or in the alternative to explain his actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.199" offset="5010452">He took advantage of that by making what he felt were minor changes in the investigation report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.626" offset="5044202">In fact he said “Well, I did not bang the shovel on the yard room floor as investigation presents, but I will answer no further questions.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1364.168" offset="5530393">He also alleged his false teeth became rancid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.537" offset="5543872">The first issue I would like to address myself to is whether the hearing or the procedure in which the penitentiary disciplined Mr. Haines complied with due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.244" offset="5590684">The majority of Federal Circuits who have examined this problem have concluded that as long as the punishment is not posed arbitrarily or capriciously, it comports with due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.503" offset="5647735">This Court has stated in several cases that the fundamental requisite of due process is a meaningful opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.508" offset="5683680">The meaningful opportunity to be heard is a relative concept depending on the capacities of those to be heard and the circumstances of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.063" offset="5721923">This Court has also noted that where a specific proceeding is required, the nature of that proceeding would depend on the nature of the alleged right involved, the nature of the proceeding and the possible burdens inflicted on the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.092" offset="5786080">I think when we look at the facts as pleaded by Haines and by the way I viewed approximately 800 civil rights complaints while I had been working for the Attorney General and Mr. Haines was not only articulate pro se a litigant, but he had pled his facts well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.860" offset="5857133">He was very specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.871" offset="5865178">There is no evidence that Mr. Haines is inarticulate, not intelligent or incapable of presenting his own complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.500" offset="7183631">Notwithstanding if he says habeas corpus and if it is really civil rights or vice versa, the Federal Court should apply the plurality there, but not plead facts for the individual and Mr. Haines was very specific throughout his complaint concerning the allegation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1815.078" offset="7333991">I think it is fair to both parties and you are not doing an injustice to a liberal construction to require, the Federal Courts, to merely rule in the facts as pleaded and I think what is logical here is to show the facts they were not pleaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.227" offset="7390625">They are balanced of against the facts that were in concluding whether under the total circumstances the incarceration of Haines was cruel and unusual punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.350" offset="8047030">There are clearly two issues under the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.937" offset="8061449">Was it merely disproportionate and/or was the implementation unnecessary and painful?</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.791" offset="8092796">This Court has looked at four factors in determining whether punishment is cruel and unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.479" offset="8115575">If you look at the history of similar or the same punishment, it compared what other jurisdictions are doing in the similar situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.986" offset="8157580">If look at the case law and finally they have contemporary standards of decency under all four tests, the present punishment was not cruel and unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.960" offset="8209511">There is no question that in the 1780s when the Eighth Amendment – when the Eighth Amendment was enacted, the use of isolation, silence and hard labor was the quakers (ph) humane alternative to the former sanguinary punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.152" offset="8302298">The law in that state prison initially started using isolation one-twentieth to one-half of the confinement of individuals that were sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.995" offset="8353707">Now subsequently, the different penitentiaries through out the country in the early 1780s, found that prolonged use of isolation was detrimental to the health of the individual so they discontinued the continued use of isolation, but up to 1840 and both the Auburn Penitentiary Systems and Pennsylvania Penitentiary Systems which was the two main penitentiary systems in the 1830s and 40s, isolation was continued in use for part of the sentence for serious violators of the criminal law and also for the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.059" offset="8509920">In fact, John Howard who was the father of all penological reform in the early 1770s suggested the use of isolation for serious rule infractions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.006" offset="8557671">There is not question that historically the framers of the Eighth Amendment did not intend that this type of punishment should be circumscribed by the cruel and unusual clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.252" offset="8606677">The Court might take judicial notice of many of the Federal Court's opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.704" offset="8628516">Isolation is the common measure for discipline in penitentiaries throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.695" offset="8656414">Now, the Court should be careful because not all jurisdictions use the term solitary or isolation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.081" offset="8678044">They may have a different term, but the effect is the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="2292.350" offset="9243125">They have noted the custom -- custody, discipline and security are the primary functions of the penitentiary and only if you have proper control of the inmates can you have an effective rehabilitative system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.912" offset="9305296">American Correctional Association notes that isolation is acceptable form of discipline and they circumscribe it by the following limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.174" offset="9346360">No more than 15 days at a time. You should a toilet and a wash basin, but they observe that not all isolations cells need a toilet and wash basin because it is been their experience that certain inmates for causes unknown or causes known would go in and break things up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.747" offset="9420653">They will tear up toilets, they will stuff towels down the toilet seat, there will be an overflow, and they will burn the mattresses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.728" offset="9448551">There may be on restricted diet of an individual here who has access to limited space.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.699" offset="9476450">As to the claim not completely dark, they observe –- well they acknowledge it shall not be wholly dark, well-heated and ventilated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.335" offset="9530994">If we take a look at a situation we will observe that the prison really had no viable alternative than to use isolation and I think the Court should keep in mind that when you are comparing whether this isolation or the hole, whatever terminology you use is cruel and unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.007" offset="9597658">It is not logical to compare the confinement to your bedroom or living room at home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.106" offset="9622109">It should be a relative comparison.</text>

            <text syncTime="2442.529" offset="9843836">At least it is not an issue whether he did have a shower and a shower once a week and a shave that means he had two showers and two shaves, does not make the absence of a towel soap cruel and unusual punishment in my estimation, especially I think the test here is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.131" offset="9906217">The penitentiary has 1200 inmates in there and I think it is reasonable for the penitentiary to set up a situation which will meet the average individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="2477.525" offset="9983748">At the hearing, the Disciplinary Captain had the opportunity to observe his physical demeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.664" offset="10012378">So when they placed the inmate in there without towel and soap, I think it is reasonable to conclude that they could be used as a garret.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.260" offset="10046756">They could place the soap in a towel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.936" offset="10057414">That is a very effective blackjack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.923" offset="10069325">So when you compare the interest of the penitentiary to prevent their guards from serious attack and at the same time determining whether or not he was subjected to inhumane punishment, I think the opportunity that he has a shower does not convert the mere absence of towel and soap a cruel and unusual punishment especially when he was provided with adequate food.</text>

            <text syncTime="2706.236" offset="10898661">Well, it was not a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.919" offset="10905348">The point I am trying to make, they had no viable alternative even though it may affect his parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.124" offset="10942129">At that time, they had only three alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.708" offset="10952473">No punishment, minor withdrawal rights, or isolation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.738" offset="10972640">So I think it is logical to say isolation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.576" offset="10979954">Now, the question for this Court to answer, was the implementation of isolation reasonable?</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.958" offset="11001479">I think when you compare the requirements of discipline, the requirements of the penitentiary for custody and security, when you bounce at against fairness to the individual, I believe the answer is that this was not cruel and unusual punishment even though you personally may disagree what had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.170" offset="11078383">I do not believe, only the Courts have not so founded that that is a test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.295" offset="11098863">Most recent penological advancements are not the test in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.661" offset="11112343">The fact that there was other alternative does not make this cruel and unusual because within an area the prison should have discretion to apply what they feel is appropriate in the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.789" offset="11168871">I think in summary and conclusion, I submit that since petitioner was disciplined in a fair manner, no question about that and he received punishment that was only a workable humane alternative available to the prison authorities under circumstances, this Court should affirm the dismissal of petitioner’s complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="2800.350" offset="11275033">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.433" offset="11287363">The respondents are not asking this Court to act as a Trial Court by bringing in exhibits or by making certain statements about policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.045" offset="11317874">Our position is that the case should be remanded so that a full record could be made in the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.871" offset="11341175">Secondly, it is our position that the state does not have a right to jeopardize inmate's health without showing necessity, without showing some reliable procedural safeguards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.499" offset="11379627">It is not irrelevant to know the effect upon any potential rehabilitation as the point that Jackson versus Fischer pointed out when a inmate perceives cruel and unusual punishment, it makes it much more difficult to socialize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.882" offset="11433231">Our the final remark is that with respect to such questions to shave and shower, Haines did allege “there was no articles of hygiene” furnished to him and it would seem to me under a liberal construction that one might then put the burden on the state to come forward and say exactly what you did supply him and under the circumstances we feel that the record must be developed more fully and that the case should be remanded to the District Court, thank you.</text>
