            <text syncTime="58.751" offset="308737">I wonder before you begin, the Attorney General of Florida has filed a suggestion which as I read it says that this exemption is no longer available under Florida Law and this is to which I wish, if you would, you particularly address this up.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.673" offset="396403">It says that under Florida Law, this particular property even if there is a reversal cannot be subjected to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.414" offset="431303">Is that right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="89.956" offset="433497">Yes, not quite -- I have addressed myself to the question of mootness in my reply brief which I filed in this Court. Specifically to that exclusive issue but I will briefly state that why I believe this case is not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.634" offset="484175">The first case, the new amendatory law is not yet in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.123" offset="506222">It takes effect next year, December 31st of this year which means the next fiscal year.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.704" offset="532554">And so that the tax for this year at very least is before the Court, so it is not moot at least --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="121.190" offset="558467">Let me see now, you mean even if the tax, it we were to reverse and the tax for the past years is not collectible, you say it is collectible?</text>

            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="130.845" offset="597024">For this year because the statute itself, the very less says it shall not take effect until next year.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.837" offset="628998">So you will find that in the suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.420" offset="639342">You will find that on the very last page 15 of the suggestion of the Attorney General, the State of Florida which has a text of the amendatory statute, actually will take effect December 31st, 1971 which means the next year and not for the current year.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.880" offset="709246">So that -- it is a very minimum, it is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.193" offset="722412">There is also a Florida statute which says, if any tax which is not collected for any reason, is there after determined to be payable, the taxpayer is liable for the three years past taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.745" offset="908717">I think that under the decision of this Court in (Inaudible), a determination that the plaintiffs here, assume this taxpayer is planning to sue means that they have been individually harmed by the exemption and while the State of Florida can if it wishes to provide the future of the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.710" offset="996488">At least as far as the tax was accrued, while this suit is pending at the very least, the very least, the plaintiff by his factor, he has standing, has the pressure to agree with him even though the tax is never collectible.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.119" offset="1050196">Well, the tax may be collectible, presumably within the power of this Court as a Court of equity.</text>

            <text syncTime="265.212" offset="1134519">Well, I would say that under the First Amendment, the plaintiffs would have a suit in the Court, to compel them to pay the tax as a redress for wront that he committed, an equitable cause of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.172" offset="1190421">In any event the issue, it is collectible as I indicated that the issue is one of national importance or else the Court would not have noted it.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="315.488" offset="1335662">So, you do not think it is necessary, do you think it would be an appropriate case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leo_pfeffer" startTime="319.749" stopTime="934.306">
            <label>Mr. Leo Pfeffer</label>
            <text syncTime="319.749" offset="1352694">No, Mr. Chief Justice, I do not think so, because I think if the Florida Court, as I indicated in my brief, if the Florida Court would say that the tax is not collectible retroactively, I would say that is to raise a federal issue, a federal question whether that Florida, the State of Florida can deprive a taxpayer of that equitable remedy anymore than to deprive him a right to sue originally because it is a federal question and not the State question.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.977" offset="1469618">Now, the question -- the specifics of this case is a Florida statute is which as pointed out has been amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.890" offset="1517266">Now there is a difference between myself and the Attorney for the other plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.624" offset="1544224">We do not challenge the constitutionality of the amendatory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.174" offset="1566376">The amendatory statute says, when a piece of property owned by a Church is used partly for church purposes and partly for non commercial purposes, that part which is used, that should be prorate tax on that part which is used for non or to the extent that is used for commercial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.454" offset="1647460">Mr. Hollander representing the plaintiff, is of the opinion that end use of it destroys the entire exemption, we do not have to go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.176" offset="1690405">We concede, at least for the purpose of this case that to the extent that the statute prorates the taxability to that extent, it is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.487" offset="1743590">Now the question presented to this Court is whether this Court’s decision on Walz which upheld the exemptibility of property owned by a church and used exclusively for religious purposes extends to property which is used for in least , in part, purely in the secular field of commercial competition enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.071" offset="1842020">The sole relationship to the church being that all of the profits of it go to the church.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.283" offset="1866784">It was our contention that nothing in the Walz case requires its extension to this particular case and the issue was specifically not before the Court then.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.737" offset="1916626">In Walz the Court recognized and rejected the argument there presented that tax exemption represented the first step inevitable progression, the Court said, the history of tax exemption for 200 years shows there has not been an inevitable progression in breaking down the wall of separation between church and State.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.390" offset="2015264">If your Honor please, this case shows that perhaps the Court was a little too optimistic in Walz because this is a further step.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.917" offset="2049328">Unlike the Walz situation, this does not have the support of 200 years of uniform universal practice about which the Court both in the Court’s opinion and Congress' opinion relied large measure in Walz.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.601" offset="2116097">It showed that ever since our constitution was written, in every state, the union including the Federal Government, land used exclusively for religious purposes was exempt and the Court pointed out and this Congress' opinion pointed out, as the Holmes statement, that this history is worth volumes of logic and should be great width.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.099" offset="2206062">The history here is just the reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.368" offset="2215153">The history here shows, and I pointed out in our brief, that even as far back as 1217, there was this device of turning all the property to a religiously owned property for non-religious use as a means of avoiding the obligations of feudalism and what today would be the functional equivalent of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.525" offset="2303760">Now, it is our contention that a statute which exempts a church from those burdens which every secular commercial institution bears in its operation, the commercial area is inevitably a statute whose purpose or certainly its effect, whatever its purpose, its primary effect is the advancement of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.577" offset="2419953">To that extent it is subject to the restrictions of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.254" offset="2446702">Now in Walz, the Court noted aside from the historical background of tax exemption that the distinctive state would be an alternative though, taxed the church in which case, there will have to be some entanglement of the state and church affairs or do not tax it in which case the entanglement if any will be considerably less.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.163" offset="2566343">And the rationale of the Court, as I see is, if you ask my opinions as I see is this, that prima facie at the very least, a statute by the State which advances religion or aids religion is prima facie subject to constitutional, at least scrutiny, strong scrutiny, and it is only if you can show as was, certain in Walz that there was a countervailing factor that to tax would impose another evil which the First Amendment was sought to avoid, the evil of entanglement, then we will allow the exemption rather than invoke the entanglement.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.319" offset="2734990">Now in the case that is decided since we wrote the brief in this case, the Lemon, and DiCenso, and Tilton cases, the Court molded that the Walz case did not intend and it did not expand the scope of governmental, of permissible governmental aids religion but restricted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.168" offset="2818372">And the Court noted, particularly in Tilton which involved the collegiate and the Court held that that part of the federal law which said that after 20 years, a college which receives support funds to build a facility may use it for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.755" offset="2900710">That part of it the Court unanimously, there was no Court’s opinion in Tilton that was (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="711.967" offset="2921504">But all my Justices agreed that to that extent at least that statute was unconstitutional, there was some value which existed after 20 years and the State could not or the Federal Government could not aid or advance religion to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.689" offset="2996423">Even though it would mean continuing surveillance and entanglement after 20 years because the statute, the (Inaudible) forbids the use of those facilities and federal funds to be for sectarian teaching or religious worship.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.794" offset="3084821">So that the government agents after 20 years would still have to keep an eye on that facility to make sure it was not used for religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.049" offset="3121915">Thus quite clearly indicating although there seems to be an impression which I do not believe is valid that the Eversen rule has been buried that government may aid religion, I do not know if any case would so hold but it is quite clear that Tilton and Lemon, DiCenso do not allow a government aid to religion absent of some countervailing factor such as in Walz entanglement in Everson, the welfare of children were protected from the accidents -- of the hazards of the roads and that type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.142" offset="3266216">Now, and our contention here is that the amount of entanglement involved in financing the commercial activities of a religious group is minimum and that it is far outweighed by the other factors which call for constitutional restriction upon that aid or benefit to religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.939" offset="3369452">One of the things which we believe should be considered by the Court which the Court noted both in Walz and in Lemon and DiCenso, that one of the things, one of the major evils, the First Amendment was aimed at -- of wordings, was that the Court “the potential for political divisiveness along religious or divisive political potential that the fathers of the First Amendment were afraid and they had a whole history of 2,000 years of political confidence and decisiveness, because of religion that a church is seeking certain benefits and the church in return is seeking to control the statement and trying to control the church.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.235" offset="3566624">We contend that this type of legislation which puts a competitive advantage in the business world in favor of churches necessarily bring to that type of divisive political potential which this Court wanted to get both in Walz and repeated it Lemon against DiCenso.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.799" offset="3668919">The acrimony, the bitterness, the feelings of a grudge locks on there and across the street from downtown, that owned by the church, that the church does not have to pay a tax and therefore can undercut it whereas he has to pay a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.965" offset="3745510">That kind of political divisiveness, that kind of reaction towards a favoritism for the church is one of the dangers which I believe the First Amendment was intended to evoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.003" offset="3809667">Now --</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.762" offset="4112688">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.075" offset="4137974">The case is of course one involving the separation of Church and State and is in fact a progression of the Walz decision decided last year by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.892" offset="4189279">I do not premise my thinking on this case on the Everson decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.911" offset="4209341">I believe that my position in this is case would be squarely met with the dictates of not only Walz but the three cases decided this year, DiCenso, Tilton and Lemon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.373" offset="4283215">This Court has said in those three cases, as well as Walz that there are three main evils in which the establishment clause attempted to prevent and that was financial aid sponsorship and active involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.708" offset="4340475">And we measured those three evils by three tests, we are told.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.523" offset="4359806">And the tests are whether or not there is a valid secular legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.322" offset="4378928">The second was a test decided in the DiCenso which is whether or not the primary effect either inhibits or advances the religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.901" offset="4409334">And the third test is whether or not there is excessive entanglement or active involvement.\</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.829" offset="4437024">I think that the case before you, Honors is clearly was not involving a valid secular legislative purpose as seen in the Walz decision where there was discussion in the Court opinion concerning the pluralism of religions and the good works of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.802" offset="4516854">Certainly that is not involved where we have a commercial parking lot and that incidentally is exactly what it is, were involved with a square block in the city of Miami which occupies a 127,500 sq. ft. of which 75,000 sq. ft. is this commercial parking lot, Monday through Saturdays, is all stipulation of fact but it is not contested facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.388" offset="4599192">We are up here on stipulation of that, Monday through Saturday, each and everyday other than Sunday, this religious institution rents out this lot other than to those particular lots within the 290 which are used for persons who might want to attend church that day for a choir meeting or a directors meeting of some kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.351" offset="4687068">Other than the portion which might be used for someone who might have some business, Monday through Saturday in a church, the entire rest of this lot, 75,000 sq. ft., 290 parking spaces is rented out commercially six days out of seven days a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.246" offset="4754673">This is stipulation of fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.061" offset="5425915">I do think that we have some very important things to decide and that is certainly the valid leg -- secular legislative purpose is not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.092" offset="5458098">And we come to primary effect and I noted the language in Tilton, I think that is extremely important because Tilton was cited on the bases that the buildings were strictly secular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.339" offset="5495088">There were no religious symbols, there was no permeation of religion on a higher institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.349" offset="5511075">It was strictly secular use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.842" offset="5517030">So the Court was concerned with the use of these facilities or what is the use of this facility?</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.119" offset="5538137">Six days out of seven days each week they rent out this parking lot and they take in a profit out of competitive advantage because they do not pay taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.748" offset="5568648">So if the use of the property is to be any kind of criteria as apparently it was not the Tilton decision where the building were strictly secular and the Court dwelled on that fact and certainly the use of this property commercially with cast within the terms of the establishment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.744" offset="5632701">And certainly also within the terms of what this Court discussed in the Tilton decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.469" offset="5663525">I also think that the entanglement that we get involved in which this Court discussed in a three decision this year and the Walz decision last year is present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.573" offset="5715979">The kind of political divisiveness which this Court says if not inherent in our people is certainly involved in this case after all we have certain Court that attempted to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.155" offset="5758297">We have a Supreme Court of Florida that got a raised at the Circuit Court in reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.116" offset="5774180">We have legislation there so we do not like the Supreme Court decisions all through out the statutes and say but next year we will go into new statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.908" offset="5801347">We have a raging controversy in Florida over this lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.874" offset="5813155">And a very political divisiveness which this Court seeks to prevent is exactly what we have with the commercial parking lot in Miami.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.385" offset="5843248">Now, is it a commercial parking lot or it is something else?</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.183" offset="5854428">The District Court down there said it was commercial parking lot, they held as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.399" offset="5875326">Does the holding in Walz versus Tax Commissioner supra that there is no establishment of religion and no inhibition of the free exercise religion in a State Taxation Scheme which exempts from taxation property use “exclusively for religious proposes”, i.e. religious property used solely for religious worship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.322" offset="5942931">Encompass a tax exemption in the instant case as it applies to Church property used as a commercial parking lot, we answer affirmatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.579" offset="5976054">So they have concluded it is commercial parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.554" offset="5983891">But why have they decided it is okay a novel institution, another constitutional principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.491" offset="6003639">They said because the proceeds go to a worthwhile charitable recipient based on Walz and the Court based their decision on Walz.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.548" offset="6039897">And the recipient, we are going to hold that it is perfectly alright because there is a worthwhile recipient even though we hold it a commercial parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.879" offset="6069155">I think that is a novel, well because I have never seen any establishment case really that looked at whether or not that worthwhile recipient was such as to permit it within the establishment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.918" offset="6109383">And incidentally the very kind of entanglement is inherent in that kind of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.167" offset="6134356">After all, the sight of Government Auditors, Government Inspectors and daily surveillance running through Church records each day to determine where the funds were traced to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.831" offset="6176988">Was it or not a worthwhile recipient?</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.604" offset="6192139">That is the very kind as I understand it, surveillance which this Court says is not proper under the establishment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.586" offset="6220038">So the very decision of the US District Court calls for the kind of surveillance which is traced the funds and with this worthwhile, fine, it is not worthwhile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.007" offset="6257759">Then we do something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.206" offset="6266536">Now, I think along these very same lines and counsel and I may have difference here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.334" offset="6287016">I think we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.636" offset="6292240">The new statute which is going to go into effect next year is even worse than this one because the new statute says, well, whether we will break it off at 50% and if it is less than 50% we will prorate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.592" offset="6348038">So the Government auditors or inspectors for daily policing of going through the records of the Church of this 290 spaces and it was like, you use this space Monday, Wednesday and Friday for commercial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.253" offset="6394745">Use this space, Tuesday and Thursday for religious purposes and they will have to go, how many spaces were used for religious purposes?</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.544" offset="6419822">How many for commercial purposes?</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.568" offset="6427972">And the very surveillance, the very abhorrent kind of degrading situation not only for the Government but for the religious institution is inherent in the new formula.</text>

            <text syncTime="2121.140" offset="8558206">It is true that the Supreme Court of Florida said that while the City could not be compelled to collect taxes for the three years prior to the commencement of the litigation that they could collect taxes for the years during which the litigation proceeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.163" offset="8634379">So in so far as the plaintiffs make the contention that at least the current year’s tax is still at issue at least that much because a Court order could change the roles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.017" offset="8701775">My answer to that is that the doctrine of equitable stopple as it has been applied in the Coppock case and the City of Naples case would clearly result in a decision by the Supreme Court of Florida that these -- the tax commissioner here cannot change their minds.</text>

            <text syncTime="3070.696" offset="12356515">Now, there have been in our history certain efforts now and then to change this rule and to require particularly the churches to be dependent on free will offerings may each year and only on those offering.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.052" offset="12433941">But no jurisdiction has ever adopted that particular rule of Law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3292.310" offset="13242901">And there is no State, no Florida State income tax or at least has not been for a while?</text>

            <text syncTime="3297.264" offset="13262755">Not that I know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.688" offset="13276443">So the parental problem and say the unrelated business income problem here is that the debt or the answer to it simply that the federal statute excludes from the definitions of an unrelated business income derived from interests from dividends, from rentals and from royalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.157" offset="13346346">But let us consider for moment the choice that the State faces in this area of Taxation and exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.532" offset="13379783">It has only two choices, one, to tax or other not to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.541" offset="13403816">Appellants assert that not taxing helps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.615" offset="13424191">If they are correct in that contention despite of the language of the Walz case which rejects that concept that an exemption involved sponsorship for active assistance, but if they are correct in saying that an exemption helps than extends the reason that taxation purpose and the doctrine of the Everson case and of the subsequent explanations and elaborations of that case is not that the Government cannot aid the Churches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.114" offset="13562118">It is that the Government cannot neither help nor hurt certainly not on purpose and neither help nor hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.249" offset="13606735">And in the phase of this mandate of the First Amendment, what is the Government to do when it cannot avoid one or the other?</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.885" offset="13653233">No I think this is a false dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.483" offset="13659607">I think that the Walz opinion quite correctly rejected the concept that the exemption amounted to positive sponsorship of a church or direct active assistance to the church.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.816" offset="13724913">What the Government has faced with the legislatures faced with here is four types of organizations, Governmental Organizations, private for profit organizations, charitable non profit organizations and churches and religious organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.757" offset="13792727">Now in the choice between taxing and not taxing when it comes to the Governmental Organization, the Government is certainly not going to tax unless it engages in some budget bookkeeping, a shifting of the burden – of -- of long different elements of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.619" offset="13860123">With the private for a profit organizations, the Federal Government, the Federal Government and the States have elected to tax and when the charitable non-profit organizations, the Federal Government and the State Governments have elected not to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.974" offset="13937550">Now when the come to the churches and the religious Organizations which of this three categories are Churches and to religious organizations which of these three categories are churches most like, well, they are certainly not governmental organizations and there is certainly not drive organizations under the legal concept of a private for profit Organizations because of they were, they would not qualify under the legal concept of a Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.778" offset="14020828">So they are much more similar to a charitable non-profit organizations than to anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.939" offset="14045488">And in view of the facts that many of Churches do engage in charitable activities in addition to the basic worship and preaching that they do it is eminently sensible for a legislature to treat Churches and religious organizations in the same way that it treats charitable non-profit organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.731" offset="14140573">But there is more to this than just reasonable mess because our historical tradition shows that this is the choice that all of the States and the Federal Government have in fact made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.348" offset="14203058">And if we have any reverence for the choices of our ancestors, it seems to me we ought particularly to reverence those that they not only practice but they profess as being the right solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.292" offset="14270872">As far as the entanglement question is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.194" offset="14282470">It seems to me that that is entirely spurious in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.030" offset="14297830">There has been no evidence whatsoever of that entanglement and there is no meaning for it under this kind of -- it is the only statute involved in this case which permits the organization to do, to engage in this type of renting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.479" offset="14367630">As far as policing, the income is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.857" offset="14377138">Again that is a spurious claim because in order for you qualify initially as a church the State has to be entitled, you know, and to review that, has to be entitled to make at least simple external tests of the uses to which the property and income of that organization is put.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.401" offset="14459267">So we cannot have tax exemptions of any kind and we could not have taxation of any kind either if the entanglement doctrine were pushed to the point where the State could not engage in simple external auditing at definite periods of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.570" offset="14539933">The last reason that would really justify and increases the justification for this choice, of the all the States is that if they were to single out churches as of special class of churches would as a practical matter simply restructure their legal entities for a holdings their charitable non-profit activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.631" offset="14652260">In other words if the doctrine were that the Church could not be exempted with respects to this traditional income producing activities of home facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.496" offset="14699698">Then the churches would spin off all their other activities into other types of corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.264" offset="14730732">And this seems to be an absolutely useless time of gesture to force the churches to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.170" offset="14758317">Now if the church, pull itself down to where it is simply conducting a house of worship then Walz is absolute authority for the exemptability from the property tax of the house of worship.</text>

            <text syncTime="3715.863" offset="14937099">Well, I think in conclusion I can sum it up this way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3734.271" offset="15010764">But if any reason, the Court should decide that the questions presented by this case is not moot then the only answer that the Court can give to the question which is simply the constitutional permissibility of parity of treatment with respect to the home facilities is that that parity of treatment is permissible because that is the only answer that is consistent with the State and the Federal Tax history with religious neutrality and with the preservation of legislative discretion.</text>
