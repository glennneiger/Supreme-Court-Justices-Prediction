            <label>Mr. Fredric C. Tausend</label>
            <text syncTime="12.500" offset="123691">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.456" offset="135498">Yesterday afternoon I told you what this case was about.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.070" offset="150023">This morning, I hope to persuade you to exercise your discretion to accept this case as an original action.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.112" offset="178130">The States who are Plaintiffs in the amici seek two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.818" offset="192968">One, a single unified trial of the antitrust for equitable relief only, and two, a speedy resolution of this litigation so that what now appears to be the most adequate equitable remedy namely retrofit of pre 1968 cars at the expense of the defendants can remain a viable possibility for the Court to administer if it sees fit to do so at the conclusion of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.100" offset="314072">Under the standards which this Court lay down in Wyandotte and Georgia, you must been exercising your discretion ascertain first if there was an alternative forum to which this case may be remitted in the interest of convenience, efficiency, and justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.992" offset="373631">Now clearly because this is a Sherman Act, Section 1 case, that forum must be a federal one.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.869" offset="397141">The appellant's alternative forum that comes to mind is the District Court in the Central District of California at Los Angeles, the Multidistrict Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.879" offset="433190">Judge Real has served almost two years as the 1407 transferee judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.979" offset="453565">He is familiar with many of the facts in this litigation in that capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.811" offset="468925">He has presided over extensive pre-trial hearings I believe there have been at least six.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.267" offset="490764">He has attended portions of a two depositions of officers to the defendants that have been taking to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.198" offset="514483">He has read some of the documents which were submitted to him in a brief under seal and he has made it clear by adopting the plaintiff proposed discovery and trial preparation schedule that under his direction these cases could be ready to go to trial in December 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.985" offset="589611">But standing ultimately in the way of that resolution, a single trial in December 1972 on the equitable issues are these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.944" offset="625451">As I pointed that yesterday, 34 of the governmental cases were brought in Districts other than Central District of California, 23 separate districts as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.350" offset="671113">So to achieve a single trial at the District Court Level there would have to be transfers to Los Angeles of all 34 cases under 28 USC Section 1404.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.272" offset="718761">And the defendants have announced time and again that they would resist such to transfers and such a consolidated trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.821" offset="748958">At page 4 of their supplemental brief which is the cream-colored brief, the next to the last brief they filed in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.832" offset="781036">They assert that the joint trial was not feasible, not feasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.010" offset="797755">And at the proceeding before Judge Real in Los Angeles, a week ago Thursday, the defendants indicated just how vigorously they will resist such a transfer on both substantive and procedural grounds if Judge Real attempts to go ahead with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.278" offset="862852">I have submitted the transcripts of those proceedings such an the appendix to our brief and I am going to quote for Mr. Cutler, at page 51 of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.447" offset="903498">I am going a quote a few remarks and if the Court has the transcript and would like to see the entire context of those remarks that Mr. Cutler made, I'll invite your attention to page 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.661" offset="944354">Mr. Cutler told the court and I quote, "I think we would have to say that any decision at this point in favor of transfer and consolidation is something which we would feel bound to seek review."</text>
            <text syncTime="231.620" offset="1000152">And then said Mr. Cutler everything would be help up while that was being resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.725" offset="1032543">Now, Mr. Cutler's thrust has two points. One, very clearly the defendants intend if they can to hold up everything attacking this transfers and the second point is that they will seek with you which means that ultimately this case is going to reach this Court and probably more than once because the defendants have already taken and interlocutory appeal from Judge Real's order denying their motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.712" offset="1140586">The interlocutory appeal Your Honors was certified in November 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.678" offset="1160439">The case was finally argued in the Ninth Circuit on January 1972, it is now subjudicy and certiorari I believe as certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.562" offset="1203907">So I think the defendants have made it clear that they're not going to let this Court escape the burden of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.790" offset="1236821">So the question then is I believe, would the burden imposed by accepting original jurisdiction as we urge this Court to do, especially where the Master can be a Federal District Judge who is totally familiar with the case and was indicated that but for the legal obstacles which the defendants are raising, he would most probably be prepared to go to trial on the equitable claims on December 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.234" offset="1338594">Is that burden really greater than the burden imposed by the persistent, excuse me, by the persistent threat from the defendants on what can only be characterized as protracted in piecemeal litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.996" offset="1397631">And beyond the burden that would be imposed on this Court is the burden which would be imposed on the entire Federal Judicial System if the defendants succeed on delaying the trial to a point where the possibility of equitable relief through retrofit is no longer a viable one because of the delays in time and the cars leaving the road at the rate of 8 to 10 million a year as it accelerates as I explained to the Court yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.796" offset="1504837">Because of that point, at some point on the future money damages would then be the only sensible recourse of the States and the difficulties and complexities of this case will be every bit as great and perhaps greater than the Multidistrict Panel warned up when it assigned these cases to Judge Real.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.272" offset="1590832">Now the defendants also will be greatly burden by multiple jury trials and diverse appeals but apparently they are willing to bear this burden in order to avoid paying in this way for their Sherman Act violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.967" offset="1649556">It is to avoid these burdens on the Court on the Federal Judiciary on the 34 States and New York and to obtain an early end to the litigation and to preserve the possibility of retrofit relief at the defendants expense as a viable remedy for the wrong alleged that we urged this Court now to accept the original jurisdiction of this case, appoint Judge Real as your Master and let us proceed the trial in December 1972, that is my argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="436.595" offset="1820083">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.240" offset="1842653">The defendants urged that this case is governed by your decision at the last term in Wyandotte and that in one important sense it simpler than Wyandotte.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.590" offset="1896047">In Wyandotte, you based your decision on two major grounds the availability of another impartial and no less of appropriate forum even though Ohio had not filed suit in that forum and as a cogent reason, a practical wisdom for declining jurisdiction on the light of your other responsibilities the possibility of imminent legislative and administrative relief for the factually and technically complex environmental problem they are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.131" offset="2038258">In the present case, the Court need not reason on the basis of the hypothetical availability of other no less appropriate forums or on the mere possibility of legislative and administrative relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.954" offset="2113490">In the present cases, the same plaintiffs states and the amici states have already filed essentially the same suits against all the defendants and other more appropriate District Court forums where a pre-trial preparation as Mr. Tausend told you or actively proceeding and more over a comprehensive program on legislative and administrative relief or the even more complex environmental problems here both the Federal and the State level is already an on-going fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.526" offset="2267822">I would like to ask the Court if it would to look at our supplemental memorandum in our position which is the cream-colored memorandum filed on December 23 and if you will turn to the appendix of that memorandum, you will see a compilation of all of these pending District Court cases which have now been consolidated for pre-trial purposes --</text>

            <text syncTime="585.408" offset="2415361">I don't think it's correct to say Mr. Justice Douglas that it is impossible, it is our belief number one that the question of whether these cases should be transferred to a single district for trial and then consolidated for trial is a question that can be best evaluated when the pre-trial proceedings are further along the identity of the witnesses and the nature the issues are better known, the question of whether the cases as they present themselves for the different states are essentially different cases in major aspects such as the quality of the air in the given State the impact of the defendants' activities on the quality of the air in that State and the relationships that have going on between the regulatory authorities and the automobile companies in that State.</text>

          <turn speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="643.983" stopTime="781.512">
            <label>Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler</label>
            <text syncTime="643.983" offset="2649627">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.342" offset="2651090">I am suggesting that is an entirely appropriate question for the District Courts to resolve under the transfer powers and the consolidation powers when the pre-trial proceedings are further along.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.041" offset="2709814">Moreover, if you would look at the appendix, sir, you will see that these plaintiffs, most of them after they filed the single case before you when the time came as Mr. Tausend mentioned when they decided to file District Court complaints to protect against a fairly remote statute of limitations possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.361" offset="2819110">They filed those complaints not in one action as they filed before you which they were perfectly free to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.423" offset="2855368">They filed those complaints as you will see on page 42 of appendix A in some 12 different Federal Districts, eight of them as widely separate as Hawaii and Maine as it happens elected to file a single complaint in the Central District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.828" offset="2929033">But the others for reasons best known to themselves elected to file in separate districts thus creating the transfer problem about which they are now complaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.033" offset="2977830">In fact, they did this after we, in our initial memorandum and opposition to the filing of the complaint here, had said that these courts, original jurisdiction is not necessary if they want to achieve their purpose of the single trial. All they had to do was get together and file a single complaint of the same type in a single District Court which they did not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.914" offset="3085350">Moreover, even though they failed to do it the District Courts among them clearly have the power to transfer these cases under Section 1404 and to consolidate them for trial under Rule 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.890" offset="3145223">Should they conclude, despite the arguments, we may very well make to do contrary after the conclusion of the pre-trial discovery that consolidation and transfer are not in the interest of justice.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="781.512" offset="3199766">Mr. Cutler aren't the differentiating factors which you mentioned in response to Justice Douglas as questioned, primarily wants to do with remedy rather than liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="791.543" offset="3239890">No, they're not Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because liability in a Section 16 action and in a Section 4 action which this plaintiffs have also brought in the District Courts depends first on the proof of an antitrust conspiracy let us say, and second on the impact of that conspiracy on the particular plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.385" offset="3339260">For example, there is an allegation on these complaints that the defendant conspired to delay the installation of one particular retrofit device on vehicles in the State of California for one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.018" offset="3397774">We would intend to show not only that we did not so conspire but that if we had, that particular Act could have had no effect or certainly no tangible impact on the quality of the air or any injury to the State of Hawaii or the State of Maine or any of the other States which were not directly involved in that particular Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.449" offset="3511459">If you will look again at this list of cases at page 42, many of these cases in the District Courts in fact all of those that are brought by States are contained the same allegations that are contained in these cases before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.265" offset="3594738">But in addition to that they are class actions brought on behalf of all the political units in those States and they are also actions for damages and we would submit to you that the District Courts which have those cases before them are far better able to deal with the plaintiffs present request made to the District Court to drop their damage claims and to deal with the question of how the dropping of those claims is to be resolved among the various members of their classes and to how the question of dropping the damage claims in some but not all of the State cases because California has declined to drop its damage claim and has declined to seek this early equity trial how those problems are to be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.901" offset="3821272">First, to make sure that the dismissal of this class action complaints below is properly approved by the Court and second, how any jury trial or right to jury trial issues under Beacon Theaters are to be resolved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1178.538" offset="4787802">You have only taken one original antitrust case so far as I know and that is Georgia against Pennsylvania and that case was taken on the express ground as we understand it that the District Courts where incidentally Georgia had not filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.850" offset="4877141">None of the District Courts reason this Court could have in personam jurisdiction over all of the defendants and that is why you took this as an original jurisdiction case saying in the opinion of the Court though in other respects we assumed it namely District Court jurisdiction would be wholly appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.085" offset="4986019">And here, all of the handicaps of this Court as a trier of fact, since you cannot listen to the taking of evidence in the first instance, cited in the dissents in the Georgia case overwritten in Georgia only for a reason that is not present here would be before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.476" offset="5087583">This is not, as plaintiffs appear to believe, a simple per se antitrust case and the government never contended when it brought its own suit that it was a per se case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.523" offset="5139828">It's a case that involves the complex history of some 20 years of interaction between governmental authorities and the automotive industry as both of them were gradually coming to realize the significant effects of automotive emissions on the general air quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.839" offset="5233033">And the case has a unique quality to it that is going to require extensive proof because of it's the first case to our knowledge that involves the, what economist called the principle of externality, namely the incorporation of a feature in a product such as an automobile which is put their for a social or for public purposes and which the individual purchaser of the vehicle does not perceive as having any utility to himself on his vehicle and will not pay an additional price for if you give him a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.118" offset="5414114">In fact, in the case of an emission control apart from its cost the purchaser may regard it as a positive detriment because of its adverse effects on fuel equality, on idling, on heating up in traffic and on cold starting and we have filed with the Court since the relief of course that these plaintiffs insist on, its retrofit relief, we filed with you yesterday a recent report submitted to the air quality -- Air Resources Board of California by its staff and February 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.543" offset="5583910">It's only six pages long and I urge you to look at it because it analyzes all of the available retrofit kits that have been submitted to the State of California which does have a mandatory retrofit law and which will require all of its citizens to retrofit when and as the State triggers the law by certifying a particular device something after years of that law being on the books the State has not yet done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.106" offset="5742107">Plaintiffs have said to you that the problems that this Court faces with its difficulties as the trier of fact could be resolved by appointing Judge Real as your Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.626" offset="5804174">But this really would not resolve the problems you face as a trier of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.609" offset="5832178">Judge Real sitting as Special Master would -- could only recommend findings of fact to you on which you could would have to make an independent evaluation and he could only recommend to you rulings on issues of law has plaintiffs themselves seem to admit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.601" offset="5924129">He could do far less himself and he would involved you much more in interlocutory and other reviews of what he was doing if he said as your Special Master then that he and other District Judges sat as District Judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.539" offset="5991838">They could dispose issues as District Judges which they could not dispose as Special Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.657" offset="6016289">For example, if there were a plea of the statute limitations answered by a claim of fraudulent concealment or motion to dismiss at the end of the plaintiffs' case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.771" offset="6060801">Judge Real or another District Judge could decide those and the whole case might be over at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.803" offset="6088909">Subject only to appellant review and appellant review which might never reach you, and might be resolved in the Court of Appeals and despite what Mr. Tausend has said it's perfectly possible that if these cases are tried in the District Courts they will ultimately be resolved in ways that never make it necessary for this Court, at least to grant certiorari and review any particular aspect of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.100" offset="6198101">Further, if Judge Real were to function not only as the appointee of the Multidistrict Panel in all of these are the cases but also as your Special Master, he might find a conflict of interest in those two responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.916" offset="6277409">You might say, can a master serve two masters? But he is responsible to the Multidistrict Panel for the expeditious conduct of the pre-trial proceedings in those other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.991" offset="6325683">Supposed we were to say to him at some point that we felt the California case which raises both damage issues still and equitable issues should be tried first because California was the State with which asked the automobile companies in the first instance to appoint a committee and get to work in this area and most of the interaction between the industry and the Government took place initially with the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.104" offset="6446160">And if that case were tried first and we would erase that as the case that should be tried first, the Beacon Theaters problems would be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.304" offset="6478865">How could Judge Real, sitting both as your Special Master in these cases and as the Multidistrict Panel Judge in the other cases, resolve that problem?</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.125" offset="6522228">He would have to take his orders from you which might to proceed with this case which might be essentially incompatible with his other duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.694" offset="6560472">Furthermore, you had an experience with a Special Master in the only original antitrust case you ever took.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.845" offset="6601118">Georgia, if you'll recall, came to you itself for urgent equitable relief, that is all you took and you appointed a highly confident Master.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.521" offset="6655766">Georgia thought probably also it had a simple document case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.614" offset="6672171">One that it put into the Master in one day yet it took this very capable Master, Mr. Lloyd Garrison, four years to hear first the defendants proof of the lack of conspiracy and the essential reasonableness of what they have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.140" offset="6758271">And to prepare his report and the report itself was some 700 odd pages alone, there were more than 15 volumes of testimony and a dozen-volume of exhibits which you would have had to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.115" offset="6810202">You were fortunately spared that which might have taken another year because Georgia itself voluntarily dropped its case as mooted by some pending ICC proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.979" offset="6861611">So we would say to you, Your Honors, that the District Courts left to themselves, we believe and with whatever appropriate appellate review first the Courts of Appeal when which you have always relied in the past in antitrust cases and which you have been very unhappy to see eliminated from the review of direct appeals by defendants in government antitrust cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.732" offset="6976654">You could rely on them to see that the proceedings were going forward expeditiously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.301" offset="6998911">Judge Real, I can assure you sitting as the Multidistrict Panel Judge is applying the lash very vigorously to all us and the defendants in this case far from doing what Mr. Tausend has said have been taking the initiative below in pretrial discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.228" offset="7082607">We filed our first wave discovery requests something like a month before they were required to be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.931" offset="7117402">The plaintiffs have not yet filed this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.429" offset="7127433">We initiated the taking of depositions of some of our older witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.497" offset="7151675">And we have said to Judge Real who incidentally has not yet approved the December trial date and has not yet adopted on any permanent basis the plaintiffs program but wants to see the reaction of these classes in municipalities first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.238" offset="7214682">We have said to him that we are prepared to go forward as to accept any target date for the completion of pretrial and to go forward as rapidly as any case involving 20 years of history in this rather abstruse technology in these relationships with various government agency would permit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2932.220" offset="11802620">But I think you could condition or the Court of Equity could condition the granting of the equitable relief on meeting certain standards and one of the standards would be that the retrofit be put on the car so that the cars can be made clean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.032" offset="11857791">Now, I'd like to mention two things in our context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.810" offset="11872942">One is Mr. Cutler referred to the cost of equitable relief and how this cost would somehow interfere with the efforts of the automobile companies to go ahead and meet the 75 standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.333" offset="11931038">I think that argument simply has no place here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.308" offset="11942950">And I would like to put in perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.617" offset="11952145">The cost of these devices according to these defendants is approximately $20.00 a device.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.462" offset="11975551">We're talking now today about 50 million used cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.175" offset="11994359">Each year, at least 8 million go off the road so we are talking at most about less than a billion dollars in the light of an antitrust conspiracy that lasted 15 years and in the light of net after tax revenues of General Motors alone in 1971 of over $2 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.097" offset="12078055">So I am not saying it's a little amount of money that is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.185" offset="12090385">But it's not the kind of gigantic staggering cost that Mr. Cutler has indicated at the Court would be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.454" offset="12119538">And secondly, it should be pointed out which is exactly what the defendants want to accomplish that as we go on, each year eight million leave $116 million is depleted from the obligation that these defendants could meet if retrofit is the correct and adequate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.363" offset="12199159">And I would like to say that Mr. Cutler did say that when I quoted him, he was talking in 1404 about a pre-mature argument that the -- that it would be premature to transfer at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.170" offset="12250359">But he went further at that at page 53 of the transcript and he said and I assume he still believes it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.809" offset="12272929">There is a major substantive issue as to whether Section 1404 meant that the transferee judge in effect could transfer cases to himself for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.109" offset="12326114">I would like to say who is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.926" offset="12337399">Mr. Cutler has said there are 18 States and California isn't in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.837" offset="12353072">Well, California did sign the amicus brief and which it said if the Court agrees to entertain his complaint amici will seek leave to join as plaintiffs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.491" offset="12395704">Now, they haven't changed that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.670" offset="12408347">California is under just a little bit tighter gun than some of the rest of us and it's because their State is getting very close already.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.255" offset="12446695">They passed the statute in November 1971 requiring retrofit when devices are certified and made mandatory by the Air Resources Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.205" offset="12482535">In February 1972 Report which Mr. Cutler submitted late yesterday to this Court, there is an indication of how that is proceeding devices are just about ready to certification and as we are worried about a trial being postponed long enough so that the equitable relief is no longer viable as cars go off the road, so California is concerned that when the retrofit law goes into effect and when cars start being retrofitted at the expense of California, the equitable remedy may not be adequate now as we point it out in our brief --</text>
