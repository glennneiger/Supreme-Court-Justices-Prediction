            <label>Mr. Erwin Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="32.341" offset="203084">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.335" offset="227013">This is a direct appeal from a decision of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia which has held that an act of Congress, generally applicable throughout the United States is unconstitutional as applied to the offense charged in the criminal indictment before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.364" offset="335159">The offense, to put it simply, is bribery and the defendant against whom the charge is made was a United States Senator at the time charged is now a former United States Senator.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.342" offset="415094">The facts are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.061" offset="433902">There is virtually nothing before the Court except the indictment, found by the grand jury and a motion to dismiss the indictment which was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.023" offset="493775">The indictment contains a number of counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.982" offset="509553">The odd numbered counts relate to the defendant, the alleged bribee.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.638" offset="544244">The even number counts relate to the parties who are charged with having offered or given the bribe, or the briber.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.255" offset="586666">And the underlying facts appear on page 1 of the appendix in the -- as alleged in the indictment, that at all times, Daniel Brewster was a public official of the United States, a member of the Senate of the United States from the State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.199" offset="674438">And then the gist of the charge appears on page 2 of the appendix with respect to count 1 and I repeat, the odd numbered count relates to Senator Brewster and are all essentially the same as far as the issue now before the Court is concerned and the charge is that he corruptly asked, solicited, sought, accepted, received and agreed to receive the sum of $5,000.00 for himself and for an entity, that is the DC Committee from Maryland Education, from Cyrus T Anderson and Spiegel Inc. in return for being influenced in his performance of official acts in respect of his action, vote and decision on postage rate legislation which might at any time be pending before him in his official capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.062" offset="913928">Now, the motion which was filed on behalf of the defendant appears on page 8 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.914" offset="953321">There is also another motion on page 9 which relates to vagueness and things to that sort which was not dealt with in any way by the District Court and an appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act brings to this Court only the issue which was dealt with, excuse me, this is not the Criminal Appeals Act, this is the Act allowing direct appeals in cases where an act to Congress has been held unconstitutional and such an appeal brings here only the issue which was decided below.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.880" offset="1089158">And the motion to dismiss on page 8 of the appendix, the defendant moves to dismiss the odd numbered counts and ground is that counts 1, 3, 5, and 7 of the indictment charged this defendant with violations of 18 U.S.C. 201 (c) (1) and in each such count this defendant is charged with being influenced in his performance of official acts in his capacity as a United States Senator.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.996" offset="1209635">And there is of course not the slightest doubt that that is what the indictment charge is, that he was influenced in his official acts, in his capacity as a United States Senator.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.974" offset="1257595">Now, the question of jurisdiction of this Court was postponed until the hearing on the merits and here I find I have made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.127" offset="1330216">This is an appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.713" offset="1348502">It might possibly have been brought under the other statutes, but it is an appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.336" offset="1375042">The statute involved is the former form of Section 3731 of Title XVIII and known as the Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.408" offset="1419346">The amendment to this provision which was enacted last January is not applicable since the case was began by indictment on December 1, 1969, more than a year before the enactment of the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.986" offset="1481622">The relevant provisions of the Criminal Appeals Act are quoted on page 5 of the appellee’s motion to dismiss or affirm and on page 9 of the appellee’s brief and to refresh the Court’s recollection, I will read the two provisions involved which are at least verbally, relevantly, relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.740" offset="1596665">Appeal lies to this Court under that statute from a decision or judgment setting aside or dismissing any indictment or information on any count thereof where such decision or judgment is based upon the invalidity or construction of the statute upon which the indictment or information is founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.315" offset="1686944">And the other statute relating to appeals on acts that -- decisions holding act of Congress unconstitutional is not applicable because it applies only to civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.263" offset="1730725">And this is a criminal case and the second head of jurisdiction under the old Criminal Appeals Act is from the decision or judgment sustaining a motion in bar when the defendant has not been put in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.167" offset="1798330">And we contend that there is jurisdiction under this case under either or both of those two provisions of the former Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.176" offset="1842425">In the first place, it is entirely clear that the defendant has not been put in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.101" offset="1866039">No jury was empaneled nor was the case in any way submitted to the judge as a trier of the facts with the judge sitting in place of a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.788" offset="1916822">There was simply the indictment and the motion to dismiss, the traditional way to raise a legal question with respect to a criminal indictment and thus the case comes within the language of Justice Harlan in the Sisson case, where in distinguishing this Court’s decision in United States against Covington.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.707" offset="2016505">Justice Harlan noted that the dismissal in Covington was “before trial without any evidentiary hearing” and that is printed in the italics in the report itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.238" offset="2074601">That of course is exactly the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.675" offset="2084423">This was before trial and without any evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.891" offset="2105217">And similarly the situation comes clearly within the language used in the Court’s opinion in the Jorn case last term where it was said that in enacting the Criminal Appeals Act, Congress wished “to avoid subjecting the defendant to a second trial, where the first had terminated in a manner favorable to the defendant either because of a jury verdict or because of judicial action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="537.130" offset="2222245">Here there has never been a first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.539" offset="2235829">There has been a motion to dismiss entirely on the face of the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.488" offset="2255577">There has been a decision on that motion to dismiss, but that is not in the sense of the Criminal Appeals Act or the sense of double jeopardy, a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.631" offset="2296224">In this case there was no stipulation of facts of any sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.767" offset="2316704">There was nothing that could even be regarded as a Bill of Particulars or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.283" offset="2342826">There were no concessions by the Government of any sort, nor any factual assertions by the Government beyond what is stated in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.919" offset="2389324">The entire proceedings before Judge Hart are printed in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.962" offset="2413566">I believe that what I have said with respect to them is fully supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.269" offset="2446794">There is nothing in it to support a contention that Judge Hart made any sort of a factual determination or adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.037" offset="2489844">What he decided is that on the facts alleged in the indictment, the statute cannot be constitutionally applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.762" offset="2524743">And Mr. Ramsey quite properly points to language which was used by Judge Hart in expressing his opinion and this appears on page 33 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.372" offset="2583153">And Judge Hart did say right at the middle of the page, gentlemen, “based on the facts of this case, which sounds bad from my point of view, it is admitted by the Government, which sounds bad from my point of view, that the five counts of the indictment which charged Senator Brewster relate to the acceptance of bribes in connection with performance of a legislative function by a Senator of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="657.582" offset="2704048">But from an examination of the transcript, it is readily apparent that the facts to which Judge Hart was referring were those stated in the indictment not anything that was conceded by the Government or asserted by the Government or offered by way of affidavit, deposition in any other way in terms of facts, above and beyond the effects alleged in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.009" offset="2813762">And it is also clear that nothing was admitted in a factual sense by counsel, by -- for the Government, before Judge Hart.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.586" offset="2852005">Insofar as counsel admitted anything there, it was that the facts charged in the indictment are those which are -- they are alleged, namely that the defendant was at all relevant times a United States Senator and that he is charged with seeking and receiving a bribe under the circumstances stated in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.594" offset="2968093">Thus there is clearly a case in which the Court below has held that an act of Congress is unconstitutional as applied to the facts alleged in this indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.987" offset="3021592">This seems to come squarely within this Court’s decision in the Knox case in 396 U.S.which upheld the jurisdiction of this Court under the Criminal Appeals Act, where the statute has been held unconstitutional as applied to the facts alleged in the indictment, although not generally unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.633" offset="3124201">It is also our view that there is jurisdiction under the other clause of Section 3731, the one relating to a motion in bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.106" offset="3174147">We contend that the assertion made in the motion to dismiss in this case, namely that, this defendant is charged with being influenced in his performance of official acts in his capacity as a United Sated Senator and that the indictment for this reason violates the provision of Article 1, Section 6 of the United States constitution is a motion in bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.467" offset="3283548">Sometimes a motion in bar is referred to as a confession in avoidance and Mr. Ramsey says that the defendant has not confessed.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.170" offset="3330359">I think though that the problem comes from too broader use of the word confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.785" offset="3356795">When a person raises the statute on limitations or a pardon, this is clearly within the motion in bar provision, yet in such a case the defendant need not to confess.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.027" offset="3417817">He says in the effect, whether I did it or not or even if I did do it, you cannot prosecute me because of the statute of limitations or the pardon as the case may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.297" offset="3478839">And this is exactly what Senator Brewster’s counsel have said here, whether I did it or not or even if I did do it, you cannot prosecute me because of the speech or debate clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.605" offset="3540070">This seems to me to be what is meant by motion in bar as used in this statute or by the term special plea in bar, which was used in its original form.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.059" offset="3605899">It is for example the kind of motion that would have been made by a member of the House of Commons in the 18th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.074" offset="3637977">If there were a charge against him which he cannot allege, he came within parliamentary privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.945" offset="3669429">What the defendant is saying is that even if I admitted all of the facts, I have a special defense that I suggest is a motion in bar and brings this case within the jurisdictional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.853" offset="3741109">Now, let me turn to the merits of the case which is of course a natural sequel to the Court’s decision in the Johnson case in 383 U.S. decided little over five years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.064" offset="3813938">Understandably enough, the appellee relies on the Johnson decision and it is incumbent on me to show that the facts there make that case distinguishable from those which are alleged in this indictment and I repeat we have nothing here except the facts alleged in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.999" offset="3909651">It is perfectly possible, it seems to me for this trial to be conducted under this indictment in a way which might infringe the Johnson case and if that were done, there would be another issue, but that is not the problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.747" offset="3968688">The problem here is whether the trial can be conducted in such a way as not to infringe the Johnson case and I submit that it can.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="991.771" offset="4040786">Full transcript of the evidence and reversal by the Court of Appeals and that reversal was upheld by this Court and indeed with the benefit of hindsight, it seems apparent that the Johnson case was an unfortunate one to bring here from the Government’s point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.274" offset="4130751">In the first, the charge there, the issue there related to a charge under the conspiracy statute which is I suppose the most general of all criminal statutes, the one most subject to undue extension by a wide ranging prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.439" offset="4215388">In the second place, the prosecution of Congressman Johnson largely turned on a speech which he made on the floor of Congress, that is the prosecution with respect to this, there was also another count of a conflict of interest which related to his appearances in the Department of Justice, but the conspiracy charge related to a speech he had made in the floor of Congress relating to building and loan associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.334" offset="4314967">Although the record was a long one and had many things in it, 50 pages of the transcript related to the speech in the case presented by the Government and there was much more about the speech in the presentation of the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.750" offset="4384662">The Government indeed introduced a copy of the speech in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.735" offset="4404619">The conspiracy charge was that the speech was not made for any legislative purpose, but was made by Congressman Johnson for fee in order to that might reprinted and distributed to prospective depositors so as to encourage them to make deposits in Maryland’s Savings and Loan associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.932" offset="4493435">It is also relevant I think that the indictment contained a substantial allegation about the speech and this was reproduced in this Court’s opinion at page 184, at paragraph 15, I read from the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.036" offset="4569817">It was a part of said conspiracy that it said, Thomas F. Johnson should render services for compensation to with the making of a speech, defending the operations of Maryland’s independent savings and loan associations, the financial stability insolvency thereof and the reliability and integrity of the commercial insurance on investments made by said independent savings and loan associations on the floor of the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.332" offset="4679009">Thus, that was a central part of the actual charge in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.525" offset="4715790">It should be observed too that the Court’s opinion is narrowly guarded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.624" offset="4744211">On page 184 of the opinion, Justice Harlan said near the top of the page, whatever room the constitution may allow for such factors in the context of a different kind of prosecution and here we clearly have a different kind of prosecution and then on page 185, Justice Harlan said we emphasize that our holding is limited to prosecutions involving circumstances such as those presented in the case before us which involved extensive utilization of the central factor in the prosecution of the making of a speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.943" offset="4913484">And the Court said we expressly leave open for consideration when the cases arises, a prosecution which though possibly entailing inquiring into legislative acts or motivations is founded on a narrowly drawn statute passed by Congress in the exercise of its legislative part to regulate the conduct of its members.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.946" offset="6661494">I think of course that a Congressman or Senator should be protected against suit for libel, from things said in committee hearing, but the constitutional provision is for any speech or debate in either House.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.424" offset="6759401">I repeat I think that some of the language in some of the cases has been very broad and that there are no decisions on such matters even with respect to what is said in committee hearing, but it is not -- there is nothing about a committee hearing in this case, it is not necessary to decide that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.955" offset="6837455">I would like in the brief time remaining to refer to the legislative history of this statute because as it is now stands it is in some what broad language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.166" offset="6906314">This is the statute which is quoted on pages 2 and 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.761" offset="6936720">It refers to public official who does these things and then public official is defined to include member of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.989" offset="6977680">This is not brought out in our brief and I would like an opportunity very briefly to present it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.331" offset="7007042">The history of the statutory provision is that in 1853, Congress enacted a statute which was specifically applicable to members of Congress who take bribes and to take bribes with intent to influence his vote or decision on any question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.559" offset="7103904">From on 1853 on, Congress has specifically provided that it was a crime for a Congressman or the Senator to take a bribe intended to influence his vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.051" offset="7153850">That was continued in the revised statutes of 1874 and 1878.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.994" offset="7181644">It was continued in the criminal code of 1908 and it was in effect in 1962, when Congress passed the present statute, but it is entirely clear that in enacting the present statute the motivation to consolidate a lot of separate bribery provisions dealing with public officials generally came from Congress, not from the Executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.997" offset="7305674">There was a report by a staff of subcommittee number 5 of the committee on judiciary of the House of Representatives in 1958, which recommended the consolidation of these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.355" offset="7371084">At page 71 of that report it is recommended that the provisions prohibiting the bribery of federal employees, members of Congress and judges and judicial officers including jurors be combined in a single statute and then that is carried forward in the committee reports, senate report of number 2213 in the 87th Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.262" offset="7498771">The current bribery laws consist of separate sections applicable to various categories or persons, Government employees, members of Congress, judges and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.062" offset="7541925">Section 201 would bring all these categories within the purview of one section and make uniform the prescribed act of bribery as well as the intent or purpose involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.804" offset="7592916">And there is a similar provision in the House Committee report which is House report number 748 in the 87th Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.018" offset="7653729">Now, whether at that time as you may recall a considerable development of thought about conflict of interest, a Bill with respect to conflict and interest came before Congress and it was at the initiative of the Senate Judiciary, of the House Judiciary committee that these provisions with respect to bribery or consolidated and introduced in the same Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.481" offset="7751636">And I think it is perfectly fair to say that this statute should be construed in the light of its clear and long continued history as one which in part at least is focused by a Congress on the actions of Congressmen and Senators and amounts to a clear declaration by Congress that this sort of conduct should be tried in the Courts with the procedural safeguards and provisions which are applicable to criminal prosecutions before the judiciary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2051.947" offset="8281504">I made the statement at the foot of page 12 and at the top of page 13.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.864" offset="8297177">Now, in this regard the papers which have been filed in the case and the data which had been supplied as respects to the claims made against the defendant Brewster make it perfectly clear that what is being attacked by this indictment are Senator Brewster’s votes in Committee and his votes on the floor and his activities in connection with what the Supreme Court has described as things generally done in a session of the House by its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.821" offset="8400936">The Assistant United States Attorney who was arguing the case came back to this point at page 28 of the appendix, in colloquy again with Judge Hart.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.777" offset="8444822">Judge Hart and I am spiking into the middle of a Court’s question at about midway down, page 28 of the appendix, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.500" offset="8475646">“Well, tell me this? Does the indictment in any ways allege that Brewster did anything not related to his purely legislative functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.595" offset="8516084">Mr. Barret: We are not contending that what is being charged here, that is the activity by Brewster, was anything other than a legislative act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.742" offset="8556626">We are not ducking the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.424" offset="8563417">It is squarely presented.</text>

            <text syncTime="2129.822" offset="8592988">Now this is against the background if the Court please of there having been supplied on a confidential basis to the Court, a memorandum or fact which replaced a statement in connection with a motion for particulars which outlines the very acts which were addressed to the particular counts and what the assistant was telling Judge Hart was, Your Honor, we do not contend their were any activities, not legislative in nature and that is fully supportive in the record, in this case.</text>

Certainly the 1853 statute was designed to cover situations such as the case, U.S. against Burton, such as the case of U.S. versus Johnson, where the whole thrust forward of the case was on the basis that Johnson had been bought, he was bribed -- he was a bribed Congressman.</text>

            <text syncTime="3645.019" offset="14653710">And it is there, again, coming back Mr. Chief Justice to the question which you put to me sir, it is there that we come back to say that is within the ambit of the House of which he is a member, it is without the ambit of the judiciary and the executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.524" offset="14715777">And looking at the 1853 Act and looking at the 1962 revision of it, we most respectfully urge that in each of those instances, this can be given constitutional validity in its broad range to protect against bribery, but that the executive and judiciary should withhold their hands where they intrude in to what might be called the basic defensive mechanism given by the constitution to the members of the Congress of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="4111.252" offset="16518644">Therefore, to me speech or debate, the crux of its historical antecedent has even greater application in the criminal field because that was one of the major things which the framers were attempting to protect the legislator against was intimidation by threat of grand jury, by threat of even a baseless indictment which been read a political being.</text>

            <text syncTime="4405.643" offset="17696244">There is not any doubt that either House has the power to subject to penalty or to expel a member who does anything which the House thinks warrants that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.667" offset="17740338">There is a further problem which is been referred to in the cases which is as far as the House of Representatives is concerned, imprisonment can extend only until the termination of that session of the House and that if the bribery was not found until in the old days that is 2nd of March, you have to hold the trial and he would be release on the 04th of March whenever the Congress expires.</text>

            <text syncTime="4535.282" offset="18214826">It would be our position that the executive could go ahead under this statute and I repeat our position is that unless the Court is prepared to hold, that Congress has no constitutional power to make it a crime for a congressman or senator to accept a bribe for a legislative conduct, this judgment should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4555.894" offset="18297269">Let me refer to the fact that the statute in this case as it now stands makes no reference whatever to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4562.385" offset="18323182">It simply says, if before him in his official capacity and though I do not need to go so far, I think that a conviction could be sustained under this indictment without any showing as to how a senator Brewster voted on any matter or indeed without any evidence that he voted at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4583.150" offset="18406252">Finally, I would call attention to the fact that there was a concurring opinion in the Johnson case by Chief Justice Warren and in which justices Brennan and Douglas concurred, which proceeded on the narrow ground of the extensive use of the speech in that case, thus there is nothing there decided beyond that by anything except a four to three decision and our position is that the problem of this case was not only expressly left open, but a considerable intimation that the Court did not think that it should go as far in construing this rather simple language of the speech and debate clause as to make it impossible for Congress by statute to make it a crime for a congressman or senator to accept the bribe.</text>
