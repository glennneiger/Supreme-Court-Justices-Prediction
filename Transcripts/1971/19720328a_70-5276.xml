            <text syncTime="41.318" offset="238947">Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.286" offset="246889">The petitioner will reserve 10 minutes for rebuttal if we may.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.232" offset="262667">Your Honor, 0047 era was committed in the court below when the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Maryland's Defective Delinquency Law in its Patuxent Institution in meaning and application.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.061" offset="309896">If I may, I would first invite Your Honor’s attention to Page 7 A of our brief in the rear, which sets forth the definition of a defective delinquent.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.051" offset="349916">As can be observed, a defective delinquent or one who is claimed to be a defective delinquent requires a new finding of fact in our State Courts of four critical elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.332" offset="395055">Firstly, that the individual has persistent aggravated anti-social or criminal behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.614" offset="416162">Secondly, that he has a propensity towards this criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.177" offset="434448">Thirdly, that he is found to have intellectual deficiency or emotional imbalance.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.780" offset="452838">And fourthly, that he demonstrates and actual danger to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.205" offset="470497">This particular definition Your Honors is triggered by the provisions of Paragraph 6-D of the Act which are on the very next page.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.961" offset="505501">A request for an examination of a supposed defective delinquent is initiated with a request from almost any persons wherein it would state the individual suspects or supposes that the individual might have defective delinquency.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.985" offset="581674">Now, we suggest firstly in our first position that the legislative food for thought of supposition or suspected that someone has a particular condition would give one constitutional indigestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.673" offset="636427">We bring that to the courts attention for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.923" offset="649383">First of all, the Lower Court has relied in our – nor the Attorney General has relied on this courts earlier decision in Minnesota EX REL Pearson v. Probate Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.638" offset="700270">We think that that reliance is roughly misplaced for these three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.538" offset="719809">Number one, the Minnesota statute which was reported to this court and the court only considered the matter on the basis of so to speak a demur at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.620" offset="752201">There was no procedural hearing such as we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.771" offset="768815">The statute in Minnesota Your Honor has required three things before you could indicate or begin this sexual psychopath statute as what they call it in Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.710" offset="808521">Number one, that the facts must first be submitted to the County Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.072" offset="825971">Secondly, that he must make a finding of good cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.918" offset="841331">And thirdly, that he then prepares a petition to be executed by a person having knowledge of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.717" offset="868603">Now, Your Honors, on the basis of that construed and limited by the Minnesota Court held at Minnesota EX REL Pearson v. Probate Court was constitutional and we set that next to the Maryland Defective Delinquency Act which merely says that a request for examination maybe filed by anyone who suspects or supposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.546" offset="947911">In this regard, it is enlightening to examine very briefly the Attorney General of California has seen fit to file a brief amicus curiae and we noted with interest in the back of his brief in the appendix section where he referred to the particular California Law and that law says, “If it appears to the Court—”</text>

            <text syncTime="260.238" offset="1114676">Secondly of note to turn the page to page two of the brief of the Attorney General of California, you will find that the California statute requires a finding that the person could benefit from treatment, that the person could benefit from treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="853.788" offset="3488893">Yes sir, for example, to follow your point through sir in the original case which brought this matter to the attention of the courts, we had a young man who received an 18 months sentence and was there for seven years.</text>

            <text syncTime="871.529" offset="3559842">All right sir, that’s where we are coming to at the examination stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.022" offset="3573739">As we have indicated to you, the individual goes to Patuxent having been triggered by a criminal situation although its not criminal misbehavior that is the entrance requirement to be in alumni of Patuxent Institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.827" offset="3629014">He can have aggravated antisocial behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.896" offset="3649285">Then when he gets to Patuxent Institute, three things occur which we find somewhat difficult to reconcile with constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.491" offset="3679692">Number one, during the period of time that he is in Patuxent and being examined, he is not allowed to have a benefit of counsel or benefit of his own physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.990" offset="3717622">Number two, if he relies upon the Fifth Amendment as we have indicated, the Court of Appeals of Maryland in a case called 1517at 183 1519 second 368 has said that this is evidence of a hostile nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.805" offset="3772897">And they determined that because of his hostility in citing the Fifth Amendment that this would be ground for finding him a defective delinquent.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.923" offset="3805393">Thirdly, under the 1533 we have already brought into your attention, if an individual in fact takes advantage if the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, then he stays there until he does decide to talk.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.368" offset="3855130">So the examination stage then goes to where the prisoner if called in and is given a battery of psychological and psychiatric test, he is confronted with information that the state has as to his past.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.469" offset="3911555">Unfortunately, he is not given an opportunity to refute the information that the State has against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.633" offset="3940185">For example, the very learned and distinguished Director of Patuxent in the Maryland cases and its found at Page 623 of the Maryland Appendix JAMD 623 stated that the individual can challenge only what we bring up.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.384" offset="3999222">So here, you have an individual sir who is twice cursed.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.263" offset="4010716">He’s a criminal and he’s trying to pay his debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.187" offset="4022418">Secondly, he is now accused of one of two things either being a dummy in a sense being intellectually deficient or emotionally unbalanced, mentally unwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.079" offset="4062020">He’s here before this doctors, he has no counsel, no doctor, no notice, no hearing, no right of appeal, no nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.766" offset="4092740">And then they say to him, “Here’s what you did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.673" offset="4104338">we have all this background information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.748" offset="4112698">Now, you can comment on A, B and C.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.095" offset="4122102">He gets no opportunity sir to refute what the institution has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.558" offset="4139969">And this becomes painfully critical sir for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.002" offset="4173720">You will find in the case that brought this whole matter of called Director v. Daniels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.107" offset="4198170">In the first trial of this young man, we turn back in 1964, JA4 at Page 403.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.173" offset="4230353">The institution submitted a report to the court and their procedure at the Patuxent procedure is that just a report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.555" offset="4263894">It goes to the court and the report is read and this is the States case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1139.237" offset="4630653">When we have to redetermination hearing allowed by the Court of Appeals of Maryland, we were able to summon the mother in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.599" offset="4652074">And this is the testimony at JAMD 61 where the mother said this didn’t happen.</text>

            <text syncTime="1162.650" offset="4724276">So, you have the situation sir where you have a new finding of fact has to be made in four respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.832" offset="4753011">A new finding of fact in four respects by a trial court, a court which has before it a statute which is broad enough to ensnare anyone and then you have trial procedures which allow the most blatant form of hearsay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.613" offset="4816123">The Patuxent report, which is just read to the jury and then now, it is up to the defendant to overcome it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.717" offset="4840573">The man who is in custody having the least opportunity then must face this rambling sea of four or five pages of information that the Patuxent Institution has gotten on him and he has not had the opportunity to refute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.794" offset="4892923">He can only refute that which was brought up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.833" offset="4905044">Lastly, we’d like to save this few minutes but we would want to bring to your attention the fact that under the Maryland Law, we think this is critical sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.198" offset="4934510">That under the Maryland Law, there is no requirement that treatment be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.850" offset="4953109">We think the very basis for such a law such as this is so called indeterminant confinement to get the socially undesirable off the street should have a requirement that the individual be given treatment of some sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="1234.745" offset="5012668">But our Court of Appeals in its wisdom in several cases but the main one Shields v. Director which we have cited in our brief states on an appeal that the inmate made that he was not given any treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.185" offset="5066480">The appellates fourth contention is without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.956" offset="5077556">Since there is no requirement that an inmate be given treatment unless the sane is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.747" offset="5100649">One of the petitioners in this case sir who was there for 13 years because he stuttered, they didn’t have a stuttering teacher or speech teacher for 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.370" offset="5147147">This is what the Court of Appeals said on his appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.091" offset="5158013">It said Page 15 of our reply brief, “As to the stuttering, there is no claim and no showing that it could be helped procured by treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2029.867" offset="8193129">However, recommendation in nearly every instance will have to be based impartibly on antecedent behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.648" offset="8220296">Then it goes on to say, “When Maryland has an institution of the proposed type, many of the most serious crimes can be prevented.</text>

            <label>Mr. Francis B. Burch</label>
            <text syncTime="2213.966" offset="8929573">That’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.275" offset="8934797">At the hearing on whether or not he’s a defective delinquent, the standard is 3658 of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.186" offset="8954441">And the findings of this courts below is a joint record from the Court of Appeals and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals overwhelmingly support the fact that this proceeding is civil in nature and a subsequent completely unrelated to a criminal conviction in the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.423" offset="9027375">Now, Your Honors, may I take the position that labels are not that important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.352" offset="9051094">That’s what the 3725 case said and we agree entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.022" offset="9069798">In fact, the Fourth Circuit made a statement that labels are not particularly helpful and it’s a futile exercise in semantics to argue criminal versus civil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.638" offset="9100205">The point is that the Court of Appeals of Maryland and the Fourth Circuit have both held that this is civil ion nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.204" offset="9126536">Now, certainly, there are safeguards that have to be provided in the law and the point of the State urges today is that these safeguards do exist sufficiently to protect the interest of the petitioners here and also the interest of the State of Maryland in rehabilitating the [Voice overlap].</text>

            <text syncTime="2289.602" offset="9232071">That in fact of course is the reverse side of the coin, that is an additional right in the civil area that does not exist in the criminal area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.426" offset="9267388">And this is provided for if Your Honor will consider the statute, this discovery rights in the defective delinquent statute are provided for explicit, the right to interrogatories and depositions, the full right to access to the file and summons witnesses and cross examine witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.493" offset="9335620">And while I’m on this point of civil versus criminal, I would like to elude to a statement that was made in the conquering opinion by Mr. Justice Harland in the 3845 case because it really is this point I think that many of this questions that are before the court today can be decided upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.687" offset="9416495">Mr. Justice Harland said there is nor automatic congruent between the procedural requirements imposed by due process and criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.499" offset="9455679">And those imposed by a due process in juvenile cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.200" offset="9470516">It is of great importance in my view that procedural strictures not be constitutionally imposed to jeopardize the essential elements of the States purpose in creating juvenile courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.596" offset="9520045">Now, if you substitute for juvenile court in that statement, this whole business of the treatment of defective delinquency recognized or identified with group of people in society, that is the State’s position in essence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.635" offset="9580231">You can call it civil or you can call it criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.555" offset="9591933">But you must recognize that the States has a legitimate interest in carrying out its programs as Mr. Justice Harland recognized in his concurrence and that there maybe certain constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.802" offset="9644910">And Mr. Justice Marshall has eluded to one or two of them that simply from a standpoint of medical treatment cannot be imposed on the State of Maryland in an institution of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.009" offset="9701752">This is an institution which treats patients that are committed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.694" offset="9728502">The population of the whole prison system of Maryland is over 5000 people and there are less than 500 at Patuxent to small single cell institution where people are sent for psychiatric examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.077" offset="9782000">I think the Fourth Circuit made the point more quotiently than I can do it in my own language when it said that it is difficult to imagine anything more stultifying to a psychiatrist as dependent as he is upon the cooperation of his patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.873" offset="9849187">And the presence of a lawyer objecting to the psychiatrist questions and advising his client not to answer this question in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.889" offset="9881266">The injection of broad legal restraints into the diagnostic and treatment procedures that will deny Patuxent’s substantial prospect for improvement over our earlier practices might well restrain most other experimentation looking toward conversion of our correctional institutions into effective rehabilitating agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.223" offset="9958588">Now I urge that this court take exactly the same position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.531" offset="9971858">When the court – the DC circuit in a case called Torton 4117 several years ago indicated that perhaps there should be a right to counsel at the psychiatric examination stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.356" offset="10019088">As far as I know, no other circuit has adopted and there was a vigorous descent in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.775" offset="10040822">Here, we have a case on a full record where the Court of Appeals of Maryland and the Fourth Circuit including all of its members in the separate opinion of Mr. Justice – I mean, Senior Judge 4144 came to conclusion that it would be 4147 disruptive and that there is no constitutional right to counsel at a psychiatric examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.963" offset="10133504">Now, a point that I want to make here because statistics of this sort have only recently been available since Patuxent’s only been open since 1955 is that this concept that was quoted earlier from the researcher port is to what Patuxent was trying to do with this category of people actually works.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.926" offset="10221380">The statistics have demonstrated it and I address Your Honor to the appendix of the appellates brief and the article from the American Journalist Psychiatry of September 1971, which is reprinted therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.981" offset="10285641">Page 126 I believe of the blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.942" offset="10297449">Dr. Emory Hodges, a psychiatrist from Washington on his own conducted an evaluation because the proposed statute of this type has been discussed in the State of Commonwealth of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.463" offset="10343529">And he evaluated the Patuxent experience based on its first 11 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.742" offset="10376652">He found that the National Right of Recidivism for people convicted of crime had been that they would commit their next offense within three years of the time of their release.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.163" offset="10446347">And that 65% to 70% of people so released would commit their next crime within three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.947" offset="10473514">The record at Patuxent is that those released on parole from Patuxent by the Institutional Board of Review is exactly half, 37% rate of recidivism.</text>

            <text syncTime="2679.992" offset="10793671">There was an 81% rate of recidivism.</text>
