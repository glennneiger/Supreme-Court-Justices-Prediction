            <label>Mr. David A. Scholl</label>
            <text syncTime="50.954" offset="277466">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.676" offset="292408">This is a case instituted by 38 named plaintiffs on behalf of a class of all persons in Pennsylvania who would sign contracts containing confession-of-judgment clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.563" offset="339951">I will refer to the appellants in discussing this case as the consumers since they are all consumers and the appellees as the creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.601" offset="376104">I would also like permission to request that five minutes of my time be reserved for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.298" offset="410900">The Pennsylvania State -- we have a Law in Pennsylvania that permitted and in fact, did in the case of these 38 named consumers, the prothonotary who is merely a Court Clerk to ministerially enter judgments against the consumers without their having had any notice nor opportunity to be heard prior to the entry of that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.048" offset="501806">Now, the reason that, the only thing that authorized the prothonotary to do this other than the State Law was a clause which was contained in the contracts that each of the consumer signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.195" offset="550393">This clause, of course is the Confession-of-Judgment Clause and I think that there are two significant characteristics of the Confession-of-Judgment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.997" offset="589682">First, it is one of the many clauses that it is very in prime fine print in contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.894" offset="617267">It is a difficult clause to understand, many attorneys do not understand what the effect of the clause is.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.789" offset="640777">And I think a second important aspect, is that Confession-of-judgment Clauses are contained in almost every contract in Pennsylvania and which credits is extended in any form.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.420" offset="683304">That is to say, loan contracts, retail installment sale contracts, in leases, there is a confession-of-judgment and ejectment, and of course also in mortgage contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="215.295" offset="934811">Now, the confession-of-judgment that the prothonotary may enter, may be entered immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.182" offset="958426">After the contract is signed, that is it can be entered even before there is any allegation of fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.502" offset="983713">It can be entered the same day that the contract is executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.216" offset="998550">It cannot immediately serve as the basis for execution and sale of the consumers’ property.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.217" offset="1022478">However, all that, the creditor need to do it at that point to execute and sale the consumers property is to file ex parte in averment that the consumer has defaulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.105" offset="1074096">Now, what notice does the consumer get to the proceedings that are occurring against him?</text>
            <text syncTime="256.305" offset="1098860">Well, after the judgment is entered, he is required to get notice of the entry of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.435" offset="1127386">However, the property of the consumer can be sold as short as 20 days after the notice of the entry of judgment is given.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.719" offset="1160509">Also, if there is a sale of the consumer’s real estate, he is given notice that the writ of execution has been issued against this real estate and also he is given notice of the sale of his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.393" offset="1207216">However, this is generally by publication although, there must also be notice by mail and that notice by mail may be as little as 10 days before the property is sold.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="294.856" offset="1253087">In the earlier case, I asked counsel that if he thought it would satisfy due process, creditor by informal notice by communicating actual notice, advised to tell him that he intended to exercise the powers granted under the confession-of-judgment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.131" offset="1346188">Do you agree that would satisfy due process?</text>

            <text syncTime="320.574" offset="1355905">Well, I think if it would be noticed that the consumer would have an opportunity at a hearing to raise any defenses that he might have before execution in sale could proceed on the confessed judgment, then I think that it would comport with due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.907" offset="1417241">Of course, that is not what is assured by the Pennsylvania confession-of-judgment statutes and rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.692" offset="1472411">That is right, there is really only one procedure by which the consumer can possibly stop the sale of his property and that is by petitioning to open or to strike the judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="815.947" offset="3337450">And the third exception at the Court made, the Court said that well, if at a prior hearing and well it did not set down, how the procedure would be carried out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.082" offset="4130005">And in fact, there was much evidence that this is exactly what was happening in Philadelphia County prior to the time that Mr. Justice Brennan issued a stay order which stopped all executions and sales on confessed judgments in Philadelphia County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.417" offset="4191340">The $10,000.00 and over exception has also been circumvented by simply requiring that a borrower filed an affidavit, at the time that he take out a loan or whatever harbor he is retaining credit that he earns $10,000.00 and over a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.804" offset="4260826">And it is not surprising that the creditor should have the leverage to get the mortgage or to get the affidavit from the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.798" offset="4292800">Because of course, before he was able to get the confession-of-judgment clause, why not just ask the consumer to sign one more paper which in fact, has the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.207" offset="4334491">I think there is also a problem with the other exception that the Court set out, the voluntary knowing and intelligent waiver hearing which is to be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.690" offset="4372421">The Court below sets no procedure on how this is to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.940" offset="4393424">The way they usually were scheduled in Philadelphia County after the decision was by petition and rule to show cause upon the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.536" offset="4423830">Of course, the consumer gets this petition that says, he has to come in and show that he did not knowingly, voluntarily, intelligently waive his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.781" offset="4456744">This does not apprise him of actually what the significance of that hearing is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.649" offset="4476284">The consumers never apprised that if it is shown in fact, that he knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his rights that he is not going to have any hearing on the merits of any defenses that he might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.297" offset="4522887">Also, the Court below focuses in its discussion although, it says knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently on an understanding waiver by the creditor at the time that the contract is signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.187" offset="4570429">Therefore, we have the anomalous result of somebody who understands the confession-of-judgment clause and perhaps went to a lawyer and asked the lawyer to explain the contract that he is signing before he signed it, he is now accepted from the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.140" offset="4622256">Because he knows or he understood what confession-of-judgment was at the time that he signed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.721" offset="4644513">The person who does not know what it is or perhaps is not prudent enough to go to a lawyer, he does not understandingly waive his rights therefore he is protected by the Court’s decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.070" offset="5693904">I do not think, for instance, that we would urge that any judgments that have been entered by expunge or we would not urge that, in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.231" offset="5730580">I think that what we would urge is that there be, that there be no more execution in sales on even the judgments that have been entered in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.499" offset="5767673">That in the future, there be no more entrance of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.466" offset="5783556">Now, the Land Title Association brief of course raises the issue of retroactivity and I would like to comment on what they say and I think that we actually concur with the Land Title Association’s position which is that any decision on entry should not in any sense be retroactive and that regarding executions in sales that a decision on that be retroactive only since January 26, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.917" offset="5897345">The reason that I choose that date, it is a date that the Land Title Associations indicate that they advise all of their members that they should be careful in the future about insuring titles on confessed judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.537" offset="5951784">And I think that was a point at which the hardship factor that may weigh against a fully retroactive decision, sort of changes over and that it is not at that point so important because at that point the Land Title Associations were unnoticed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.811" offset="6012911">That in fact, confession-of-judgment probably or possibly was constitutionally deficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.242" offset="6086576">I think that perhaps the case before this has highlighted several of actually, the distinctions here. What we are concerned with in this case is a clause that is contained in almost every contract in Pennsylvania and the parties that are negotiating here are not two corporations, they are in fact, the consumer who probably would not even know what confession-of-judgment was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.808" offset="6184901">Much less would be effective it is in a company which uses a standard form and understands of course, perfectly what confession-of-judgment means.</text>

            <text syncTime="1899.001" offset="7669701">It seems that where they got it was from one piece of evidence that we introduced a study taken by Dr. David Caplovitz of the Columbia University Bureau of Applied Social Research in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.448" offset="7719438">David Caplovitz had studied the attitudes of persons who he termed default debtors, in a study taken in several cities, one of which was Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.382" offset="7759144">And one of the findings that Dr. Caplovitz made was a demography of the persons that he had studied and he found that only 4% of these persons earned over $10,000.00 annually.</text>

            <text syncTime="1952.989" offset="7885577">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.913" offset="7913267">I represent the Middle Atlantic Finance Association and 15 members of companies, who were the intervening defendants in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.641" offset="7960183">And in view of shortness of my time because Mr. Matz here will take 10 minutes after me, I will not ask for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.645" offset="7996232">Now, the first question that I would like to cover is the question of whether or not a deferred hearing following judgment violates Due Process when every opportunity is given to the defendant to present every defense he has and the main contentions that are presented by the plaintiffs in that regard are not that there is anything inherently wrongful with having a deferred hearing of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.819" offset="8132904">But they are contending that it is permissible only when there are some overriding governmental interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.438" offset="8163415">And I would merely like to point out that the cases decided by this Court on that subject, rebut that argument because for example that the Coffin case which is cited in our briefs, which was a suit by the liquidator of an insolvent bank against its stockholders is certainly not a suit on behalf of the government, it is just an ordinary lawsuit between a bank and stockholders, and that case specifically held that even though execution was an assessment, which is like a judgment and also an execution were issued before any hearing has been held and even though a lien was acquired upon the stockholders stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.754" offset="8376679">Nevertheless, because the stockholder had a procedural opportunity under the Georgia procedure to present all defenses, because he get on the hearing before he was actually deprived of that property that that complied with Due Process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.605" offset="8440104">There are many other cases to that affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.804" offset="8448882">For example, there is one case not cited in the briefs, Bank of Colombia versus Oakley decided in 1890 and 17 United States 233.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.165" offset="8490364">Now, that case held likewise and there also there was a lien and I will not burden Your Honors with the description either accept the state that there was a statute that provided that anytime a note was payable at the bank, the bank could go ahead and issue execution and acquire a lien and but then there would still be a right to a hearing afterwards.</text>

            <text syncTime="3345.806" offset="13456869">I should like to point out -- the difference between a mortgage bond transaction and a financing transaction for a small loan company, for one, the mortgage bond transaction arises out of the purchase of a home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.277" offset="13514756">Secondly, it has been established below that in almost every case where a home was purchase, the purchaser was represented by either an attorney or by a license realtor, so, the purchaser did have representation at the time of closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.639" offset="13576196">Thirdly, at the time of closing the purchaser receives a statement on the regulations, under the Truth in Lending Act, which clearly indicates to the purchaser at that time that he is executed a document which has within it a confession of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.623" offset="13632202">Fourthly, the mortgage, the lending institutions that we represent have nothing to do with the sale of real estate or any other product, they only have one purpose to lend money for the purchase of homes and therefore, they are not involved in questions of breach of warranty or anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.757" offset="13692702">They only lend money to members of the association for the purpose of buying a home.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.057" offset="13733871">Now, with reference to the actual foreclosure procedures, which I think was talked about before, when a foreclosure proceeding is begun on real estate, the bond is entered a record that is not really a new lien, because that bond is part of the same transaction for which a mortgage was executed and which is already a lien on the property and has been a lien on the property from the moment the loan was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.285" offset="13838779">So, that the entry of a bond creates no new obligation by the borrower it is merely a different procedure for executing against the real estate there are no two obligations, there is only one and it is the same obligation whether it is a bond or the mortgage payment of one discharge or the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="3468.221" offset="13946508">We could foreclose on the mortgage but that would be a wrong proceeding, you would have several defects sir.</text>

            <text syncTime="3477.847" offset="13985064">For another thing it takes much longer to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.112" offset="13998126">Thirdly, in today’s market with real estate dropping a hiatus of several months in foreclosure can be very serious in the position of the lender.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.903" offset="14041280">And as I pointed out this is purely a procedural question, whether we proceed on the bond or we proceed on the mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.328" offset="14066984">We think it is better for the lender to proceed on the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.592" offset="14080046">We think it is better for the borrower too because if we have a market where we can realize on our security more quickly, we could lend a larger margin under this lower interest rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.194" offset="14118393">Now, we pointed out below, that the Philadelphia area has the lowest mortgage interest rate in the United States and I am not saying here that this is the only reason but I am certainly saying this is one of the reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="3655.186" offset="14694446">This would depend on a particular levy in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.892" offset="14705208">In real estate it is certainly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.185" offset="14722449">Now, I pointed out before that the matter before this Court was a construction of the rules of our Supreme Court and I should like to point out that at no time has our Supreme Court been asked to rule on the validity of the same rules which it has promoted and it might be advisable to refer this back and therefore for our Courts to rule on these matters which have been presently never been ruled upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.691" offset="14844389">I think, I have tried to point out why the mortgage situation differs in large measure from the finance company situation and from the other situation under these matters which I think induce the Court below to making the exception of the situations where a savings, a loan or other lending institution lends money for the purchase of a home or for improvements to a home and we think this is an entirely different type of case from that one where lending is made for other purposes.</text>
