            <label>Mr. John F. Morehead</label>
            <text syncTime="35.247" offset="214680">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.613" offset="228159">My name is John Morehead, and I am here on behalf of the Democratic Party of the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.343" offset="255013">This case involves a constitutionality of political party filing fees as an absolute prerequisite to getting on the primary ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.658" offset="300257">This is an appeal from a duly constituted three-judged Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.616" offset="324185">The Court below held that filing fees violate the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.399" offset="379251">When used either as a revenue collecting device or when made an absolute requirement in order to get on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.825" offset="416972">There were intervenors in this case who desired to vote for the candidates who did not have the filing fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.516" offset="447692">Judge Taylor writing for the three-judge Court decided that since the intervenors wanted to vote for these particular candidates that this was really a voter’s rights case, and that therefore, in order for the State to sustain its laws, we had to meet the burden of showing a compelling State interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.134" offset="546226">Our position is that the primary question before this Court, is whether or not the traditional rational relation test of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to this factual situation or whether or not the State must show a compelling State interest in order to sustain its laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.705" offset="632534">To begin with, let me say that I consider the issues involved in a nominating primary or political party, to be different from those issues which are involved in a general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.152" offset="686242">The reasoning of Mr. Justice Stewart in Turner against Fouche, I think that is the correct pronunciation, seems to me to indicate that a filing fee is an absolute prerequisite to stand for office in a general election would amount to invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.708" offset="768476">The first question to be decided here today is whether or not the primary should be treated exactly like a general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.629" offset="808182">There is language in the 1944 case, Smith against Allwright with which Mr. Justice Marshall is very familiar, which indicates that the answer to my question is yes, and Smith, Mr. Justice Reed said, when primaries became a part of the machinery for choosing officials, State and National as they have here, the same test to determine the character of discrimination as a abridgment should be applied to the primary as are applied to the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.400" offset="955303">The Court in Smith was talking about a State statute which fenced off the rights of otherwise qualified black voters to participate in the democratic primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.373" offset="1011205">Since the decision of this Court in Smith, many cases have came before this Court which involved both voter rights and candidate rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.887" offset="1053210">The issues and problems have been definitionally refined to the extent that I think that if Smith were to come before this Court today, I believe that this Court would probably, would obviously reach the same result, but would probably use a little bit different wording than it was used in Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.386" offset="1135235">I feel like that it would be much more similar to, for example the case of Kramer versus the Union Free School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.710" offset="1172538">In order to get an accurate perspective of the issues in this case, a brief sketch of how Texas election systems work will be helpful to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.492" offset="1215587">Primaries are held in May, and under the laws as it exists today, the payment of the fee is an absolute requirement to get on the ballot, no write-ins at all are permitted on the primary ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.188" offset="1278386">In November, the election is free, no fees are charged at all in the State of Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.160" offset="1394265">At the top of the ballot is printed the words which say that I pledge to support the nominees, but of course no way that could ever be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.916" offset="1449331">And also in our November election, we have a much, much easier method for independent candidates or independent parties to get on the ballot then the Court was faced with in the recent case of Jenness against Fortson, there, this Court held that 5% was alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.023" offset="1537730">In Texas, it is 1% of the people for State wide election, and for local elections, it is also 1% except there is an absolute maximum, it cannot ever have to have more than 500 signatures in order to get on the November ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.295" offset="1606902">And so, as the Court is aware, this is a consolidated case involving three different candidates who desire to get on the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.279" offset="1638771">The two local candidates, the one for County Judge in Fort Worth and the one for County Commissioner out in El Paso, both of which counties have populations in excess of 300,000 people only needed 500 people on a petition in order to get on the November ballot.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.117" offset="1794147">You just get 1% of the people that want to support an independent candidate.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="434.927" offset="1813374">And by 1% of the people, you mean 1% of the eligible voters?</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Morehead</label>
            <text syncTime="438.860" offset="1829152">1% of eligible voters, not 1% of the people that voted in the last election, but 1% of the eligible voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.662" offset="1872306">Now, the state thinks that a political primary is an extension of the right to vote, similar to which this Court was faced in the McDonald case involving the absentee ballot for the inmates of the Cook County prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.466" offset="1947539">In a primary, you get to vote a second time, not only do you get to vote in November, but you also get an opportunity to vote in May.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.450" offset="1979512">And we therefore submit that this is an extension as also you can see that a candidate gets the right to run twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.326" offset="2006993">For example, Mary Lindsay lost in the Republican Primary for the Mayor of New York and was able to come back as an independent in November and still win the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.146" offset="2054223">We submit that the footnote in Kramer by Mr. Chief Justice Warren, which points out the distinction between fencing off case as happened in Kramer, where the man was not eligible to vote at all, and the type of case that you have in McDonald, which is an extension of the voting rights is a distinction which this Court should apply in this case, and that the three-judge Court when they applied the rational relation test, I mean, when they applied the compelling State interest test to the laws of the State of Texas, just simply used the wrong test and that therefore, if it were not for the press of the fact that we have new primaries coming up in 1972 and new deadlines to meet that the proper disposition of this case is really a remand to the three-judge Court to apply the proper test to the Texas laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.275" offset="2298729">We submit of course that the rational relation test is the one which this Court should use.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.595" offset="2320045">Now, even applying a rational relation test, we are still faced with the problem of does this filing fee as an absolute requirement to get on a primary ballot, which is a part of the election process constitute invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.306" offset="2394859">If the rational relation test applies, then we submit that the Court could look, should look to the other side of the question, and what purposes does the fee serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.170" offset="2442402">The fee serves two purposes to the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.531" offset="2455777">First, it serves the purpose of regulating the ballot and secondly, it serves the purpose of financing the actual cost of the election itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.353" offset="2503111">In other words, the candidates pay all the cost of printing of the ballots, paying the voting officials, all of the other incidental things, renting a place for use of the public schools, most of the time to hold the elections in, getting the pencils, renting the voting machines from the county and all of these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.810" offset="2576881">This is taxed to the candidates, and not to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.465" offset="2595480">On the face of this, both of these reasons would appear legitimate, but we still must look to the question of whether they have the effect of classifying an effectually excluding from the electoral process, people who are unable to pay for the fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="661.767" offset="2720763">To me, inherent in our constitution, both the United States Constitution and the State Constitution, we have an elective process, that is the way we select.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.364" offset="2759111">Our public officials is through election.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.100" offset="2770082">The ultimate election since that is the way we are going to run our Government; it seems to me must be borne, the cost of that must be borne by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.411" offset="2807281">And that someone who is unable to pay the fee there Mr. Justice, obviously must have the opportunity to stand for ultimate election, and it might be a legitimate purpose to have finance it that way, but you certainly could not exclude someone from a general election in November because of his inability to pay this fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="729.617" offset="2992123">Primaries worked there when we first started holding elections in this country and as I understand it, some states still nominate through, through convention as opposed to through primary, and the fact that someone is unable to get on the ballot in the primary election, does not necessarily mean that he cannot get elected, whereas if he is unable to get on the ballot in November, the door is closed, he is foreclosed of any possibility for election.</text>

            <text syncTime="1300.109" offset="5274076">The other alternative is that of course, you need to make the counties and State itself finance these particular elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.751" offset="5308662">And to say that the States must themselves finance it, and that that is part of Equal Protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, is quite a different thing as saying that the legislator can finance it itself, if it so desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.216" offset="5378565">In other words, to say that the State must finance it, is to say that somewhere in the Equal Protection clause, there is some sort of affirmative language which says that the state must act, that the state must hold this primary election and finance it themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.186" offset="5458396">Because I think that ultimately that whether it is $50 filing fee or $0.05 filing fee or $9,000 filing fee, that the filing fee itself, because you are always going to run into that one person or that group of people that the $50 is just as important to as or the $5 would be just as important or as Mr. Justice Douglas said in Harper that, that the $1.75 on Virginia, poll tax does not really have any valid relation to the man’s ability and right and qualifications to stand for all this or to vote for that particular matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2372.926" offset="9565367">Now with reference to the standard to be employed, as I understand it, there are three different standards that can be employed, the first is whether or not the articulated state goal can be accomplished in some less drastic means than the one employed by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.064" offset="9637883">And under Crammer, that question needs to be answered first before you go into the question of whether you apply the compelling justification test or the rational interest test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.736" offset="9692636">And I take the position that there is another less drastic way of regulating the ballot in nominating petitions and there are 34 offices included on the Tarrant County ballot in 1970 which is given in one of the exhibits in my brief and 21 of those offices could come off the ballot if we have legislation permitting single member legislative districts and single member judicial districts for Tarrant County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.129" offset="9818232">That trouble with the nominating petition I think would be a less drastic means than a filling fee to regulate the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.529" offset="9867761">But coming back to Harper, Harper plainly says that any fee is per se unconstitutional because it is irrelevant, the man's economic status has no relevancy whatsoever to his qualifications as a voter and Mr. Morehead pointed out the case from Georgia, the Turner versus Fouche case, he mistakenly said that that involved a filling fee when actually it did not, it required an ownership of real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.128" offset="10006210">But I think that the ownership of real property is equivalent to the ownership of personal property except in Texas, the state takes the personal property and the state of Georgia allows the man to keep his one square inch of real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.662" offset="10112371">Shelton versus Tucker, the breadth of legislative abridgment must be reviewed in the light of less drastic means for achieving the same basic purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.378" offset="10155212">Williams versus Illinois, Mr. Justice Harlan in a separate opinion conquering the matrix of recent Equal Protection Analysis is that the rule of statutory classifications which either are based upon certain suspect criteria or affect fundamental right will be held to the Equal Protection unless justified by a compelling government entries citing Sheparo, Harper and Williams and in this case, we not only have the fundamental constitutional right to run for elective office, but it is concomitant, the fundamental constitutional right to vote for the candidate who wants to run and in addition to those two fundamental constitutional rights which were involved, we have also this suspect legislative criterion of poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.906" offset="10341308">We have the filling fee limits the place on the ballot to the man with money and this means that his economic status has become a qualification for office and all of the three offices involved here are offices for the qualifications are set by the constitution of the state, and it is beyond the power of the state legislature to amend the constitution of the state and pass additional requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3008.504" offset="12107708">Well, the reasoning, Mr. Chief Justices, what I disagree with and that it limited only on First Amendment rights, what I am saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.338" offset="12155042">My position is that the right to run to office is as much a fundamental right as the right to vote, under the First Amendment of the United States constitution which guarantees political association and that that right should not be impinged upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.402" offset="12243232">That is my position and I think that if that is followed, it would eliminate exactly what is happening in Texas under this system, and that is a monopoly in government itself is what exists down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.184" offset="12326405">There is a monopoly because it is a government by the selected, for the selected and now the selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.618" offset="12376143">And I submit to the Court that the crux of the issue is whether the classification here which limits the right to vote or seek public office as a candidate is per se unconstitutional under the First Amendment which is the rights of freedom of political association and Equal Protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.235" offset="12458585">The candidate, I am speaking for the voter’s rights as well as of candidate’s rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.778" offset="12484812">This was, like in Rhodes, there, there was discrimination between parties and in that case, as Justice White inquired, is there a case from this Court that talks about First Amendment rights in connection with the right to run to office, and it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.646" offset="12576241">That is the case where they talked about First Amendment rights as a right to run to office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.881" offset="12605184">I agree that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment permits the states to make classifications and it does not require them to treat them uniformly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.912" offset="12665370">Nevertheless, it bans any invidious discrimination and that is exactly what is involved in this case, invidious discrimination, unfair discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.430" offset="12719392">The primary election is an organ of the state and as stated in that case by in Allwright case, when primaries become a part of the machinery for choosing official state and national as they have here, the same task to determine the character of discrimination to be applied to the primaries as they are applied to the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.138" offset="12842272">The general election, Your Honors and Mr. Chief Justice merely confirm the discrimination that exists in the primaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.941" offset="12889396">And the alternate about petitions for independent is not a reality in the political life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.981" offset="12929625">In fact, in checking that section of the law, those people that voted in the primary cannot sign those petitions for candidates, non-partisan candidates that run in the general election.</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.383" offset="13495228">It does not even say, wealth or property, it says money, cash, and when that is involved, when that is involved then they must, this Court must under its test give it a careful, scrutinizing examination and the state must show a necessary compelling interest for having such classification.</text>

            <text syncTime="3420.134" offset="13754259">I submit to the Court that this is a suspect classification that compelling interest test applies, I further submit that the excuses and reasons that they give for this legislation are wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the state's objective.</text>

            <text syncTime="3450.707" offset="13876512">That is speculative, that is remote, the other states have worked that out and the state can do it the same way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3456.689" offset="13900440">By a modicum of support petitions and not to couple it with alternatives, if one can pay, one candidate can pay a fee and the other one can get a petition to show modicum of support.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.472" offset="13947565">That is again violating the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.254" offset="13974732">So I respectfully submit to the Court that if we are to envision the true concept of government, of the people by and for the people that the opinion of the lower court be broadened, affirmed but broadened on the First Amendment rights and the Equal Protection rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.516" offset="14087685">That is as to candidates, they have a right under the First Amendment to run for office.</text>

            <text syncTime="3532.635" offset="14204192">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.505" offset="14219656">I would like to say initially for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.311" offset="14234912">I will comment one statement made in one of the briefs filed by the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.504" offset="14263646">Statement says, Texas you finance your great university, your school, your tremendous highway system, why do you fight the financing of the most essential duty of government, when you know that, the primary elections in the most part are tantamount to election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.740" offset="14328639">I think that this is one of the issues that comes up in this case because what in affect the trial court, the three-judge court below has done, is to completely do away with the financing system in Texas that we have for all of our election process with the exception of the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.077" offset="14429994">They have an effect said, Texas can raise a revenue or can take care of it in some source.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.498" offset="14459669">But really what in effect the Court has done, is say that the State of Texas are some lesser political sub-division of the state, well now, I have to take over this function that the political parties that wish to submit nominees for election on the general ballot are now doing, is in fact forcing the state to extend moneys, to allocate their limited tax funds or the local tax and bodies limited to another project which I think as you can see by the statements to pay are rather expensive at times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.150" offset="14626226">Now, this case really started out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.732" offset="14648587">I think we kind of -- it is kind of moved around and jumbled around a little bit to work really hard to see what we really have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.662" offset="14680352">It really started out with some particular candidates who did not have, but they have got adequate funds to pay the filing fees, challenging the heights of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.680" offset="14724342">During the course of this case, certain voters intervened that said that I would like to vote for a particular one of these candidates and actually what the court finally decided this case on was not the rights of the candidates here, is to whether or not, they had a right to be on about without paying some sort of filing fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.825" offset="14808979">What they said is that you have infringed upon some voting right of the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.910" offset="14841266">Now, I think what you did here is, that when we start talking about the voting right principles, we start talking about compelling interest and this is again the court said that there is no compelling interest for the state to have allowed this type of situation in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.013" offset="14949726">Well, I submit in this connection that possibly the court has used the wrong path in this case, they have used one of this voting principle cases, to decide whether these fees, was there any compelling answers to the state for these filing fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="4004.119" offset="16090128">I think sometimes we do not know what guidelines to do and if we are wrong in something and it does give the court opportunity to possibly see the way we are handling it, the way the legislature is possibly going to handle it to where, if we are incorrect that the legislature will know what next time possibly to do to correct any of these things, and this is my only explanation for this.</text>

            <text syncTime="4047.888" offset="16265253">This is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.285" offset="16274761">But we submit that the payment of we think that, what we have got here in this particular case is that there are several methods that a person can reach of the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.200" offset="16326484">They can do it under a banner of a particular political party, they can run in the general election on a write-in, I mean by getting on the ballot in the manner provided at the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.074" offset="16385939">I think that the court below said that some right of the voter had been infringed upon here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.900" offset="16425227">Actually, what the court has said that a voter has a right to vote for a particular candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4095.475" offset="16455529">And if the state by its statutes and regulating the election process does anything to keep a particular voter from voting for a particular candidate of his choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.687" offset="16508401">If anything keeps him off the ballot, be it the filing fee or some other problem of having to do something, keeps him off the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.027" offset="16553749">Then, it is constitutionally bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.965" offset="16565556">We think that what has been done here is actually, the burden has not been put on the voter, by the law the way it is, it has been put there now because ultimately, by this statute being held invalid, the tax payer who is also the voter is going to now have to pick up the path for these elections rather than the camp.</text>
