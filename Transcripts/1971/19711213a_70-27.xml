            <text syncTime="952.263" offset="3882685">However, 80 years later, this Court considered that was not so and held it applicable to all of the Courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1764.112" offset="7130123">The position of the appellees before the Court is that a Three-Judge Court properly concluded that the Anti-Injunction Statute was an absolute bar that 1983 was not an expressed exception to that particular provision and property declined to grant injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.173" offset="7218312">The question that is not before the Court is whether the Court erred and perhaps, declined a grant declaratory relief, thus we do not have the dilemma raised in the sextet, Younger, etcetera, wherein Justice Brennan I believe you discussed the differences that may exist in declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.522" offset="7303785">So, I wish to make it clear, subsequently the Court declined to grant declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.697" offset="7328445">But that has not been raised on an appeal as it has not been assigned as in here and has not been argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.659" offset="7348298">So, I will not address myself to the question of whether they should have perhaps gone on and granted declaratory relief for whatever purpose it may have served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.506" offset="7391661">The only reason I mentioned that is I know that there is a question on the Court as to whether the same standards were always applicable to a declaratory relief as opposed to injunctive relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1890.298" offset="7634809">The position of the appellees is that Atlantic Coast Line is absolutely dispositive of the issues raised herein and that 1983 is not an exception to 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.605" offset="7688098">Now, I have cited in my brief several cases specifically so holding and we are relying on in the main case of Baines versus the City of Danville out of the Fourth Circuit, 1963 wherein that Court made a lengthy analysis of the problems that would be created in this situation, the confusion and the disorder over one -- a Federal Judge attempting to get into the bonafideness with a lack thereof of the prosecutor and the trial judge or any other institutional officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.885" offset="7833235">They also concluded that unlike the Removal Statute which implicit within that very statute itself is that the Court has total jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.241" offset="7882658">I would agree that by necessary corollary that when they remove it they had it for all purpose of singularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.435" offset="7915364">There is no such antagonism when we are talking about 1983 and 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.851" offset="7941068">In fact, all 2283 is, is a limitation upon the chancellor’s authority to engage in a certain limited type of injunctive relief, although he may occupy a general grant or general power of equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.512" offset="8011703">And I would suggest that is clearly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.060" offset="8021943">Civil rights actions, authorized injunctions against university presidents, penal institution or wardens, all sorts of people wholly and completely unrelated to the criminal State prosecution or indeed a civil prosecution, and I -- in that context I would note that while there has been some suggestion that because this is civil case we have a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.495" offset="8127687">But Mr. Justice Stewart, in footnote 3 of your concurring opinion noted that there is no distinction in the civil, in the Anti-Injunction statute itself as a civil and a criminal provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.022" offset="8185783">Secondly, I thought if the law was that each party had the right to seek out its own forum, and I would be a guest if I were a State plaintiff, suddenly thrusting a Federal Court as a Federal defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.348" offset="8239073">And now I, having to fight my way back into the Court that I selected first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.870" offset="8257150">So I would suggest that because it is civil, should make no difference as to the application of the Anti-Injunction Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.456" offset="8291527">Moreover, the State in fact is a party in these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.196" offset="8310440">The State is trying to implement a substantial State interest that they have and that is expressed in the penal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.915" offset="8341369">Under Kingsley Books, Inc. versus New York, this Court recognized that we could use alternative methods, civil and criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.260" offset="8374701">We have elected to attempt the civil.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.089" offset="8385986">In this context, I would like to tell the Court that I am fully aware of, painfully aware of I might add in light of the Florida Supreme Court’s reversal of my judgment that it was an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.074" offset="8445963">I would agree that I was wrong just as was the Trial Judge was wrong in Atlantic Coast Line but that is not bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.319" offset="8478982">Many of us make mistakes, I frequently do and I think I would probably will in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.370" offset="8503119">Indeed, my argument right here maybe a mistake and yet I would suggest that an erroneous initial application and a subsequent declaration that I was wrong cannot retroactively go back and impute into me a bad faith on my effort to merely auger a legal position that may or may not prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.401" offset="8587233">Many defendants claim the rights of Gideon long before they prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.833" offset="8608967">So it is not unusual that the prosecutor on occasion is going to be auguring a position that may be contrary to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.556" offset="8639896">But I think that is the way the law gradually is effectuated and made more meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.913" offset="8665287">So, for these reasons, I would suggest that it makes no difference whether it is civil or criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.315" offset="8686916">Going back to Baines versus City of Danville, I find it very interesting that in Hemsley against Meyers, an 1891 case, involving a situation not unlike this where the defendant, the State defendant attempted to put the Court or the parties in a squabble more or less to divide and conquer by thrusting the State into a Federal State collision to get this worked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.592" offset="8804049">In the meantime, there is delay, there is protraction, there is confusion and no one is properly distributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.923" offset="8829336">That judge in the Hemsley case, in 1891 concluded that it would just be chaos to allow the question begging that goes on invariably in these kind of lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.097" offset="8874058">Is the Statute constitutional?</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.454" offset="8879491">Is there bad faith?</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.779" offset="8884820">Etcetera, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.891" offset="8893179">Interestingly, in that case, Judge Caldwell completely interpreted 720, Section 720, the predecessor to 2283, consistent the way this Court did in the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad case, that it is an absolute bar unless you can fit within one of the exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.264" offset="8978756">And that the exception which then did not exist, the Civil Rights Act was not an exception to it that the Civil Rights Act did nothing to change the relationship of the State Governments and the Federal Government that they remained reasonably intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.200" offset="9046466">I say that this is consistent and it shows the history, the history because this was 20 years after the Civil Rights was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.494" offset="9083664">That at that time the framers did not in fact intend for the Civil Rights Act to be a repeal of the principles recognized in Atlantic Coast Line which are embedded in the Tenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.132" offset="9142178">I would say that that dispute that is going on that went on with the framers that Mr. Justice Black talked about, that there were those who disagreed as to whether we should have independent Federal Judiciary to determine all federal questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.914" offset="9201320">I say that that debate was resolved by the framers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.419" offset="9215321">But the debate rages on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.377" offset="9223158">And debate is brought to this Tribunal, is actually brought to this Tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.355" offset="9247086">And I would urge to this Court that this is not the proper place to bring it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.600" offset="9272059">The reconsideration or the reevaluation of the policy decision made 200 years ago more properly rests in the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.185" offset="9310407">And I would buttress this by noting that this Court, when they talked of the Removal Statutes in a Civil Rights setting not in a “dirty bookcase” a legitimate Civil Rights Action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.841" offset="9381042">In construing the Civil Rights Act, this Court took the view expressed by the Fourth Circuit in, again Baines versus City of Danville, another case but related to the removal and strictly construed that and said that statute of this vintage ought not be loosely construed into providing the relief they want to it as Justice Holmes noted to cut red tape and intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.917" offset="9493369">So I would suggest that this Court’s interpretation of the Civil Rights Act and you noted in there the absolute chaos that would result in this respect, the appeal of the removal ruling, perhaps to the Court of Appeals and a denial of cert to this Court and the hearings to be conducted 200 miles away, you noted that a year and a half later after all the legal proceedings were over, it might get back to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.261" offset="9610711">Or I would like to relate this aspect to the case --</text>

            <text syncTime="2901.226" offset="11678564">Yes and Your Honor what -- at page 466 of the Hobbs opinion you will see this, I would like to just read it; “In the instant case, we are not even faced with the force and applicability of the Anti-Injunction Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.519" offset="11731749">The present challenge to the Macon Ordinance and charter provisions not only is outside the criminal sphere but also poses no possibility of interference with pending State proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.332" offset="11771037">The present challenge simply requests relief against allegedly unconstitutional State action in the form of conditioning and employment upon the surrender of political activity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.399" offset="11815236">Now, that is nothing but Baggett v. Bullitt, where you said you could not make a man surrender his employment in lieu of signing a loyalty oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.835" offset="11864974">So, there was nothing estranged about Hobbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.913" offset="11877303">If it did not interfere with the State proceeding, why do they go into discussing the import of Younger, all they now have done is create a morass and I read it out, I do not know what the law in the Fifth Circuit is which goes to the point that I guess the appellee have stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.410" offset="11947311">There is clear authority that this Court should not interpret 1983 as an expressed exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.692" offset="11968418">Why should you not?</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.124" offset="11978136">First of all, the practical problems mentioned in Greenwood versus Peacock and I cite these in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.927" offset="12005408">Just like in the Jack Dawkins case that I alluded to early this morning, 200 miles away, 18 months later and we do not have a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.233" offset="12038636">Those are the practical problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.220" offset="12050547">Moreover, in every case you are going to hold a hearing to determine the bonafideness whereas I think Mr. Justice Brennan noted that normally you should be able to look at the pleadings to determine who first filed it and not ought to be end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.328" offset="12106972">And I say that a construction that I auger for, avoids the necessity of these hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.951" offset="12129437">And I might add this, every time Your Honors, every time a hearing is held and it is denied the appellant is going to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.924" offset="12165382">I mean, the plaintiff is going to appeal if it is denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.789" offset="12176771">If it is granted, I tell you the State will appeal because it cannot afford to have an order in the books declaring its officers in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.855" offset="12209058">Consequently, there will be direct appeals to this Court from every Civil Rights case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.894" offset="12229225">Anyway, I think the Court could take judicial knowledge of the increase in Civil Rights actions brought before this Court under 1983 in the face of a pending State proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.184" offset="12274365">Another reason is that I think that this, a construction similar to mine promotes the speedy, orderly dispensation of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.887" offset="12313235">In Florida, we have adopted a new rule guaranteeing a speedy trial within 60 days or an immediate release.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.089" offset="12337999">The Court docket is not an excuse, nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.216" offset="12350538">If the man is not tried within 60 days he is unconditionally released.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.093" offset="12370077">All this will do is delay and protract the legal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.536" offset="12387840">Is this Court’s interpretation as they suggest necessary to the enhancement of justice and the promotion of liberty in this country, I suggest the answer is in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.149" offset="12434234">The Fourth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, the Seventh Circuit and the Second Circuit, the largest Circuits in the United States had held that is an absolute bar in 1983 is not an expressed exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.471" offset="12479582">I would ask the Court, if those jurisdictions were a copy maintained because it is an absolute bar, which means they do not get a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.681" offset="12516363">Have our people suffered such a deprivation of their liberty that had has posed a serious threat to the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.849" offset="12545098">I would suggest the answer is in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.099" offset="12558054">I think that our State Courts are in trying to the best of their abilities and to the ability that God gave them to do justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.090" offset="12598074">Now, occasionally that may even be questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.078" offset="12609986">But on those rare occasions that it does occur, this Court through its greater jurisdiction because it is the ultimate arbitrar of all actions can take care of these needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.416" offset="12667351">Indeed, that is where I brought my complaint for relief in the MNW Theater’s case were bad faith was stipulated not to exist and Judge Arnold enjoined.I sought a stay order of Mr. Justice Black granted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.919" offset="12721372">It is now pending before this Court apparently to be disposed off in light of whatever you do in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3390.577" offset="13635971">And we can thrash that with what they want, disorder, chaos, fillet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.991" offset="13665646">I am not impeaching their integrity or the morality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.908" offset="13677349">All I am saying is that if I were a defense lawyer and this Court has noted in Stefanelli, every defense lawyer would be obliged to come forward and raise this on behalf of his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.541" offset="13719876">That is the only benefit that will come from such a ruling and I respectfully urge this Court to affirm the action taken by the Three-judges in the case of law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Eugene Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="3427.516" offset="13783720">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.705" offset="13792497">A few very brief things, Mr. Judge Fitzpatrick in the 6th day of April 1970 reentered his preliminary order, held that the activities of the defendant in Panama City were prima facie injurious and damaging to the morals and manners to the people of the State of Florida were prima facie subversive to public order and decency and prima facie constituted to public noise and nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.925" offset="13905346">And that the plaintiff had demonstrated irreparable harm and damage, the plaintiff in that case being a State to the morals and welfare and safety of the people of State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.502" offset="13943694">There was no evidence before that Court of any kind in that regard and the Court ordered there further, hereby, enjoins from operating and maintaining any business on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.083" offset="13993953">And are further enjoined from removing anything from the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.765" offset="14008686">And thereafter, an immediate request was made were superceduous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.208" offset="14026449">Staid the effect of the order Your Honor so we can appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.552" offset="14039824">No, we would not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.264" offset="14046720">Immediate request for superceduous was made to the Court of Appeals and they denied the same and by order denied the same and said that they could not say that the Judge below was in error and denied us the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.673" offset="14108369">We had to await our appellate relief there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.870" offset="14117147">Thereafter, a federal suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.581" offset="14128014">And although, Judge Fitzpatrick said, the defendants can have an expeditious hearing time and time again, defense counsel filed a request for an expeditious hearing and it was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.348" offset="14167093">It was for this reason that the Federal Court intervention was sought because we felt that the whole circumstances were and the irreparable harm was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.371" offset="14199171">We wanted to prove our bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.141" offset="14206276">We felt the use of a Nuisance Law and the way it was used in this case was erroneous and we felt we would like to have the right and we would like to have the right to go back to a District Court and so demonstrate that to the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3544.261" offset="14250685">Well, Mr. Smith, if we should decide this case in your favor on the inapplicability in this case for some reason or another, if Section 2283 or more precisely if we should decide either the 2283 words were not inapplicable or that one of the exceptions therein provided were applicable -- applicable this one in 2283.</text>
