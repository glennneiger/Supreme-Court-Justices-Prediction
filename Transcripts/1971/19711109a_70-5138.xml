            <label>Mr. David A. Scholl</label>
            <text syncTime="27.381" offset="183233">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.780" offset="184801">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.886" offset="189189">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.079" offset="202041">In this case, this is another action which is a class action, brought by a group of consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.315" offset="230985">This is similar in effect to the Swarb action which was also class action instituted on behalf of all of the residents of the state which had been subjected to a certain procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.924" offset="273408">For that reason, I would like to refer to the plaintiff, the appellants as the consumers although, I think that is partially a misnomer in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.334" offset="307054">The appellees, I will refer to as the creditors again.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.678" offset="320428">Well, again it is partially a misnomer.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.111" offset="334117">Well, what is in question in this case is the Pennsylvania procedure of replevin with bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.499" offset="359717">The Pennsylvania procedure of replevin with bond is similar in many ways to the Florida procedure which was considered in the Fuentes case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.209" offset="394512">However, there are very important distinctions on Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.656" offset="412275">As was pointed out in the arguments in Fuentes case, the replevin seizure in Florida is part of a proceeding which has already been commenced which will ultimately determine the rights of the parties to the particular goods which were seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.183" offset="474446">That is not the case in the Pennsylvania replevin with bond procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.854" offset="493046">All that a creditor need to file in Pennsylvania to commence the replevin with bond procedure are four things.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.136" offset="522198">One of these things as an entry of appearance, the other is an affidavit of what the value of the goods are, then he is going to go out and have seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.318" offset="554904">The third thing is a bond and the bond must be in double the value of the goods that are being seized and the fourth thing is merely a praecipe to that which is directly to the prothonotary, asking or ordering the prothonotary to issue a writ of replevin at bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.392" offset="619269">Now, what need to be included in such a praecipe?</text>
            <text syncTime="139.972" offset="633584">Well, really nothing, except that it is just the direction, a form just as a direction to the prothonotary to issue the writ of replevin?</text>
            <text syncTime="148.225" offset="666603">prothonotary as I had mentioned in the Swarb case, this morning is merely a court clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.789" offset="684784">All that the court clerk does is to examine to see whether in fact the four pieces of paper that have to be filed have been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.441" offset="711429">And if they have, he then ministerially issues the writ of replevin with bond to the sheriff and the sheriff is required to go out and forcibly seize the property from the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.589" offset="760017">Now, this is the distinction in the Pennsylvania procedure, not only from the Florida procedure which was considered in Fuentes but also, even the procedures in New York which was the subject of the Laprease versus Raymours Furniture case and in California which was the subject to the Blair versus Pitchess case.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.768" offset="836712">Both of these cases held that the procedures involved there were unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.542" offset="867850">Another important feature of the Pennsylvania procedure which is probably distinct from Florida because it is not actually the beginning of an on-going process which is going to determine the party’s rights to the goods, is that for all practical purposes when the seizure is made by the sheriff, that is the end of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.370" offset="947158">Usually, nothing further is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.133" offset="954159">Now there are three possible ways in which the consumer can possibly get that property back, and these three only.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.173" offset="986342">The first is he can file the counter-bond within 72 hours of the seizure of the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="237.898" offset="1025317">Well, he is never advised of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.976" offset="1033571">In fact, in the Pennsylvania rules of civil procedure, there is a form set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.598" offset="1048095">It is Rule 1354 and it is included in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.547" offset="1067844">I believe it is included in our appendix, appendix A to our brief, and the form has nothing in it which states that the consumer can file a counter bond to recover the property.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.846" offset="1181111">There are two other ways that the consumer could possibly get the property back eventually.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.620" offset="1204203">The one is that, he could file a praecipe with the court which would require the creditor to commence an action to finally determine the rights of the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.345" offset="1239103">Of course in the intervening time until that complaint is filed and until it comes to a hearing, the consumer is going to be deprived of the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.708" offset="1272539">The only other possible way that the consumer could get the goods back would be to commence an actual of replevin with bond themselves and get the goods back from the creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.088" offset="1305976">Of course, this is also going to require them to put up the bond.</text>

            <text syncTime="653.965" offset="2689526">The Court below, recognized that the case of Sniadach versus Family Finance Corporation, which of course concerned a prejudgment wage garnishment seizure, in Wisconsin, this court held was violative of due process because it deprived the consumer in that case of wages prior to determination of the creditor's rights to it was closely analogous to this case and I think that principally, the best way of presenting this case on appeal is to discuss what the court below said and tried to establish how what the court said, did not have support either more in reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.259" offset="2834662">Now the court relies heavily on the fact that what was concerned within Sniadach or what this court was concerned within Sniadach was wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.512" offset="2867681">The Court, in fact, holds that because Sniadach concerned wages, therefore, Sniadach cannot possibly have any direct relevance on this case with the seizure of personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.322" offset="2915015">I would submit that there are two rationales by which the reasoning that the Court below suggested can be rebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.314" offset="2946884">I think the first arises when one considers that what is challenged here is a procedure by which certain property is taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.511" offset="2983769">The taking of the property of course is an instance of the procedure but it is the taking of the property before there is any determination of the party getting it has any right to it, that is really in question and should it make any difference at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.705" offset="3040507">Whether it is wages or whether it is personal property or whatever it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.065" offset="3053986">It is being seized prior to their being any notice and opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.954" offset="3073526">I think that this court’s decisions in Kelly versus Goldberg which of course concerned welfare benefits and the Bell versus Burson case which has already been discussed suggest that this Court did not intend the language in Sniadach to be delimited or did not intent to delimit its ruling in the Sniadach case solely to wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.321" offset="3146982">However, I think there is an alternative grounds, on which the court's reasoning can be rebutted and that is that the property seized here, which is the personal property of four persons is equally specialized as the wages that were concerned that the court was concerned within Sniadach.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.159" offset="3226290">What we have here, in fact, in the case of the Parham’s, we have a bed, a table and stools which were simply seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.630" offset="3256174">Now these are things which the Parham’s as welfare recipients simply cannot go out and replace.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.100" offset="3278117">It would take many months of saving and even them perhaps, they would not be able to save enough to replace the goods that are seized.</text>

            <text syncTime="913.527" offset="3727736">That it can be used to seize anything and in fact, one of the parties before the Court was involved in a case that was not a consumer transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1012.220" offset="4122603">Now, what happened is that he fell behind on revolving account and he was paid up to date with the time payment account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.614" offset="4152174">So governing employees’ exchange which was the creditor concern at his particular case filed a writ of replevin and came out and seized all the things that he bought on the time payment accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.964" offset="4197522">Now, there is some question as to whether they even had a security interest in those goods on even assuming that somewhere they could produce a contract which showed that there was a security interest and goods purchased in the time payment accounts for violations in the revolving account such a security interest would probably be invalid because we have a case right on point decided in the District Columbia Circuit which indicates that such a security interest is unconscionable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.835" offset="4353003">That is that the creditor can define what the security interest is and what he thinks the security interest extends to before he goes out and replevins the goods.</text>

            <text syncTime="1129.239" offset="4590613">In fact, they had made a $25.00 payment in August of 1970 and made a $20.00 payment in the beginning of September 1970 and then a week later, Sears Roebuck, except $20.00 payment came out and replevied the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.426" offset="4643380">And by this time they had paid off, I believe approximately $200.00 of the $384.00 debt, that they originally had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.556" offset="4679952">I think that the Parham’s, they had an opportunity to get in the court and raise any defenses that they might have had.</text>

            <text syncTime="1645.451" offset="6655436">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.228" offset="6702561">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.951" offset="6721473">I represent solely Sears, Roebuck in this matter, as an appellee, but I do think I should mention one or two things where I feel there has been some misunderstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.319" offset="6774972">Much is made of the Washington case and then impropriety of the repossession there that there was no right to immediate possession or title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.872" offset="6813215">There was a hearing held in this case by the Lower Court, where Mr. Washington himself was summoned and so was the plaintiff Mrs. Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.753" offset="6852712">Mrs. Washington did not appear nor did her attorneys and the court after hearing testimony of Mr. Washington, vacated the injunction that had previously issue and the order to return the goods, saying on page 29 of the record, “it now appears to the Court that the representations upon which the Temporary Restraining Order, September 8 issue were incorrect, both as to allegations contained in the complaint and representations made by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.559" offset="6979877">Accordingly, we will both vacate the order of September 18.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.318" offset="7002969">Thus, there is a finding in the Lower Court on the merits of this controversy which has never been controverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.649" offset="7036301">Secondly, I would like to call to the court’s attention that while no complaint is filed in Pennsylvania replevin procedure, the bond itself signed by the person making the replevin and signed by a surety which must be an improved surety by the Court which is decided by the judges themselves, not the prothonotary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.345" offset="7127103">There must be a corporate surety and twice the amount of the goods, but this bond says specifically that if, that the plaintiff claims the right to immediate possession of the goods and that if he does not sustain this in an action, in the action then he is liable to the defendant, the value of the property, all legal costs, fees and damages, sustained by reason of the issuance of the said writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.717" offset="7256566">Now, I would further call to Your Honor’s attention that this procedure is before that the first instance before a prothonotary of the court and his deputy clerks of the common police court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.420" offset="7319364">The fact that a complaint is not filed at the beginning is taking care of in my opinion by this bond where the man finds himself a replevying party and his surety and says he has a right to immediate possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.409" offset="7383312">But more than that, the rules are replete as is the Original Act of 1705 in Pennsylvania, with immediate actions that the defendant can take to turn away the writ, the effect of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.419" offset="7439318">True, he can file a counter-bond within the 72 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.975" offset="7453529">If he does so, then he immediately gets the property back, but as Justice Marshall has indicated, this does not result in a back and forth bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.416" offset="7503370">It requires as the rule says that all actions of this nature shall follow the rules of assumption in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.183" offset="7534404">There are must be a filing of the complaint immediately upon at this time by the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.822" offset="7556974">There is a right to answer and then it comes before the court either, on a jury trial or by mutual waiver jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.879" offset="7589157">Now second, there is also an immediate right under the rules to move, to adjust the bond, to cancel the bond, to take over the prothonotary to say that they can move the court immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.343" offset="7643073">They go immediately to a judge to move that the prothonotary’s action in issuing this bond is improper and to limit the bond, to discharge the bond, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.986" offset="7689571">So there is really an actual -- let us see, this is one of rules here which are attached and says specifically that the bond can be adjusted and that there can be, it can be thrown out in fact by the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1953.309" offset="7886952">Now, in addition to this situation, a replevin action is Pennsylvania is never dead until a complaint has been filed, served upon the defendant and judgment entered either by default after 20 days or after hearing before the court and there are provisions in the rules stating that the court has the right to give damages on either side, substantial damages, it can hear the entire case either before a judge or before a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.219" offset="8010564">Now, I submit that under these facts, that there has been compliance with constitutional rulings of this court throughout its previous history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.198" offset="8082453">I think it has been indicated in this Court that a party first, taking advantage of a statute cannot be sought -- seen to come in and to attack the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.034" offset="8149849">And this was in the very case of Fay was just Mr. Justice Douglas referred to as an exception in the Sniadach case and the Court specifically said and I think that opinion also was, I know that was by Mr. Justice Jackson said that if you take advantage of a statute, you cannot attack its constitutionality.</text>

            <text syncTime="2079.353" offset="8391116">In this action, replevin is merely a procedural remedy to enforce the rights of the creditor given by the Commercial Code, the right to self-help, plus the right to replevy by court action if this is so desired and this is how the plaintiff’s rights in this case arose in this property by this very Commercial Code and certainly, you cannot if they just strike down the replevin action.</text>
