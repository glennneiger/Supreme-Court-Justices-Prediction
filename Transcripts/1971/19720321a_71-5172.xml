            <text syncTime="69.383" offset="351251">I was intrigued this morning to hear the comments of the Court regarding the Right to Counsel and the Need of Counsel in the way that cases and I'm like save primarily that I've related to Mr. Wade that this Court didn't realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.105" offset="414049">But the reason I was interested was that this case I think the issue raised herein focuses on the need to have the undivided loyalty of counsel throughout every stage of criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.238" offset="466608">If I could recite briefly the facts here and because I feel the very important to set a proper framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.362" offset="491163">My client is to do he was arrested in hard of March 1967 with charge of violation of Connecticut's uniform narcotics theft.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.106" offset="530137">He retained at Hartford Attorney by the name of Zaccagnino, who was the Senior Partner in law firm by the name Zaccagnino, Linardos and Delaney to represent him and that office entered and confirmed appearance in the lower Court for preliminary hearing on the arrest of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.833" offset="609027">Down May 9, 1967, when the Mayor was set down for trial in the Hartford Superior Court, Mr. Dukes appeared with his Attorney, Mr. Zaccagnino, and at that time Mr. Zaccagnino moved that he be permitted to withdraw from the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.503" offset="667646">As Counsel for Dukes' because as he put it to the Court at that time he has slight conflict with his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.573" offset="695963">In that matter was argued by before the trial Judge at that point and the Court denied the motion for Mr. Zaccagnino's withdrawal but continued the case 24 hours to give Dukes a chance to get another lawyer.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="167.099" offset="742043">Mr. Wade, what are on your -- the basic view of the point where the records is the third interpretation of Mr. Zaccagnino's remark to the trial judge to end something of a kind of its called.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_a_wade" startTime="178.273" stopTime="285.483">
            <label>Mr. James A. Wade</label>
            <text syncTime="178.273" offset="786764">My judgment would be that that he was trying to convince Dukes to plead guilty and that Dukes didn't want to plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.239" offset="814663">And that this was conflict these are the Zaccagnino and Dukes.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.091" offset="833994">I can't say fairly that at that point Mr. Zaccagnino was trying to appraised the Court but there was some other conflict other than that would be my best judgment, Unknown Speaker Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.995" offset="881641">In any case, when my Dukes left the Court room on May 19, he went out the hallway of the Court and was rearrested by the Hartford Police and taken to the Hartford Police Station on a unrelated charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.193" offset="938484">And he -- while he was at the Police Station took some pills and became sick and he was taken to a hospital and stayed there for a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.370" offset="967114">And then came back in the Court on May 16th with Mr. Zaccagnino's Law partner Mr. Delaney and at that time entered a plea of guilty to the narcotics charge in a minute to the information charging into larceny receiving stolen goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.639" offset="1028240">At that time, the Trial Judge made an inquiry about the voluntariness of the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.839" offset="1053004">The matter was sat down for June 2nd for sentencing but on the 2nd pre-sentence report was not ready on the Dukes matter and so the case was continued again.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.453" offset="1091457">Mr. Zaccagnino was in Court with his client Mr. Dukes for sentencing but it went over another two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.538" offset="1119878">But on the second, Mr. Zaccagnino appeared before Judge Demon, the Hartford Superior Court, with two girls whom he was representing on charges that were entirely unrelated to Mr. Dukes' charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.960" offset="1181527">But I might say that Mr. Dukes had been arrested in that case as a codefendant and was represented by another Hartford Attorney in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="295.227" offset="1254565">So at the time of sentencing, the girls by the way they have said guilty earlier to the charge, Mr. Zaccagnino stood up to make remarks on sentencing on the behalf of the bureaus and the fact that goes for a moment here to read in page 68 of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.547" offset="1327813">During a remarks on sentencing, Mr. Zaccagnino in speaking on behalf of the girls said, "That both of them came under the influence of Charles Dukes."</text>
            <text syncTime="323.028" offset="1365742">Now, how they could get in a position to come under the influence of somebody like him, that Your Honor please, face the problem here that I think is the cause of the whole situation and then the last part of the last paragraph there, "As the result of their willingness to cooperate with the State Police, they can officially dope in the making if plea."</text>
            <text syncTime="341.659" offset="1440348">I think Your Honors, since I was on both sides of the case having been on the other side of the other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.888" offset="1461246">I can tell Your Honor that with these girls that because of there refusal, it is not refusal, not to cooperate with Dukes and to testify against him that could pixilated him undertaken a plea, he will shortly been remove from society.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.254" offset="1514640">And on page 70 of the Appendix, once again referring to the girls and their cooperation with the police, Mr. Zaccagnino said the Court, "It is obvious in looking at the report, who the most capable person is because he have all the instruments with which the Dukes these girls."</text>
            <text syncTime="382.503" offset="1603666">Then.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.189" offset="1646402">And then on June 16th, two weeks later, Mr. Zaccagnino and Dukes was back on trial, same trial judge, Judge Dillon would heard these remarks about the girls, they're back infront of that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.666" offset="1704289">Now, at this point Dukes himself move to Court as guilty plea they would make him and he wanted to go another lawyer and he did not want Mr. Zaccagnino to continue represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.742" offset="1756639">Well, the Court denied that permission and ordered the case go forward and they are find him pose to sentence of not less than five but more than 10 years on Mr. Dukes.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.574" offset="1807943">Now, is it our contention to that counsel for Dukes at that time was such as to render the entire proceeding including the guilty plea invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.449" offset="1859457">Its our contention that he was denied the effect of assistance of counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.438" offset="2487440">They felt that it headed all the way back to the guilty plea and decide, what is he getting adequate advice that the time in entered the guilty plea.</text>

            <text syncTime="649.715" offset="2672492">Now, this Court is not really spoken to this point since 1942, when a classic proceeding was handed at and that was situation where the defendant itself was an Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.948" offset="2721497">And there were two, it was single counsel representing him at another codefendant the defendant Glassier here was a former United States Attorney, existing United States Attorney charged with conspiracy of violent between before the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.866" offset="2781161">This point and that point was very explicit point out that in a formal proceeding that the defendant should have representing him, a person whose interesting are untrammeled by possible conflicts of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.558" offset="2847930">And the Court laid down a touchtone which the lower Court said well done as far as I can see.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.172" offset="2870395">Since 42, they laid down as a touchtone to determine whether or not that assistance of counsel wasn't paneled.</text>

            <text syncTime="725.280" offset="2974781">The obvious reason is that he was appearing before a trial judge on June 2nd, he can blame upon hi client shoulders, on behalf of the girls saying that this poor girls would let down the fact of provision by Dukes and then two weeks later, he had to appear before the same judge and implore mercy for his client whom the adjusted story in two weeks before.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.212" offset="7234516">He assumed that there's a conflict of interest, in many cases his whole arguing on that and he also presupposes that there was prejudice to the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.622" offset="7288119">Neither of these exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.994" offset="7309644">In order to have a conflict of interest, it requires more than just joint representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.707" offset="7348515">It also requires that there be antagonistic interest between the people jointly represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.240" offset="7386653">Now, you don't have that worked who have two separate cases, one in the Narcotics License Case, one the girl's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.298" offset="7430853">Now, let me give you the actual background here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.651" offset="7440257">So, that the Court will understand just what happened and you will see that there is no conflict of interest here nor and never was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.814" offset="7480903">In this check case with the girls, Dukes was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.019" offset="7497726">He was using these girls going on all over the State in Connecticut, cashing checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.039" offset="7521863">The girls cashed the checks that he would furnish to him, some where traveler's checks, somewhere money order, somewhere stolen checks with names imprinted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.577" offset="7551956">He gave his drivers licenses and other identifications, and this went around in most of the towns of Hartford New County, into the New Haven County, in the Fairfield County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.055" offset="7593857">Now, the State Police go on with this investigation in November and December 1966, and as a result it, if the girls were picked up and when were they pick up they told the State Police the whole story, verse by verse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.440" offset="7655401">It gave statements, affidavits, the whole things and a s a result of that, of course they were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.756" offset="7684658">And by the way, they were four girls and another man involved in this besides Dukes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.618" offset="7716110">Consequently, a warrant was issued for the arrest of the girls in December of 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.266" offset="7742755">A warrant was issued for Dukes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.554" offset="7755920">Now in the warrant for the arrest of Dukes, one of the affidavits supporting that warrant was a statement from the girls or one of the girls about Dukes involvement in the check case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.017" offset="7797716">So, Duke knew it from the arrest warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.851" offset="7809106">In Duke's case also, there were two other charges added into his warrant that had nothing to do with the check case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1943.740" offset="7848603">Alright, that case it's into the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.463" offset="7863545">The girls have cooperated; they got Mr. Zaccagnino to represent them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.853" offset="7885070">He was representing the girls and Dukes knew it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.054" offset="7901893">Dukes also knew his involvement with the girls.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.614" offset="7916103">While Mr. Zaccagnino is representing the girls in the check case, Mr. Duke went to him and said "Will you represent me in the narcotic case."</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.146" offset="7962288">A new narcotic case, not the one that was involved in the bench warrant, because on March 14th, Dukes got arrested again for selling narcotics, and this is the case in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.566" offset="8023937">This is the case that in the appendix where the search warrant is there, where they went in with the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.162" offset="8050373">They had made purchase from Dukes did before the warrant is executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.772" offset="8064792">They went in his house and found all kinds of narcotics, a perfectly group solid cold case and also found stolen goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.592" offset="8100005">That is the two counts that he pleaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.073" offset="8114007">Now, when these cases all came in the Court and I have some more cases in the Supreme Court against Dukes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.897" offset="8137308">I looked at the files and I set the case to try.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.239" offset="8150578">Is the last narcotic case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.958" offset="8161550">The one where there was a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.497" offset="8171685">What we had a cold case, Dukes was second offender, he was warned above and I set the case down for trial, and told Mr. Zaccagnino to be ready as soon as we go to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.985" offset="8221631">The record shows Mr. Zaccagnino was there and this by the way was the 2nd of May, the week of the 2nd of May 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.622" offset="8256113">Mr. Zaccagnino was there and he hang around for that week and on May 9, he came on, we've got a Court room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.210" offset="8282549">And now we've come to the proceedings in the Court on May 9th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.139" offset="8298222">Meanwhile, the girls case has been going separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.710" offset="8316508">They wasn't any connections to this narcotics case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.868" offset="8329151">The girls were witnesses on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.783" offset="8336779">They have nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.233" offset="8342630">It's never been claimed that had anything to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.386" offset="8355169">The girls have pleaded guilty, and their case were waiting to be sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.181" offset="8374395">And there's no connection whatsoever with this case which was right for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.391" offset="8395189">Now, when he got ready for trial, he had to be pin him that in order to get the plea, and that's when we there's conflict to which we came up between Mr. Zaccagnino and Mr. Dukes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.255" offset="8446702">And it says in colloquia on May 9th, this is like conflict between my client maybe because Mr. Zaccagnino with his best judgment was advising him, "You've got to plead guilty", you've got all these cases pending against you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.857" offset="8513053">He have warrants outstanding on the check charges in New Haven in Fairfield County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.843" offset="8553073">He had this good case that we were getting ready to try, which was a cold case and Mr. Zaccagnino knew it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.145" offset="8582226">And so, he was saying to Dukes, "Your only chance here is to plea guilty and wipe out all these cases at once."</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.714" offset="8608557">And our Board of the States Attorney and get a recommendation, which he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.303" offset="8630918">It didn't go on May 9th because it was continued because of this Zaccagnino advising him and he hadn't taking his advice and it was continued for one day, then it was postponed for a week, went over to May 16th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.279" offset="8690790">On May 16th, Dukes came back in the Court with Mr. Delaney, Mr. Zaccagnino's partner, and the same thing happened all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.898" offset="8729243">I was ready on Court with the Courtroom and a Jury and the witnesses to put the narcotics case on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.625" offset="8756201">And finally, after a lot of negotiations during the morning, Mr. Dukes pleaded guilty and the proceedings of May 16th show that and this is when Judge Johnson, now is the judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2206.799" offset="8900919">Now, you want to here last week with Mr. Zaccagnino, and there seem to be some doubt in your mind about whether you wanted Mr. Zaccagnino when you were looking to get other Councel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.632" offset="8944178">Are you satisfied today with his partner, Mr. Delaney?</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.220" offset="8958598">And you can see all of these in the May 16th transcript and the questions, you know you're giving up your right to trial now.</text>

            <text syncTime="2231.748" offset="9000707">And all went in the guilty plea was accepted and it was referred for a pre-sentence report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.210" offset="9030487">It was assigned for June 2nd for disposition?</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.985" offset="9049608">Mr. Zaccagnino in accordance with the plea bargain arrangement with me asked me asked me cases consolidated from Fairfield County in New Haven County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.211" offset="9090568">Plus all the cases we had in Hartford County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.705" offset="9104466">And you know, from the appendix in the respondent's brief that in order to consolidate those cases, it's required that guilty pleas be entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.753" offset="9140724">Both States Attorneys have to agree with the consolidation and the statute says, "He must plead guilty to all cases."</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.487" offset="9167577">Which he was going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.020" offset="9177713">It went to June 2nd, the date it was assigned for disposition, and you'll see there is a short proceeding on June 2nd where Mr. Zaccagnino says, "This case Your Honor has to be postpone because the consolidated cases from the other Counties haven't got here, also the pre-sentence report wasn't ready."</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.937" offset="9257439">So, it was put down for disposition now to June 16th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.597" offset="9280113">Now, that morning in Court on June 2nd, Mr. Zaccagnino then appeared with the girls in the check case because it happen to be that the check case was set down for disposition of the girls, the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.723" offset="9340613">Now, I don't claim that Mr. Dukes was in Court, when the girls where sentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.122" offset="9362137">He probably wasn't, because he couldn't be there for the continuous and not stayed for the girls part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.826" offset="9388991">But on June 2nd when the girls were sentenced, Mr. Zaccagnino made these remarks about the girls, in the girl's case about their involvement with Dukes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.910" offset="9433295">Now this is what happened, those remarks where before the Court in the pre-sentence is required on the girls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.163" offset="9462343">The whole thing in stage was laid up to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.630" offset="9480211">The prosecutor when he got up said, "These girls got into this thing because of Dukes."</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.637" offset="9504244">The girls statements was attached to the probation reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.015" offset="9521693">Said the Judge Devon now, the sentencing judge, had before him everything about the girl's in the check case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.289" offset="9550846">And in that information it said that Dukes have used them to cash these checks.</text>

            <text syncTime="2375.587" offset="9576028">All these was a set of facts that Mr. Zaccagnino had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.152" offset="9594314">And he didn't do anything about manufacturing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.987" offset="9605599">He didn't do anything about them all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.932" offset="9613435">He simply said, "Your Honor this is it."</text>

            <text syncTime="2392.553" offset="9643842">But it is seen in the record that Supreme Court in Connecticut looked up on him, and it says in its opinion specifically, that postpone that thing was laid out before the Court in the girls probation reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.134" offset="9694206">So, what Mr. Zaccagnino was saying to Judge Devon about the girls, was before him anyway?</text>

            <text syncTime="2414.464" offset="9731509">Supposing the girls were represented on that day by another lawyer, not Mr. Zaccagnino.</text>

            <text syncTime="3010.078" offset="12113981">The first place when this habeas corpus was started, long after the direct appeal now, and after Federal habeas corpus and nothing was said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.903" offset="12149298">He started the habeas corpus from the person and he mentioned the conflict of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.041" offset="12177824">Well, I would then have wonder how could he hadn't known about that at this time in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.959" offset="12213559">And then right after he started the action and before Mr. Wade was appointed for him under articles conviction proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.600" offset="12244070">He wrote a letter to the clerk of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.596" offset="12256087">He then give the letter to the clerk of the Court, this is in the files.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.983" offset="12273641">He said, "Would you please send me your transcript of what Mr. Zaccagnino said about me and the girl's case, said that you would on wouldn't bail me."</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.743" offset="12312616">Now, it's obviously he had ignored what they said because he started his habeas corpus action before this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.300" offset="12334872">Because he says in the letter, "I want to use this transcript in my habeas corpus hearing that is coming up."</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.321" offset="12362980">So, that made he had to ignore about it himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.991" offset="12385654">Now, since he have to ignore about it, he must to know about on June2nd and that's the day on June 16th, two weeks later, that he knew about it, he should have told Judge Devon, that I'm not being properly represented because of a conflict of interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3171.468" offset="12759519">Now in his plea, that if you're going to allege this kind of a conflict of interest, there's a duty of notifying the Trial Court, and give the Trial Court a chance to rule on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.401" offset="12811241">Here you have what we're saying in this case, if this case is reversed.</text>
