            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73731">First this morning in Number 70-5012, Milton against Wainwright.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.794" offset="112810">Mr. Rutledge, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Neil P. Rutledge</label>
            <text syncTime="13.703" offset="128484">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.133" offset="142172">This case is on review of a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which affirmed a denial of a writ of habeas corpus which was challenging a conviction of first-degree murder in the State Courts of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.853" offset="217091">The first-degree murder conviction occurred in 1958 and became final, that is in the sense, that the appeal procedures were completed and the time expired for petition of certiorari in this Court in 1960 after, I mention that fact because this is after of course the decision of this Court in Spano versus New York, a 1959 decision which occurred after the conviction of the Trial Court before that conviction became final.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.443" offset="359406">The facts involving the alleged crime itself are fairly simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.790" offset="392843">The petitioner in this case, the defendant in the State Trial Court was a black man from Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.228" offset="426593">He had completed less than six years of schooling in the Mississippi Schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.750" offset="448640">He was age 23 at the time of his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.434" offset="463373">He was working as a porter in a Miami Beach Hotel and he was living in the black ghetto section of Miami with his common-law-wife who was at that time pregnant.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.455" offset="519484">On the evening of May 31, after he got off work, he purchased a cheap used car for approximately a $100.00 and then that evening he took his wife out for a joy ride which ran through the evening and apparently there was some drinking during the course of that evening in the ride in the new car.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.993" offset="629617">In the early morning hours of June 1, that is about 2 or 3 a.m., he ran the car into the Miami River and his wife was drowned.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.342" offset="691057">The petitioner himself barely escaped with his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.904" offset="705267">He was fished out of the Miami River by a boat captain and he was incoherent and he injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.036" offset="737868">He was prostrate on the bank of the river when the police came and the police took him to the Dade County Hospital where he was admitted to the colored section, the hospital at that time being segregated, and he was held there overnight and then the next day, he was taken to the city jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.179" offset="818430">No charge was made against him and he was placed in the city jail in a cell 3 feet or 4 feet x 6 feet in dimensions with no windows and with a solid door.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.075" offset="877989">There was electric light in the cell which at times would be turned on and other times he would be in complete darkness and he was held incommunicado in that box of the cell for 16 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.869" offset="949147">During that time, he was taken out from time to time for interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.374" offset="979135">He was put in that cell on June 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.420" offset="991360">On June 3, he was taken out early in the morning about 6 a.m. and was taken by a detective to a room where a Medical Doctor, a Psychiatrist and a Ph. D. Psychologist administered truth serum to him, shoot in the arm with a truth serum, he was then questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.967" offset="1073594">Of course he had no lawyer, he had no friends, and he was not allowed to make any telephone calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.187" offset="1094387">He asked to call his wife’s family, but he was not allowed to communicate in any way with the outside world.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.029" offset="1129809">After the session with the doctors and under the truth serum he was then the next day taken out and hooked up the wires to use his words and administered a polygraph test.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.118" offset="1182159">And then the day following that, he was again questioned at which time an alleged consent to search his rooming his quarters were extracted from him and pursuant to that alleged consent, the detectives and the medical examiner of the county searched his quarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.549" offset="1255824">He was questioned again at various times, he says almost daily, for long periods, up until June 11, at which time he was taken from his cell at about 5 p.m., and was not returned to the cell until about 1 a.m. the following morning and during that time from 5 p.m. of June 11 until the early morning hours of June 12, two confessions were extracted from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.519" offset="1391765">He claims and the evidence, of course he is in dispute on this, he claims that he was subjected to threats and coercion that the detectives threatened to take him for a ride out in the country and so forth at that time and that he had no choice ultimately, but to agree to confess that he had driven into the river deliberately in order to murder his wife, the motive being to collect insurance on her life and it is true that he had an insurance policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.631" offset="1524154">Actually, it was a policy that covered both him and his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.449" offset="1535439">It covered healthcare and it was an accidental death policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.509" offset="1551739">It is one of these policies that is commonly sold in the black ghetto where the collector comes around every week and it is very expensive insurance actually, but you pay your premiums in cash each week.</text>

            <text syncTime="382.862" offset="1605133">How long has (Inaudible)?</text>

          <turn speaker="neil_p_rutledge" startTime="387.522" stopTime="830.047">
            <label>Mr. Neil P. Rutledge</label>
            <text syncTime="387.522" offset="1623733">A relatively short time.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.951" offset="1629480">I think the policy had been in effect only several months.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.254" offset="1650691">I am not sure that the precise date that the policy was taken out appears in the record, but there is some evidence from which you could conclude that he originally had one kind of policy and then he changed it comparatively short time before this incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.982" offset="1737627">During this session on June 11, he was questioned in extensive by two detectives, Detective Holmes (ph) and Detective McClure (ph) and they resorted to the rather customary technique of tandem questioning that is one man would question while the other one is in a secret room adjoining from which he could observe through a one-way mirror what was going on and of course unbeknown to him the room was wired so that whatever he said in there would be recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.620" offset="1872209">The man in the secret room behind the one-way mirror could turn on the recording device and record what was said.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.895" offset="1909303">The detective testified that he had only one hour of tape and so out of the entire time from 5 p.m. until 1 a.m. that he was out of his cell, only one hour was put on tape and the tape begins at a point where the petitioner was saying that he wanted to confess and that he proposed a little charade where he would go out of the room and then knock on the door and come in and say, I am appearing here voluntarily to confess and that it was stated that he had asked that this little charade be gone through in order to demonstrate that he was doing this voluntarily and freely.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.237" offset="2098639">He says that he would had been coerced into doing this and once he decided he had to confess why he wanted to get whatever benefit he could from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.186" offset="2142420">In any event, it was only after they had extracted these confessions on June 11 that and then the next day on the 12th, they took him down to the scene of the incident and took photographs of him that was in the sense the third confession, the first one was on tape, the second was a transcribe, a secretary typed up confession which he signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.563" offset="2259971">The third was this incident on the 12th when he was taken to the scene and then again on the afternoon of the 12th he asked to change his statement and a fourth confession was typed up which he signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.481" offset="2335622">Only after that was an attempt made to arrest him for any specific crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.909" offset="2365297">After these confessions were extracted, the detective went down to the magistrate and swore out a warrant for his arrest for first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.020" offset="2397793">This resulted in his being transferred from the city jail to the county jail and then in the county jail, he was allowed finally to make a telephone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.652" offset="2436245">He called out and obtained a lawyer immediately, but even though he had been arrested and changed to the county jail, he still was not brought before any committee magistrate and the attorney that he was able to contact by making a telephone call on June 19 filed a habeas corpus petition which resulted in a preliminary hearing and at that time he was brought finally before a magistrate and was committed over to the grand jury and the grand jury indicted him for first-degree murder on July 1, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.930" offset="2589427">He was not able to post bail and so he was held in the county jail pending his trial which occurred in December of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.986" offset="2637597">On July 18, the state for some reason, unexplained, feeling that it needed more information from him, knowing that he was represented by counsel, knowing that he had been indicted decided that the way to obtain this information was not in a straightforward way by either approaching his counsel or even by as calling him in and seeing if he would voluntarily answer questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.092" offset="2753999">Instead, they resorted to the technique of taking a Negro police officer and dressing him in civilian clothes and having him pose as a fellow prisoner and one who supposedly was in jail being held also on a charge of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.503" offset="2843651">And this police officer whose name is Archie Langford entered petitioner’s cell on July 18 at about 4 or 5 p.m. and then stayed in that cell continuously with him except for one brief moment when he was taken out shortly after he entered the cell on that Friday, July 18 evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.492" offset="2951693">Other than that short time of less than five minutes when he was taken from the cell, Officer Langford was in the cell continuously for 45 -- approximately 45 hours from 4 to 5 p.m. on Friday, I mean, excuse me, from 7 to 8 p.m. on Friday until 4 to 5 p.m. on the following Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.883" offset="3041241">The testimony of Officer Langford is clear that he was trying to extract information.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.064" offset="3065901">He went into the cell with instructions to get information from the petitioner and he tried to get petitioner to talk about his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.050" offset="3097875">Petitioner refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.107" offset="3106129">Petitioner told him that he had been instructed by his lawyer not to talk about his case and he repeatedly, over and over and over again, said I do not want to talk about the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.793" offset="3148866">He did not talk about the case that Friday even though that Friday evening he was woken up out his sleep by the officer and still refused to, the following morning he refused to talk about his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.521" offset="3207798">It was not until approximately noon the following day that the officer by use of rather clever and adroit psychological techniques was able to get the petitioner to start talking in little bits and phrases about the case and then it really was not until in the wee small hours of Sunday morning that as Officer Langford describes it himself, the petitioner broke down under this continuous pressure and told, as Officer Langford states it, the full story about why he went into the river, saying that he had gone in the river in order to collect the insurance to kill his wife and then to collect the insurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="848.442" offset="3467455">It certainly amplified motive and it supplied this confession, this last confession was the one used and relied upon most heavily by the State in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.974" offset="3513535">It was the first one introduced and it was referred to repeatedly in the final argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.898" offset="3537254">One purpose obviously that they used this last confession was because the State was going for the death penalty and in the course of this confession to Officer Langford, the petitioner had commented to Langford who supposedly was being held or being involved in a murder with a white man or actually a Chinese man was his fake story.</text>

            <text syncTime="1254.505" offset="5091749">In the later collateral attack in the Florida Court, as far as I can tell, he attacked the admissibility of this July confession as being involuntary, although I cannot say categorically that that is so because the opinions do not shed any light.</text>

            <label>Mr. Neil P. Rutledge</label>
            <text syncTime="1312.843" offset="5325075">Your Honor, I stated in my brief that I could not say candidly that the petition in the lower court presented as a matter of pleading or as a matter of argument the validity of these first four confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.636" offset="5396232">However, the evidence before the judge in which was the state's prior transcript did contain all of this information and we do submit that it is relevant in the totality of the circumstances that you cannot simply savor this case into independent blocks and that the confession that was extracted in July by the use of Officer Langford was merely a continuation of a post scheme of depriving this man of his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.757" offset="5552758">But even if you look and address yourself only to this confession that was extracted in July, we say first of all that thoroughly there is no way to distinguish what the state did in that case from what was held in Messiah to be impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.657" offset="5640320">Here is a man who is indicted on the most serious charge of all, involving a capital offense and he had a lawyer and (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.304" offset="5682848">The State seeks to go around the lawyer and extract a confession from the accused in a way which obviously it could not have done if he had been -- if he had the benefit of counsel present, if there had been notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.375" offset="5751184">Now, the real question is whether that case, the Massiah case should be given the normal, usual application or whether it should be limited by what we say is a comparatively new doctrine, the Doctrine of Non-retroactivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.392" offset="5823282">Now, this doctrine is new in the sense that up until the Linkletter case in 1965, no decision of this Court overruling a prior decision based on the constitution, interpreting the constitution had ever been limited to prospective effect only or given less than the total effect that normal decisions have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.822" offset="5932996">Now, the doctrine of the Linkletter Doctrine, the Doctrine of Non-retroactivity of course has roots going back to the Sandburg (ph) case of Mr. Justice Cardozo which held that a State Court, Montana Court could give only prospective effect to a decision in a civil case without violating the Due Process Clause and certainly it is now settled by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.697" offset="6028500">If there is no constitutional impediment to giving a new decision of this Court, a new decision, only prospective effect or limited prospective effect and we do not propose the challenge that contention, but we do say that one, the Doctrine of Non-retroactivity is a new one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.122" offset="6138214">Secondly, that there are obvious disadvantages to it as well as advantages and these have been discussed at length by Mr. Justice Lignose (ph) and Justice Black, the late Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Douglas who had dissented consistently from the application of this doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.803" offset="6220866">Now, what are the disadvantages?</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.022" offset="6229747">One is obvious and that is that it produces and apparent inequality right away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.715" offset="6260572">In other words, as Professor Courier (ph) in his article in 51 Virginia Law Review cited in the Williams case posed it, the prospect of two man involved in the same crime in the same cell and one of them simply by the chance that this case was tried earlier gets the benefit of a new constitutional ruling and goes out whereas the other man at the same time that he is, the first man is freed on habeas corpus, the other man is lead down to the gas chamber and this inequality, this surface inequality certainly is something that causes people to pause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.957" offset="6425457">There is also the fact that if the logic of the Non-retroactivity Doctrine were followed completely that we would have merely an advisory opinion or law dictum, but the most important reason for not applying that we submit is that the doctrine itself has the potential of doing serious damage to the image of this Court in that the power of this Court from Marbury versus Madison has been the respect of the people for this Court as the final expounder of a constitution as the court that does not make law and when the court acts like a legislature and limits its opinion only to prospective effect, the Court then is subject to the charge well-founded or not, of legislating like a Court, like a legislature rather than interpreting and applying the constitution as the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.832" offset="6681039">And so we submit for this reason the doctrine should not be applied unless there is a sudden new change in the law and Massiah we say was not a sudden new change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.881" offset="6737254">Massiah, as the opinion itself states, stemmed from Powell v. Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.097" offset="6758048">It was expressly anticipated by Spano versus New York and the Spano case as I pointed at the very beginning came down before the conviction in this case was final.</text>

            <text syncTime="1765.612" offset="7136092">At the outset for the sake of clarification, I think that we ought to talk about the confessions, that were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.519" offset="7171723">In fact, I think if you -- the best way to look at this confessions is one the major confession that is being talked about in the petition of certiorari which was the confession which was elicited by Officer Langford in the cell of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.002" offset="7241731">Secondly, there is one other confession which also was discussed by the courts at the state level which is referred to in the petitioner’s brief as 405 Confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.904" offset="7293244">In fact what it is one confession that was taped, that was transcribed, that was changed, that was initial, but essentially we have two and the second one I refer to is that confession which was made to Officers Holmes and McClure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.961" offset="7349564">Now, there is in fact in the record and I think you will find it in our brief one statement which might in fact be considered the third confession and that statement has never been challenged at any level and that is from the record on page 148 when Officer McGraw arrived at the scene of the crime, he was asked, when you saw this defendant lying on the pavement, describe if you will what he was doing, what he was saying if anything?</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.411" offset="7455308">He replied, well, he kept insisting he drove his car into the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.557" offset="7475893">Now, in terms of argument, this is quite important so again there is the Langford, Holmes, and McClure and this other confession of Officer McClure and I think that these distinctions have to be kept in mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="1892.450" offset="7643494">Well, in this case, he is saying in effect that he did drive it into river whereas at the trial I think it goes more of the question of credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.457" offset="7691455">At the trial what he said was he blank out; he does not remember what happened, as far as his story of what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.826" offset="7716951">Here he says, yes I did drive into the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.298" offset="7726877">Again, I think this is equivocal, but I think it raises some question about credibility of his own story of what took place and I think that is important in terms of the facts that were presented at this trial because there are constant discrepancies in terms of the stories that were told and I think there are constant considerations here of credibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.971" offset="7809529">I would like to talk about those considerations somewhat further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.062" offset="7821963">Again, that is equivocal as a confession, but it does disagree with the story that he told he blanked out that he does not remember what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.611" offset="7856131">So how does this is interpreted is not totally clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.961" offset="7881522">And far as the facts in this case go, there are number of things, it was stated by the petitioner and he was questioned almost daily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.589" offset="7920079">A couple of these questioning periods had to do with cases which were another jurisdictions that are asked when you hold him for investigation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.152" offset="7946306">They came down, they did interrogate him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.199" offset="7954456">The longest questioning period was one where the -- it was either Polk, Florida or Mississippi, I feel which one of the two came down questioning for six hours about another alleged crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.037" offset="8001790">Now, they asked him at the state hearing and this quite important and it is in our brief, they said to him, you were not questioned between the 4th and 11th?</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.157" offset="8038257">Now you notice, they are saying constant questioning, long questioning, great deal of psychological coercion and pressure and this kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.050" offset="8069917">The petitioner was asked, you were not questioned between the 4th and the 11th?</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.802" offset="8084859">He answered, I could have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.140" offset="8094263">The Court: Not could have been, were you or were you not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.208" offset="8106489">You were there, you know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.817" offset="8112967">You are the only one that can tell us and it is in the petitioner from the 4th day to the 11th, I believe that I was questioned, I mean, I was trying to think.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.128" offset="8150165">I believe, I was questioned sometimes during the time from the 4th to the 11th and on it goes, he can identify three periods Your Honor, the longest period being roughly one-and-a-half hours during this time that he was held for questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.744" offset="8204604">So this matter of constant questioning in terms of all the confessions, now this goes to the Holmes and McClure confession which is not the one which is a primary basis for the petition here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.789" offset="8252879">He says -- the petitioner claims well, he was asked to write to his wife’s family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.168" offset="8270329">This has to be clarified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.311" offset="8274926">He apparently has another wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.074" offset="8281927">Minnie is not his real wife as far we can tell and he would said no, I could not, I could not, I was not even allowed to write to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.168" offset="8314319">I think if you look at the appendix, you will find three pages later where he say, yes, I did write her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.369" offset="8335112">He said I was not even given stationery, three pages later, he said yes, I did write to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.145" offset="8354234">Now, another point as far as facts goes, the petitioner points out this is a common type of policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.918" offset="8373355">I think it is also worth pointing out that in the record, John Tyler took the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.168" offset="8394358">He said, I was asked by the petitioner where I could get in his own words a good insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.083" offset="8417973">I think it is also very important to know that the petitioner was unable to sustain and so very effectively, in fact one witness took the stand, told him how he hacked the suit for $2.00 because he was short of cash yet he managed to keep up the payments on these insurance policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.282" offset="8482756">Now, with that in mind, I would like to get to the issues in terms of the structure of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.331" offset="8506998">First of all as we pointed out in our brief and rely for the Langford confession, if there is any error at all which we deny and I like to get to this in more details in a moment, but if there is any error at all it is clearly harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.860" offset="8565094">First, we still have the Holmes and McClure confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="2215.952" offset="8937496">There is a lot of testimony about his relationship toward the deceased, Minnie Claybon that he does not particularly care for her that he has written to others how he was coming to a great deal of money which would further his boxing career.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.121" offset="8994129">If you look at the record on page 150 to 152, it tells us some important things about the scene of the accident.</text>

            <text syncTime="2238.480" offset="9027566">There was good weather.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.116" offset="9034149">Utmost, there was one space with estimates ranging from 15 to 25 feet of opening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.139" offset="9070198">The rest was a solid line of both, so that if someone lost control of the car, the odds I am getting in that particular 15 to 20 foot opening certainly were not very great and Your Honors this is particularly important in this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.269" offset="9130802">The back windows in this car were closed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.678" offset="12984386">I do not think that in modern criminal law, retroactivity is a normal application and I think that the decision of this -- the decisions of this Court have made that absolutely clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="3242.174" offset="13042378">You stated that as the combination of those factors and you ruled in a number of cases on whether a particular decision should be retroactive or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.463" offset="13079576">And it seems to me that the same rationale was governed in the Johnson case, the same rationale which governed in fact in Linkletter applied in this particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3267.592" offset="13144046">The purpose to be served in this particular case is to deter the police from interrogating when a lawyer is not present.</text>

            <text syncTime="3344.651" offset="13452291">I think the decisions in Johnson, the decision in Linkletter make it clear enough that the purpose, first of all, the purpose would not be served by making it retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.156" offset="13498267">Secondly, that in this type of situation, in the Massiah situation, Massiah, the confession that was elicited in Massiah was not one that was believed to be coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.958" offset="13545496">It was not of those beliefs to be unreliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.725" offset="13556572">In fact, there was believed to be all too reliable and so the basis for getting rid of that kind of evidence by making the rule retroactive again is not necessary in this particular situation.</text>
