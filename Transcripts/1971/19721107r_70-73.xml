            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">We’ll hear arguments first today in number 70-73, Miller against California.</text>

            <label>Mr. Burton Marks</label>
            <text syncTime="13.106" offset="156797">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.105" offset="168814">We’re back again before the Court, since January of this year to reargue the matter and to discuss with the Court what one of my colleagues described as the continuing saga of life in the pits or what goes on in the lower courts because we don’t know what actually this Court is saying with respect to the pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.508" offset="262437">The second proposition that we have to this Court is that a person charged with the crime of obscenity should have perhaps as much rights accorded to him or her as, let’s say a parolee who is being having his parole revoked or perhaps a juvenile who is being declared a delinquent.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.816" offset="363687">Perhaps I can explain.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.686" offset="375181">As I said, there is a continuation of horrors.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.857" offset="387824">In January, I described to the Court what happened in this case, what a defense lawyer had to do to go through a trial or proceeding in order to at least have attempted to have some kind of hearing as to whether or not the material was constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.548" offset="474551">This included pre-trial hearings in which evidences presented by the defendant, none by the prosecution and a complete denial of any real hearing in my opinion, understanding by the trial judge as to what the issues were.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.066" offset="548634">Since that time, to give you an example of what occurs in the courts below because of the erratic, if I may say types of decisions which emanate from the higher courts and perhaps, the visceral reactions that occur with various judges is.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.310" offset="633584">I’ve been in three trials since I’ve seen it and this Court in Wiener versus California held certain material to be protected vis-à-vis Redrup.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.503" offset="690427">Now, the Wiener materials were down in San Diego and they involve some motion pictures and some films.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.266" offset="717490">So, we -- I had two trials in Los Angeles in which I attempted to have the judge take some recognition of the materials in Wiener, so that there could be a comparison of what was protected and what was not protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.765" offset="779452">Now, the interesting proposition is that the prosecution --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="172.302" offset="793558">Well, was this a jury trial, Mr. Marks?</text>

            <text syncTime="173.627" offset="798887">No, we waive jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.888" offset="807978">The interesting proposition in the first trial that I had was that the prosecution had an attorney who was reasonably experienced in the pornography field.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.769" offset="855521">This prosecutor was unwilling to admit to the Court as were the police officers who were are really the experts because in Los Angeles they a vice squad with pornography experts that travel through and the State and they know what’s going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.144" offset="912990">The State refused to admit that the materials in my case were the same as the materials in Wiener.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.532" offset="938486">And as a matter of fact, refused to take judicial notice of the fact that they were the same and there was simply no way to get the Wiener materials from San Diego to Los Angeles because they had been introduced into another case in San Diego to try and persuade the second judge that the materials were the same and therefore protected.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="227.000" offset="1012360">Mr. Marks, this perhaps is unfair precisely on the point that you’re arguing but you said you waived juries in both these recent trials?</text>

            <text syncTime="234.470" offset="1042244">In the -- in the last, well, the first case I did because the judge that we finally got was, in my opinion, sophisticated enough to understand what was going on.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.448" offset="1086234">What, as a matter of trial tactics and defending cases like this, you would ordinarily prefer a bench trial to a jury trial?</text>

            <text syncTime="253.608" offset="1118835">Absolutely not.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.027" offset="1124477">No, the -- because if you’re allowed to have the procedures which the California State allows you to have, you have -- you should have under Noroff a real pre-trial hearing to determine whether or not the material is obscene.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="273.598" stopTime="275.031">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Burton Marks</label>
            <text syncTime="275.031" offset="1204517">Which would end the case but the unfortunate proposition is, as I was going to point out is that the judges simply don’t follow the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.725" offset="1255299">They don’t -- perhaps, it’s merely a matter of buck-passing and as former President Trumann said, the bucks got some --</text>

            <text syncTime="296.241" offset="1289362">But I take it that, it was a determination of obscenity at this pre-trial procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.354" offset="1309842">That is not the conclusive of course at the jury trial, is it?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="burton_marks" startTime="316.310" stopTime="367.316">
            <label>Mr. Burton Marks</label>
            <text syncTime="316.310" offset="1369610">Sometimes what the judges feel or believe is and there’s some California case law to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.203" offset="1401166">Although it really does not seem to be appropriate because ordinarily, we’re talking about a misdemeanor case in obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.212" offset="1429274">The only time you get into a felony case is when it is bootstrapped into a felony by virtue of the charge of conspiracy which makes it a felony or because a person has a second offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.176" offset="1473055">Now, if you have a misdemeanor trial, there is no such thing as a preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.140" offset="1496984">There -- so, the California Supreme Court gave misdemeanants in a pornography case essentially what might be called a preliminary hearing through the Noroff case in which you are entitled to have a hearing to determine whether there’s obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.489" offset="1558319">Now, some judges believe that this only means probable cause.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="367.316" stopTime="370.167">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="367.316" offset="1573679">Are misdemeanor cases tried by it before jury?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="burton_marks" startTime="370.167" stopTime="574.396">
            <label>Mr. Burton Marks</label>
            <text syncTime="370.167" offset="1585068">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.979" offset="1592278">Some judges believe that this obscenity issue in determination means only probable cause to believe that’s obscene, so it will grow in front of a jury, that is not my understanding of the law but there’s no clear-cut decision on that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.999" offset="1656435">In a felony case, if you happen to have a felony, then you have a preliminary hearing and in that preliminary hearing, there is a probable cause situation to believe that a crime has been committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.410" offset="1710038">Again, there is a case out of California called Luros which says that the grand jury does not need any evidence to make a determination of probable cause, so that the matter can be brought before the petit jury for a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.423" offset="1774090">But then we have again this intermediate Noroff step which supposedly is suppose to have the judge independently make a determination of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.281" offset="1817558">It’s always been my expression or opinion that the proof of the prosecution as to obscenity in a pretrial hearing has to be also beyond a reasonable doubt because if it’s not obscene, it can’t be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.934" offset="1872102">But, as I say, this leaves the law in the state of flux and nobody really seems to care.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.189" offset="1905121">I was talking about the trials that I had.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.733" offset="1919331">But what happened was the Wiener, the two defendants had been arrested in a practically the same situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.064" offset="1948693">They were the type of defendant that you will ordinarily find and as far as I can determine, 90 to 95% of the cases which come before this Court or before any obscenity court, i.e. a book seller, a motion picture operator, somebody who is in business, not the skulking pornographer who goes out into the alleys and calls in the little kids and says, “Look at the dirty pictures.”</text>
            <text syncTime="490.498" offset="2066348">He’s there, he has a store, he has a business, he has a movie theater, he invites no one in except by the advertisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.046" offset="2100621">Generally, if you take a look, for instance, you open your Washington DC newspapers and there’s advertising for what’s known as adult films and it doesn’t pictorially describe what’s being shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.227" offset="2149313">It gives the title and the persons who are the, to say the aficionados or the -- who want to go to the theatres, know what’s going to be shown on the theatres by the fact of the title and the place where the theater is and they go and see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.756" offset="2207410">But I’m talking about the client, the person who is in business, he’s operating a store, he buys film, he buys books and he sells it to the persons who come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.793" offset="2247534">Ordinarily, there’s no such thing as pandering as was described in Ginsberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.346" offset="2273761">Simply, a police officer walks in, sees a piece of material that he doesn’t think is a worthy of his consideration, either makes an arrest on the spot, although that is now out in California but generally, will go back and make an affidavit that he saw a dirty book or a dirty picture and he will describe why it was dirty and then some magistrate will sign a search warrant and they’ll go in and seize that.</text>

            <text syncTime="580.663" offset="2427047">Apparently, there is not enough funds given to the vice squad to purchase this type of material.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.507" offset="2450453">They have other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.997" offset="2460379">They generally go in and they look at the pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.847" offset="2475739">My two clients happen to have arcades on Main Street where you have peep shows and little motion pictures theatres.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.037" offset="2508549">Police officers went in, saw the films, went back, described what they saw or what they thought they saw, gave the affidavit to a magistrate, authorize the seizure, they came back a few days later, seized the film, took it to the police station then had an arrest warrant issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.539" offset="2574587">Both clients were charged with felonies because they were, had a prior misdemeanor.</text>

            <text syncTime="656.714" offset="2731217">He finally read the material and lo and behold after an entire trial in which the police officer testified in their expertise as to what was obscene and not obscene and my expert had shown the comparison between Wiener material and these materials, the judge granted my motion to dismiss on the grounds that the material was constitutionally protected and returned the films to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.062" offset="2832677">The next case was exactly the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="687.848" offset="2855769">I went into the second judge who had never had a pornography case, never had an obscenity case but of course knew what was obscene and not obscene, tried to persuade him that this case that I had today was exactly the same case as the case I had yesterday and that in fact the ruling of the judge before was res judicata because it wasn’t an acquittal.</text>

            <text syncTime="880.433" offset="3626172">Also, if it’s protected, it can’t be seized but the big problem is how do you get word to the judge that it’s protected?</text>

            <text syncTime="982.722" offset="4035250">Because if I see a magazine that shows a picture of a naked woman with her legs spread but is known in the trade as a beaver shot and this Court has said, “That’s protected.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.633" offset="4106930">And I see another magazine with a woman with her legs spread and a beaver shot with a different title and a different woman, I would like to be able to tell my client, it’s alright to sell that because it’s been held protected but some courts will say, “Well, that’s ridiculous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.904" offset="4196059">It’s a different woman and it’s a different camera angle and it’s a different magazine, so how could the material be protected?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.294" offset="4229601">One of the most beautiful cases in point and it was handed to me by my brother Mr. Cello who will be arguing later as a case of Wisconsin versus Simpson out of the Wisconsin Supreme Court filed October 31, 1972 and in that case, they had, from what I can determine, magazines with nude persons together and nothing more and here is some of the holdings of the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.882" offset="4359899">Incidentally, I had brought it along and now I don’t seem to be able to find it in the recent article, the most recent edition of the New York Magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.037" offset="4424579">There’s a little cartoon that shows two gentlemen in black robes strolling along and one of them is saying, “If it turns me on, it’s smut.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.333" offset="4469718">So, that’s about what happened with the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.653" offset="4482988">Here’s what they say, described magazines are not, as a matter of law, not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.697" offset="4503155">This was the contention raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.110" offset="4512872">Appellant argues that these magazines cannot be found obscene because only nudity is depicted and not sexual activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.712" offset="4543279">Given non-obscenity for non-sexuality are just -- argues appellant, these complaints are not sufficient because they do not allege obscene depictions of sexual activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.427" offset="4586120">Supportive of this proposition, appellants asserts several Redrup reversals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.073" offset="4608690">And certain language in State versus Amato they go down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.417" offset="4622064">This Court, in Court versus State resoundingly rejected the contention therein presented that this Court is bound by the decisions in other Courts regarding whether similar magazines are obscene or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.699" offset="4675145">And he puts in quotes, “The subjective nature of the material as well as the subjective conduct of the respective defendant requires an individual analysis in each case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.845" offset="4719762">A complete rejection by the Wisconsin Supreme Court of what this Court said in Redrup that certain material is protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.875" offset="4759886">They say, “We’ll tell you whether or not it’s protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.856" offset="4775769">We’ll tell you whether or not we viscerally have that feeling.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.882" offset="4791965">Another example, of the type of reaction you get from the lower courts, the question is, was the introduction of the magazines in the evidence without further evidence sufficient to prove their obscenity beyond the reasonable doubt?</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.080" offset="4868765">And they say, this Court has repeatedly held that obscenity is not so illusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.153" offset="4889036">The concept is to require expert testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.303" offset="4901575">There’s nothing here that warrants any further consideration of that question and the evidence in the form of the magazines themselves was clearly sufficient to prove obscenity beyond the reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.408" offset="4945983">You know how this case went to trial</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.362" offset="4953819">?They took the magazines and threw them into the jury and said, “This is what the man is selling.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.027" offset="4976494">And remember these are magazines of a man and a woman in nude and that’s all they’re doing and the Court is saying, “We will ignore everything and we’re going to go our own way.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1264.308" offset="5161650">I was continuing my saga for which this Court is very familiar with a case where there were 20,000 rolls of films seized in Southern California and the District Courts held they couldn’t be seized, it was unlawful and Judge Hanson of the Superior Court said, who I knew in effect and it went to the Court of Appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.766" offset="5239495">Judge Hanson was never held in contempt, of course, because judges are immune from that sort of thing and it went through three or four or five respective courts, finally came up to this Court which affirmed the District Court three-judge ruling and finally, when the films got back after five or six months of the most extraordinary waste of time, in my opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.848" offset="5327788">Getting back to the initial premise of my argument, can’t we give a defendant in a pornography case the same due process of law that you give with a juvenile or that you give a parolee?</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.989" offset="5376376">Can’t he have a hearing such as you said in Morrissey?</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.359" offset="5393826">Can’t he have the same presumption of innocence that is to say in Winship?</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.588" offset="5422770">You said due process says that each element of the offense must be proved by competent evidence beyond the reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.928" offset="5460072">Well, we have three elements of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.180" offset="5469163">We actually have four.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.045" offset="5476582">They were stated in this Court in Roth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.712" offset="5487240">They were stated in Memoirs and it was just recently approved by this Court in Rabe versus Washington which approved Roth and Memoirs as to the three elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.862" offset="5523811">The three elements are very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.354" offset="5533842">Does it go beyond contemporary standards as appeal to the prurient interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.495" offset="5550352">Is it utterly without socially redeeming value?</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.218" offset="5561219">Doesn’t the prosecution have the burden of proving those elements, First Amendment elements beyond the reasonable doubt under the Fourteenth Amendment, so that defendant can have a hearing and a trial on it and don’t they have to present evidence, competent evidence?</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.447" offset="5622136">I say that due process as they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.821" offset="5631645">The fourth element is even more illusive and that’s the scienter element.</text>

            <text syncTime="1724.756" offset="7003387">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.136" offset="7016970">With respect to the in rem proceedings, I would suggest that it is not the answer for as Mr. Justice Brennan has suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.708" offset="7047272">It doesn’t solve the questions raised by the pandering concept enunciated by this Court and adopted in California by statute nor does it take into consideration the definition which this Court has given to obscenity namely that to be obscene, it must -- we must apply contemporary standards or customary limits of candor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.915" offset="7144030">As I suggested last January, the case was argued before this Court, contemporary standards, if they are contemporary, they’re going to change maybe from day-to-day, certainly from month-to-month or year-to-year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.251" offset="7201395">And we’re going to have to constantly reexamine that same book to see whether or not it’s obscene applying contemporary standards, not the standard that was applied six months ago when the hearing was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.552" offset="7266597">With respect to the knowledge that is necessary, I suggest that the only knowledge necessary is knowledge as to what is in the book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.094" offset="7312781">To require that the person disseminating the material must know that the material is obscene would be to totally insulate the distribution of this type of material from any sort of criminal prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1826.036" offset="7408494">That might be an argument against a particular conclusion of non-obscenity be binding on the State where the same material was involved later but what about the argument that in any event before there should be any criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.062" offset="7464605">There ought to be a judicial determination of obscenity or no obscenity before that proceeding continues.</text>

            <text syncTime="1955.777" offset="7927495">That is to say, is it protected in the constitutional sense as a matter of law and if not, then the person is going to stand on trial but merely treated as we would any other case, hold the trial and then that the conclusion of the trial and review, determine whether or not there’s sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction beyond a reasonable doubt and to moral certainty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3097.439" offset="12494117">It seems to be glossed over on occasion or completely eliminated but if the phrase is to have meeting then the redeeming aspect of utterly without redeeming social importance must be emphasized.</text>

            <text syncTime="3135.086" offset="12644791">I would ask that the Court reject the necessity of determining obscenity in a constitutional sense on a piece-by-piece basis and adopt a sufficiency of the evidence test as hide in other cases.</text>
