            <label>Mr. Ernest J. Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="43.893" offset="249292">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.466" offset="267578">This case, on certiorari to the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.603" offset="284087">brings to the Court for the first time since it was enacted as part of the Revenue Act of 1928, what is now Section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.131" offset="338213">That provision is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.856" offset="353155">In any case of two or more organizations, trades or businesses owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same entities, the Secretary Office delegates, the Commissioner as I phrase it, to distribute a portion or allocate gross income, deductions, credits or allowances between or among such organizations, trades or businesses if he determines that such distribution, apportionment or allocation is necessary in order to prevent evasion of taxes or clearly to reflect the income of any such organizations, trades or businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.097" offset="530056">This provision of course expresses the judgment that autonomous business units will exercise self interest and bargaining power which will cause income and outlays to reflect the performance or function and the acquisition of benefits in accordance with the values of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.293" offset="638830">But on the other hand, when we have units under common control, a host of factors which may or may not include tax considerations, may distort this picture and cause considerable divergence between income, expenditures on the one hand and performance or function or the acquisition of benefits on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.134" offset="758262">So that the regulations have always provided since -- as they provide now since 1934 that the authority given account is not solely or even necessarily primarily to cases of improper accounting or fraudulent, colorable or sham transactions or a device designed to evade or avoid taxes, but the authority extends to any case in which by inadvertence or design, taxable income, in whole or in part of the controlled tax payer is other than it would have been had the taxpayer in the conduct vist to ask, been an uncontrolled taxpayer, dealing at arm's length with another uncontrolled taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.266" offset="954807">To bring performance or function and taxable income into life to create what some Courts have referred as economic reality, the Commissioner may and often has found it necessary to analyze pricing, charges, of their services, distribution of receipts or the bearing of burdens of expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.479" offset="1067656">In this case, the Commissioner found it necessary to allocate to the taxpayer banks a substantial part, some 40% of the premium income received by a -- like insurance company under common control for the years 1954 through 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.131" offset="1158249">His allocation was upheld by the Tax Court, relying on its previous review decision in Local Finance Corporation, a decision which thereafter had been affirmed by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.079" offset="1218017">In the Local Finance Corporation decision, the Tax Court had reviewed extensive and reference was made in this case in the Tax Court to those findings, had reviewed extensively the nature and customs of the business of credit insurance which is much involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.089" offset="1298056">The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, however, reversed the Tax Court, disagreeing with the Seventh Circuit in Local Finance.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.479" offset="1331597">Because of this conflict and because the significance of Section 482 increases as business aggregates grow not only larger, but more varied in their nature, we have more and more cases where a business aggregate includes corporations that are subject to methods of taxation other than the normal, barring the corporations, Western Hemisphere Trade Corporations and life insurance companies as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.363" offset="1467120">For those reasons, the Government sought certiorari which this Court granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.437" offset="1495437">The facts giving rise to the controversy are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.997" offset="1513723">The taxpayers are two national banks; First Security Bank of Utah and First Security Bank of Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.051" offset="1549876">They are holding on subsidiaries of First Security Corporation, a publicly owned Holding company, which owns a number of other corporations as well, including First Security Company or Management Company which I would refer as Management Company to avoid confusion, Smith and Sons, an insurance agency and beginning in 1954, First Security Life, an insurance company incorporated in that year which is a -- that one is prime activist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.842" offset="1717060">We should go back to 1948 at the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.702" offset="1736495">Beginning then and since that time, the banks have offered to their borrowers, Credit Life Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.129" offset="1774216">This is diminishing term, Life insurance under which in case of the death of the borrower, his death will be paid to the creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.273" offset="1838791">The Premium charged throughout en banc all here are concerned was $1.00, per hundred per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.390" offset="1875258">This has been the usual and standard right in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.294" offset="1894902">This premium, though apparently it sounds small, permits generous commissions to be paid to the person who sells the insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.714" offset="1936593">It has been customary in the industry to pay commissions in the neighborhood of 50% of the premiums.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="476.057" offset="1977971">Is that on each year's premium?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ernest J. Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="478.275" offset="1986748">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.521" offset="1991764">They are often paid in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.208" offset="1998556">This is usually measured by the time of the death.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.683" offset="2012453">If the death is said to be repaid in three years, then a single premium will be collected at the outset to cover the three-year death.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.060" offset="2057906">So that the --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="496.825" offset="2061040">And the commission approximates 50% of all the premiums over the period?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ernest_j_brown" startTime="499.463" stopTime="809.277">
            <label>Mr. Ernest J. Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="499.463" offset="2071594">50% of the premium, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.642" offset="2092283">It is possible and in many cases it happens that a Credit Life Insurance Company will issue a policy directly to the borrower and he will be the policy holder in holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.101" offset="2146095">However, in these cases or in this case as demonstrated by the exhibits in the record, the banks followed another procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.928" offset="2193429">They took out group life insurance policies, beginning 1948 or each bank took out a group life insurance policy, covering the lives of their borrowers who qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.491" offset="2259676">In 1948, this was with the Credit Life Insurance Company of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.293" offset="2282872">In 1953, this was changed to another group policy with the American Banker's Life Insurance Company of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.189" offset="2322474">So that the procedure that was followed was when a borrower came to the bank, his loan was approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.678" offset="2352358">The loan officer, we are told made available, informed him or offered, the record of course does not repeat the conversations, but hard selling and the soft selling and then this interest in selling, both sides were interested and we do not suggest that it makes a difference whether this was pressed or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.389" offset="2447235">In any event, Credit Life Insurance was offered or made available to the borrower, as necessary, it was explained to him, ultimately it is desired.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.115" offset="2494151">If he was interested, he was given by the bank an application form to fill out.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.097" offset="2522049">There are copies in the record, they are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.995" offset="2533648">The qualifications are, minute, you have to be under 65 and yes, some other minor matters, but this is a sample form, the borrower interested filled it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.353" offset="2579101">It was then examined by a bank employee and if satisfactory, the premium was collected or added to the amount of his loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.217" offset="2626539">The bank employee then made out and delivered to the borrower a certificate of insurance and there are copies of those in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.435" offset="2687457">Well, they are numbered exhibits and I assume that they can be accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.416" offset="2703339">It is another very simple document.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.943" offset="2713475">It is important I think that at this time the insurance was effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.368" offset="2739179">If the borrower had been killed in traffic on the way home from the bank, he was insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.628" offset="2768227">His loan would be paid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.874" offset="2789230">The insurance companies which issued these group policies to the banks received the commissions, well, I should go back a step.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.197" offset="2842520">When the bank had issued this certificate to the borrower, it turned over the premium and the papers involved to the Management Company which made appropriate records and then forwarded the premium and the appropriate records to the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.909" offset="2929351">The insurance company, both Credit Life of Ohio and American Bankers of Florida remitted generous commissions varying from -- between 1948 and 1954, from 40 to 55 % of the premiums involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.054" offset="3009912">These were paid to Smith and Sons, the insurance agent subsidiary though it had nothing to do at all with either selling or perfecting the insurance that had been done by the bank and their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.377" offset="3087235">Oddly enough and for reasons which an Executive Vice President of Treasury of the Management Company testified, he could not recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.962" offset="3133524">These commissions were not included in the taxable income of the insurance agency or of the bank, but of the Management Company and the testimony as I say just a blank, the Vice President of the Treasury said I just cannot remember why it was done that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.335" offset="3207085">In any event this was the procedure that went on from 1948, until 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.768" offset="3240730">Late in 1953 the American National Insurance Company of Texas approached the holding company with a new plan, a slight variant on the O.</text>

            <text syncTime="843.412" offset="3447307">As you know there is very little graduation in corporate rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.972" offset="3465592">The banks, the Management Company and the insurance agency, none as a loss corporation in that way so that -- I suppose except for a purist, it made no great difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.403" offset="3523271">There was no revenue difference necessary that might have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.485" offset="3539676">I cannot say because I have not the returns before me that for all those six years the -- all of the corporations possibly involved were in the roughly 50% bracket rather than in the roughly 22% bracket.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.152" offset="3602265">But we will accept these were prosperous corporations and I think it is highly probable that it may be.</text>

            <text syncTime="1035.869" offset="4217187">So, it suggested that for 8 (b), it would supply accounting services, some record keeping, the insurance company record keeping, actuarial services.</text>

            <text syncTime="1187.246" offset="4822706">The taxpayers and perhaps properly, I do not think we have to ask the Court for a decision on that banking question, the taxpayers read that statute or part of that statute because this is one of the curious aspects as though it said banks in small towns and only banks in small towns, they do the following things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.351" offset="4907133">They have been stressed the thing, the Section that says, banks may receive commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.141" offset="4938271">They do not mention the fact that the statute also says that banks may collect premiums and sell insurance in that generally.</text>

            <text syncTime="1272.508" offset="5163760">Your Honors as I was pointing out, beginning in 1954 the banks remitted premiums to American National.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.409" offset="5203362">It kept some 13.5 % of those premiums for its fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.771" offset="5224782">The remaining 86.5 were remitted to Security Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.377" offset="5251218">This business was very profitable for Security Life with a net worth of $37,500.00 at the outset in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.056" offset="5289880">By the end of 1959 it had a net worth of $850,000.00 and it paid a $389,000.00 dividend so in five years with a capitalization on original net worth of $37,500.00, it had profits after reserves and after expenses of a $1,200,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.036" offset="5389876">The Commissioner allocated 40% of the premiums then to the banks on the theory that the banks had performed the services which resulted in the insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.881" offset="5437210">They had effectuated the insurance and that the market demonstrated that commissions of a minimum 40% were allocable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1368.599" offset="5548074">The taxpayers make the point that and they have repeated frequently in their briefs that the banks could not receive these commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.540" offset="5587885">And as I was pointing out in answer to Justice Douglas’ question, Justice White suggested, this is considerably more complicated than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.421" offset="5631352">The only statute is when it permits banks in small towns to engage in general insurance agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.835" offset="5661027">The Comptroller of the Currency believes and has ruled that this type of transaction is perfectly proper for banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.874" offset="5697181">However, the Fifth Circuit has enjoined banks from participating in just this type of transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.088" offset="5726020">It is interesting that the Fifth Circuit and there is a substantial question of standing as the suit was brought by insurance agents, the Fifth Circuit ruled, surveying a fairly lengthy statutory history and more of what Congress had failed to do than what it had done that there was an inhibition on the banks and that this was to protect insurance agencies to avoid competition by banks with insurance agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.421" offset="5839391">Well, I think it is clear that what the banks did here ousted an insurance agents of a substantial business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.315" offset="5866977">It is not our point either to exonerate or indict the banks for what they did, but only to describe what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.982" offset="5901667">So even if you take the statute as I suggested earlier that authorizes small town banks to act as agents to sell insurance, to collect premiums and then to receive commissions, it seems to me a peculiarly narrow reading to focus only on the receiving commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.212" offset="5986513">The banks effectuated this insurance and it is not for me to say whether they were insurance --</text>

            <text syncTime="1509.539" offset="6111901">I think under -- if we had been involved in the years before 1954, we would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.784" offset="6136874">As Judge Friendly pointed out, 1961, this Court's decision in Lucas and Earl, Chicago and Joliet Railroad, is as he said, a blunt instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.185" offset="6174386">Usually that is an all or nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.723" offset="6184626">Now, we would not claim that all the payments to the life insurance company were income to the banks because the life insurance company did perform the function of re-insuring these writs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.593" offset="6228093">It was a minimum capital, but it did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.484" offset="6239587">So here, 482 provides for allocation as it often requires analysis of prices, of services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.564" offset="6275950">1961 is the blunter instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.954" offset="6285563">Judge Friendly’s opinion in the Ruben (ph) case which is cited makes a point of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.478" offset="6307610">So we would -- I do not know, I shouldn't say that it's universal, that no Court has ever analyzed a transaction and said part of the income was uncommon to Lucas and Earl, but 482 is the more flexible, and more surgical instrument and it seems appropriate here that that should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.530" offset="6395800">It presumes that their will be no receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.052" offset="6413876">It does not ask the bank to receive the money, but it says the bank is taxable as though it had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.907" offset="6441357">That has been true since Lucas and Earl.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.833" offset="6453060">So that I do not think that makes any difference and I would like to demonstrate this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.035" offset="6469883">I think two simple cases would demonstrate that even if this prohibition on receipt were verbatim in the statute as indeed it was in Local Finance, the Indiana statute was there quite explicit, but two simple cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.258" offset="6534771">The first let us take a public office or a purchasing agent and let us make it federal since it is a federal statute, and some point it is made of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.616" offset="6572178">He is prohibited by a statute, we will say, from receiving any funds or moneys from any person with whom he deals, a person deals with his office customarily and would like more business than he has been to get, approaches him and offers him a substantial sum of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.399" offset="6655248">He says, I cannot take it, the law prohibits it and then he remarks, I have a son in college, he could certainly use some extra money, he is always complaining that he does not have enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.141" offset="6710209">The visitor thinks he understands what has been said and promptly they also check to the son in college who inquires it is proven, and is told to keep it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.167" offset="6754409">Now, I assume that it would be no question, that is income to the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.835" offset="6773008">Let us bring it a step closer to this case, in fact I would say almost identical with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.882" offset="6797249">Instead of the son in college, the purchasing officer says, no I cannot take your money and the conversation goes on and then he indicates he had inherited an orchard a few years back and he had incorporated it, his Farms Incorporated and they sell the produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.689" offset="6876453">The visitor at a little polite in direction says he is interested in inquiring apples and peaches and says I will pay you, I will pay farms incorporated a price which is obviously far above the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.386" offset="6943222">The price is accepted, Farms Incorporated receives the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.610" offset="6964120">I think there could be no question that though the statute prohibits the officer from receiving these funds that 482 would allow the commissioner to allocate that money to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.968" offset="7021589">The Fifth Circuit has had no difficulty where purchasing officers who in such oblique fashion had funds paid to them (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.570" offset="7064012">So that seems to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.758" offset="7076760">I cannot believe the statute is more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.508" offset="7087731">We are not concern with the legality or illegality of the banks whether they skirted the edge of collegiality makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.577" offset="7127960">They performed a valuable economic function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.942" offset="7141439">The commissioner and the Tax Court reviewing him decided that it was highly appropriate that the market value of this function be allocated to the banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.802" offset="7184907">I would like to reserve if I may any such remaining times I have Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3037.273" offset="12222778">The statute says that it will operate where a controlling entity, in this case the holding company, has the power arbitrarily to tamper with the income, understate the income of one of these controlled entities and when the holding company comes in and tampers with the income of this entity in favor of this entity, but it arbitrarily shifts the income then the Commissioner may come in and examine that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.628" offset="12340224">We do not have that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.274" offset="12346807">It's stated in terms of this case the holding company would have to have the right to affect the banks to take the insurance income, but no such right exists because the banks would not operate in violation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.102" offset="12402082">The very fundamental premise upon which Section 482 operates is absent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.526" offset="12423816">There is no control element which can arbitrarily shift income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.284" offset="12438862">The Government’s position dies at the very threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.777" offset="12452760">The second horn upon which Section 482 operates is in Subsection C of Section -- of Regulation Section 1.482 – 1 (c) and it is in the Government’s brief in the appendix and that states the frontiers of the Commissioner’s authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.853" offset="12529142">The very frontiers of his authority are stated in that Regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.367" offset="12543143">The Regulation says something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.146" offset="12550249">The authority of the Commissioner to allocate, to take an action under this Section, and then in effect goes on to say as limited to those situations and this was the key phrase, those situations where the income of the taxpayer would have been different in an uncontrolled situation from that in a controlled situation, Now, if the income or the taxpayer is no different in an uncontrolled situation, how can the Commissioner exercise authority in a controlled situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.662" offset="12680338">That test was applied by the Court of Appeals in this case and not repudiated by the Commissioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.901" offset="12705311">It applies to this case and the answer to it as found by both Courts below is that these national banks in an uncontrolled situation would not receive the type of income which the Commissioner tries to allocate to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3180.988" offset="12797680">Both Your Honor, but since this Court granted certiorari I did not develop any argument on the differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.195" offset="12818474">In Local Finance for instance, all the finance company officers were licensed insurance agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.486" offset="12839685">When they made a loan as licensed insurance agents they want ahead and sold insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.674" offset="12860374">They also solicited it very heavily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.671" offset="12868420">95% of the borrowers in Local Finance took insurance whereas in our case as little as 13% of the mortgage loan customers took insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.868" offset="12901125">The time and effort, the amount of time it cost Local Finance to handle the insurance was much greater and so on, but all of the cases with the sole aberration of Local Finance if it does apply in some way, all of the cases are against the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.018" offset="12961729">May I call the Court’s attention to three rules of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.202" offset="12982523">One is the Short (ph) case, the only applicable present in this area when this taxpayers were trying to fix their affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.710" offset="13012511">We cited in our brief and discussed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.406" offset="13019303">In that case because of OPA Price Regulations, it manufactured, it could not raise prices to its wholly controlled wholesale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.704" offset="13060472">The Commissioner came in and tried to allocate income back and the Tax Court said, we will not tax a taxpayer who neither had the right to receive the income nor received the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.324" offset="13106970">That is precisely on the point of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.903" offset="13117315">The Commissioner himself has recognized this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.969" offset="13129540">In two -- in the current wage price freeze that President Nixon embarked upon last fall the Commissioner in technical information release 1106, issued to the public said that where the public because of strictures of the law under this current wage price freeze, more corporations did not give out dividends and accumulated earnings so that there might be otherwise a violation of Section 531 of the Code that the Commissioner would not come in and exact a penalty tax because the taxpayer was prevented by law from doing something, from distributing the money out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.077" offset="13278020">Commissioner himself has taken the position that he must follow the tendency of the law in other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.917" offset="13297351">The tax law does not operate in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.438" offset="13311457">Congress did not pass the banking law and the tax law to operate independently of one another, but rather to operate in a harmonious cooperative whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.568" offset="13343953">The tag if -- if a rule is going to be established affecting all of the regulated industries of banking and insurance industries, Congress should do it, so that taxpayers could do it prospectively and not be penalized.</text>
