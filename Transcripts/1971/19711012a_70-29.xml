            <text syncTime="63.408" offset="327321">I think whether he misunderstood or not, certainly the Assistant United States Attorney in that Court room had no right to misunderstand and as I will get to further in my argument, he should have had an absolute knowledge that the witness Taliento was testifying before that Jury with an absolute grant of immunity given to him by an Assistant United States Attorney.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="85.193" offset="414465">It carries out a little beyond if in fact, the Assistant United States Attorney did not know and was making the argument in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.975" offset="461590">If then, it is not true, does that weaken your position?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="la_rossa" startTime="103.071" stopTime="226.304">
            <label>Mr. La Rossa</label>
            <text syncTime="103.071" offset="485936">No Sir, I do not believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.040" offset="493877">I think that if our foundation of Constitutional safe guards has to depend upon the fortuitousness of the fact that the Assistant United States Attorney trying a case, and the Assistant United States Attorney who makes the assurances to a particular witnesses one and the same, then we are on rather weak case.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.863" offset="573081">I refer to Judge Palmer’s decision, a District Court decision in the Southern District in New York and application of Kapatos(ph) where he said referring to the Napeu decision, I do not think that an accused right as defined by a Napeu should depend on the fortuitous circumstance, but the District Attorney, you conducts the prosecution and the investigation be one and the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.464" offset="679556">And since I am referring to that Mr. Chief Justice, may I also bring to the Court’s attention, the Hawkins decision from the Fifth Circuit which clearly states basically the same thing and the Circuit Court there at that time, in 1963, decided that at that time, these witnesses so testified the Government must be judged with the knowledge that the testimony was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.646" offset="780284">There is another fact at here too.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.328" offset="786971">If we carefully read the Assistant United States Attorney’s affidavit, wherein he tells us that he made a grant of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.363" offset="819154">He tells us that it was agreed upon between Taliento, his Attorney and he, the Assistant US Attorney, it was understood and he also tells us that this was after conference, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.283" offset="874847">Now, those of us who events on experience in the Federal Court know that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the case agent who handles a particular case, and in this particular case that happened to be Agent Axton, who was a witness of this trial, would be the one who received this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.715" offset="936496">So, not only does the Assistant US Attorney who gave the grant of immunity of the Grand Jury, know about this, but we must assume that Agent Axton and the Federal Bureau of Investigation had the same knowledge.</text>

            <label>Mr. La Rossa</label>
            <text syncTime="232.995" offset="1005668">Well, the affidavits in opposition Mr. Justice Marshall, state that an Assistant US Attorney has no authority to grant immunity and an affidavit from Mr. Hoey suggest that this can not be done and Judge Rio’s decision was based in part on the fact that our Assistant US Attorney has no right to grant immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.870" offset="1085185">But I respectfully submit to this Court that if a hearing was held at that time, I as a former Assistant US Attorney in that District could have testified as could any Assistant in that office, that grants of immunity were made in the regular course, to get a witness to cooperate with the Government.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="1545.338" offset="6255027">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.644" offset="6292225">I think the petitioner began by giving very selective view of the facts of this case, thought I think that now, most of facts are out on the table as basis of the questioning in the last five or 10 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.338" offset="6383027">I would like to take the petitioner’s contentions in this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.121" offset="6402148">First, the petitioner contends that the Government witness Taliento lied and truly what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.053" offset="6433913">He did not tell the truth to the Court, and that the Government knowing that he did not tell the truth failed to correct, and the petitioner also urges that the case was in some way shaky anyway with this Taliento was the only witness for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.723" offset="6512594">I want to start with that second point first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.997" offset="6521685">I think it should already be clear to the Court that Taliento did not lie at all in this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.282" offset="6562749">I think when the Court granted Certiorari in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.540" offset="6579781">It may have been under the opinion on the basis of the facts that had been presented to it and the petitioner agreed that there had actually been perjury committed in this case and the Government had failed to correct it that there had been perjury in this case on a substantial issue if Government had failed to correct it, I do not think we would be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.703" offset="6664522">But, there was no perjury in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.302" offset="6674867">What happened was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.530" offset="6687824">That the Grand Jury hearing was two years ago, a week before the case comes up for trial, Mr. Golden begins his preparation for Trial US Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.097" offset="6742054">He contacts the US Attorney who had handled the case and the Grand Jury asks that US Attorney whether any immunity or promises had been given to Mr. Taliento and was informed that Taliento had not been indicted because he was a young man, he was 19 at that time that this happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.375" offset="6839125">That the Government felt that he had been over reached by the older man, Giglio who really can get into this later—set up the whole transaction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="1715.361" offset="6935151">That is correct, that is correct, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.120" offset="6946122">This is from Mr. Golden’s affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.356" offset="6963050">And however, it was also made clear Mr. Golden that it was understood that Taliento would be a witness for the prosecution and that was also a reason he was not being -- that he would not be indited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.210" offset="7018534">Now, with this in mind, Mr. Golden contacted Mr. Taliento, the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.178" offset="7038387">Mr. Taliento told Mr. Golden that he would not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.687" offset="7056464">Now, if there had been any agreement before hand and we only know of that from an affidavit, two-and-a half years after the event, that if there was any agreement before hand and Mr. Taliento said he would not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.548" offset="7111843">That agreement was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.782" offset="7120829">Now, Mr. Golden asked Mr. Taliento, I would be coming to his office and talk to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.685" offset="7140369">Mr. Taliento came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.097" offset="7146011">He came in with his father and Mr. Taliento’s father said “I would rather have my son alive than have him testify and he is not going to testify in this case”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.401" offset="7195226">Mr. Golden then set up a meeting with Mr. Darienzo who had been Taliento’s Lawyer at the time of the Grand Jury proceedings and who was still Taliento’s Lawyer, Mr. Darienzo, Taliento’s father and as Mr. Hoey, the US Attorney himself to come to the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.238" offset="7274638">And, they had several meetings on discussing this point with the Lawyer -- everyone involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.783" offset="7312777">The result of these meetings was that whatever had been done before was made perfectly clear to Mr. Taliento that if he did not testify, he could still be indited and prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.678" offset="7368366">And, Mr. Hoey said to him, he should have been and could be still prosecuted if he would not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.451" offset="7399504">It was also made clear to him in the presence of his Lawyer that if did testify and here I think, I would like to quote Mr. Hoey’s affidavit at page 144A said “Mr. Darienzo did not claim that his client Robert Taliento received immunity or was made any promises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.663" offset="7492291">No assurances were given to Mr. Darienzo or to the Taliento’s except that they would have to rely on the good judgment and conscience of the Government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.468" offset="7527504">So, here is Mr. Taliento, the witness for the Government, going into trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.502" offset="7551641">It was perfectly obvious to everyone he had not yet been indited.</text>

            <text syncTime="1916.399" offset="7739304">I think what it was was something less than a promise, but certainly an indication to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.057" offset="7761874">That if he testified, the likelyhood was that he would not be prosecuted and Mr. Taliento testified that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.073" offset="7801998">He was questioned as to whether anyone had made an absolute promise to him, they would not be prosecuted, and he said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.505" offset="7831673">But if you read -- if you read his testimony, he made it pretty clear that he understood, that he would likely not to be prosecuted, but no one had tended down kite for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.808" offset="7876917">You know, this was not a SEC registration, this was a scared witness testifying in a trial, being cross examined, and I submit that if the Court knows about the meetings that took placed before this Trial and then reasons this to Taliento’s testimony, all Mr. Taliento was doing was reflecting what Mr. Hoey had said to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1976.778" offset="7980780">No, what bothers me as a matter of the facts and that is what you are now discussing is that the witness Taliento on cross examination said this, he said “Nobody told me, I would not be prosecuted”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.874" offset="8045146">In any order of Mr. DiPaola’s affidavit and he says, “If you have actually testified as a witness for the Government, at the Trial of the Defendant Giglio, he would not be prosecuted.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2673.984" offset="10769613">It was just a wholly unfounded argument that Taliento to get himself off the book would try to bring Giglio in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.468" offset="10803572">But the evidence -- there is no evidence today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.444" offset="10815484">And, there is no reason just reading what happened to suspect that that evidence is all the other way around that it was Giglio’s idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.723" offset="10856548">He had set it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.622" offset="10860206">It was not a very great idea and they got caught.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.592" offset="10872013">Taliento instead of being a good solid crook keeping it all to himself talked and the problem was the -- well, the problem with a re-trial in this case that ever came to that is that Taliento was a reluctant witness to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.962" offset="10977548">And he testified and there is no evidence that he testified anyway other than truthfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.495" offset="10999700">The thing that would be bad is that somehow, the pressure got to him and would not testify again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.967" offset="11021538">And instead of being able to get testimony that did correspond with the statements, he made when -- at the time that an un-suspicious time, that we have testimony that would be altered to now try to help his friend.</text>

            <text syncTime="2762.672" offset="11124356">Unless he disappeared, that could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.022" offset="11145776">But I think the crux of the case now say this and sit down unless there are some further questions is that the Jury knew this was the Government’s witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.273" offset="11190811">They knew everything they could know to know that the Government still had a weight hanging over his head.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.850" offset="11229055">If the Government had no weight of hanging over his head, he would have been a freer witness than he was, as things turned out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.053" offset="11261864">Further that Giglio's testimony was within the -- what can be expected of a hostile witness and of a co-conspirator in a criminal trial was honest testimony as to what he had been promised or what he had been promised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.113" offset="11322155">There is simply nothing in this case that raises it to the level cases like Brady versus Maryland and Napue versus Illinois where there was real evidence that might have changed the outcome of this case, and where prosecutor had suppressed it or where there was known perjury that he did not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.093" offset="11406060">This is the kind of case that I believe in which the District Court and the Court of Appeals should have a certain amount of discretion and which this Court should be reluctant to undo with both the District Court and the Court of Appeals, some extent we were closer to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.429" offset="11507415">Both found was correct.</text>
