            <label>Mr. Scott H. Elder</label>
            <text syncTime="56.095" offset="298079">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, I suppose our plea here is really quite simple when you boil everything down.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.234" offset="342591">What’s involved is basically a fleet of vessels navigating the Great Lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.745" offset="364639">These vessels trade throughout some eight separate States in interstate and foreign commerce and two provinces of Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.898" offset="401315">Now we’re involved with a somewhat emotional issue as everyone knows pollution is.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.720" offset="424616">We feel a responsibility to end pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.817" offset="444991">That’s the responsibility of every citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.035" offset="457843">But we also feel that if the abatement of pollution is a valid premise in Michigan, it’s also a valid premise in Ohio, in Wisconsin and Illinois and what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.987" offset="497654">We are willing to put the equipment on the vessels, we are not asking this Court to act as a super legislature and decide what the Pollution Bill rights is or should not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.462" offset="535584">What we feel as a basic concept that once we installed pollution equipment aboard the vessel, whatever that equipment should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.400" offset="571319">We should be able to use it wherever we go.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.172" offset="582395">We have a federal license which authorizes to trade on the Northern and Northeastern Frontier.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.429" offset="603398">Having that federal license, we should then be able to use that pollution device in any port, any waters that we go into.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="139.128" stopTime="147.503">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="139.128" offset="630147">What’s the basis for you saying that Mr. Elder, if the State of Michigan says otherwise, is it the federal statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="scott_h_elder" startTime="147.503" stopTime="260.072">
            <label>Mr. Scott H. Elder</label>
            <text syncTime="147.503" offset="663688">First of all, I think Michigan has exceeded the police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.003" offset="677690">I think that Michigan statute goes beyond the police power because it has extra territorial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.617" offset="700155">Secondly, I think the uniform maritime law play the most important point in this whole case requires that this be treated as a matter of uniformity and not a matter of individual state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.627" offset="744146">Finally, not finally but we do have a Commerce Clause involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.582" offset="763999">There are numerous cases which hold that where a particular function in commerce requires national uniformity, even in the absence of a federal statute then the states have no authority to act because it has to be treated uniformly.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.985" offset="821677">Finally, we do have a question of preemption under the Federal Water Quality Act of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.099" offset="846128">We also feel very strong about that particular issue that this field has been completely preempted by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.516" offset="883744">Now, you take a look at the Act, that is the Federal Act and Congress came out with a comprehensive scheme of pollution control.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.531" offset="919793">It gave the EPA the authority to promulgate standards and figure out just what type of level of treatment you have to have aboard these vessels and this is a nationwide standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.676" offset="968381">Then it gave the coastguard the authority to go ahead and promulgate rules and regulations covering the design of that particular equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.495" offset="995652">And this gets to be very important because that equipment has to fit the vessel and it has to comply with marine safety regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.856" offset="1021148">You have got problems of stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.485" offset="1027626">You have got problems of the integrity as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.824" offset="1037030">So it has to be all taken care of by the coastguard.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.075" offset="1049987">Now, we advocate that this shows a comprehensive overall scheme for pollution control.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.232" offset="1078617">We believe that preempts the States because to let the States go ahead here now.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.370" offset="1099202">Even for a short time completely frustrates the federal program.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="260.072" stopTime="266.799">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="260.072" offset="1113935">Why does it, when the federal regulations don’t become applicable to existing vessels until a future time?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="scott_h_elder" startTime="266.799" stopTime="288.174">
            <label>Mr. Scott H. Elder</label>
            <text syncTime="266.799" offset="1140893">Precisely, for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.323" offset="1151029">If we are to put a holding tank in because of Michigan’s law.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.166" offset="1170359">Presume we got to pump that tank out and if we are in Ohio and Wisconsin, we’ve got no legal remedy, no equitable remedy while we can compel anybody to put on pump-out station and get rid of that stuff.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.628" offset="1224172">So --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="288.174" stopTime="292.208">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="288.174" offset="1226366">Isn’t that a problem which exists regardless of the pending federal regulations?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="scott_h_elder" startTime="292.208" stopTime="371.975">
            <label>Mr. Scott H. Elder</label>
            <text syncTime="292.208" offset="1242562">No, it isn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.162" offset="1246323">No, if we had overall federal regulations, then we can put the equipment in and we would have some leverage somewhere and I assume that when these federal regulations do go in, that the EPA is going to have some authority to control short stages if the solution is pump-out.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.490" offset="1311630">But I think if you look at the Federal Act, you will see that it provides for an effluent standard, meaning that there is a certain overboard discharge to be allowed, this way the ship can function.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.806" offset="1360949">I realize that there were probably certain limited, restricted areas where no overboard discharge will be allowed because of in certain harbors and so forth that type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.108" offset="1410163">But once you do that, make that particular restriction and you put your treatment device aboard the vessel, then when you do have to hold, you can hold the treated effluent not raw sewage and this is what we want to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.221" offset="1466588">Now, we are not objecting to these limited no discharge areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.148" offset="1482261">But we say under the Federal Act, you are allowed to have an effluent go overboard out in the lake and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.338" offset="1510996">And then if we do have to hold and if we do have to store then we are to be holding treated effluent not raw sewage in a great big tank.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.576" offset="1547986">It is the extra territorial effect of the Michigan Act --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="371.975" stopTime="383.512">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="371.975" offset="1561569">You said that we ought to do this and we ought to do that but I mean isn’t that not basically a policy judgment that is up to the judgment of legislature in the first instance rather than of the private carrier?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="scott_h_elder" startTime="383.512" stopTime="403.823">
            <label>Mr. Scott H. Elder</label>
            <text syncTime="383.512" offset="1607754">Definitely, very definitely but the point I’m trying to make is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.289" offset="1622800">I’m not asking this Court to set as a legislature as I indicated before and decide the pollution device.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.610" offset="1648087">We are saying basically this.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.576" offset="1651953">It’s got to be uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.852" offset="1661043">We trade at eight states and two provinces of Canada so let’s make this thing the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.904" offset="1681315">We’ve got to go out and put something on these vessels.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="403.823" stopTime="422.098">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="403.823" offset="1688942">You mean your concern is that the Michigan law specified one form of solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.615" offset="1716110">New York perhaps another, Illinois is still a third and if you are subject only to the federal regulation that then there be a single specification.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.229" offset="1758637">Is that it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="scott_h_elder" startTime="422.098" stopTime="499.930">
            <label>Mr. Scott H. Elder</label>
            <text syncTime="422.098" offset="1762085">That’s a very distinct possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.765" offset="1768772">I mean, if the States can do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.316" offset="1774937">Well, they already have done things completely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.396" offset="1783297">The Wisconsin statute is not the same as the Michigan statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.469" offset="1795522">The New York statute is not the same as the Michigan statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.239" offset="1810673">In fact, actually our vessels are exempt under the New York statute because our vessels are already subject to the interstate quarantine regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.655" offset="1836273">We are already prohibited from federal law from discharging and then briefing my -- out of any specified intake crib on the Great Lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.313" offset="1866888">That is a domestic water intake crib.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.365" offset="1879114">Now, if you just leave one state alone, the problem is you have got to put something on your vessel, it’s a machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.130" offset="1914222">It’s a piece of equipment and then once you’ve done that, you just can’t shut it off.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.980" offset="1937628">You got to be able to use that wherever you go.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.399" offset="1947241">And you go outside in Michigan, you are to be able to use it in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.273" offset="1962810">But now here is another typical example and I’m way off my argument here but anyway let’s look at this.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.089" offset="1990082">Suppose you got a ship going from Duluth to Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.177" offset="2002412">Now it passes down the St. Mary’s River and passes through Michigan waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.584" offset="2015995">But that particular vessel company has no way of compelling the fellow in Duluth to pump in and put in a pump-out station.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.130" offset="2046193">There is no way of compelling the fellow in Chicago to put in a pump-out station yet this ship is supposed to have holding tank and put all the stuff into it.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="499.930" stopTime="509.324">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="499.930" offset="2073360">Well, can’t the ship arrange, the shipping company with its own funds to put in pumping-out station in Duluth or in Chicago?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="scott_h_elder" startTime="509.324" stopTime="516.583">
            <label>Mr. Scott H. Elder</label>
            <text syncTime="509.324" offset="2110977">Well, do you think we can convince Pacino Railroad and Cleveland, Ohio for example to put in a pump-out station?</text>

            <text syncTime="520.924" offset="2157370">No, we are not concerned about the cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.259" offset="2170745">We are not raising the question of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.094" offset="2182030">What we are saying is, we’ll do it, you’ll go ahead and put the devices in but once we do we want to be able to use them wherever we go.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.054" offset="2205853">I don’t think that is an unreasonable device --</text>

            <text syncTime="538.885" offset="2229259">There are no pump-out stations that I know of existence for commercial vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.953" offset="2245455">There are pump-out stations in these little yard places and so forth, where a vessel homes itself so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.935" offset="2277429">But our vessels don’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.364" offset="2283176">Our vessels go all over the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.745" offset="2292684">Now, holding tanks may be a good solution for some vessel that comes in to a particular dock every trip, trades in there every one or two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.353" offset="2323091">This may be the simple and best arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.762" offset="2336779">But it’s the vessel that is coasting all over the lakes and never knows what state it is going to be into next and this really gets down to the fundamental concept of maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.099" offset="2390069">Now, this is more than just a Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.912" offset="2401354">The maritime, uniform maritime law is based on entirely different provision of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.057" offset="2429879">And if you look at the Knickerbocker Ice Company case and the Jensen case, they say that you have got to absolutely have uniformity throughout this maritime business and there they held two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.762" offset="2484737">First of all, that the State of New York could not regulate Longshoreman, that’s why we have the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.609" offset="2520159">Then in Knickerbocker Ice, the Congress turned around and tried to give the authority to the States and this Court said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.412" offset="2555372">This is a Congress of delegated powers, the delegation is from the people to the Congress and the Congress cannot give it back to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.835" offset="2592988">And this is the one area where the States cannot interfere.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.034" offset="2613781">Now, I know that the State of Michigan said, well, the States can regulate pilotage and then there is no interference with the maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.463" offset="2651502">But I think that’s an interesting example because look at what pilotage is.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.064" offset="2673968">Now first of all, pilotage is based essentially on local knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.660" offset="2696328">When the constitution was written, we had a conglomeration of 13 separate States but at that time each of those States had their own pilotage system, within their own pilotage waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.893" offset="2749305">But what happens, pilotage is local, it’s based on local knowledge and it ends at the state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.165" offset="2774382">The pilot gets off the boat.</text>

            <text syncTime="683.328" offset="2806983">So, I think the distinction here is between the full train crew cases and the cases regulating the length of trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.957" offset="2845540">Now, in the full crew cases, the Court noted, this Court that the effect of the statute ends at the state line of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.814" offset="2880962">Extra man in the crew, whatever it is, gets off at the state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.827" offset="2892978">It is simple enough to stop the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.021" offset="2901755">But now, when you start regulating the length of the trains, then there are only two alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.505" offset="2923698">One, is to break up the train at every border and reshuffle your cars but you can’t do this until you got a (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="723.397" offset="2967270">The other alternative is to comply with the very minimum number of cars of any state to which you pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.645" offset="2992243">And this Court specifically held and I am talking about Southern Pacific Company versus Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.584" offset="3011992">This Court specifically held that that gave the state statute based on the police power extra territorial jurisdiction which the police power cannot extend.</text>

            <text syncTime="772.329" offset="3162980">It’s pretty clear that where there is a case pending, a criminal case pending in the state court that this Court feels an abstention is proper unless there is bad faith, harassment through this particular state prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.939" offset="3545412">Now, before we put in this equipment and install it, we disagree that Michigan has the right to require us to put in holding tank.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.406" offset="3579267">Now, this we feel is a very real and right controversy, it means that we’ve got to go out and do something if this Michigan law is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.777" offset="3612808">If it isn’t then we can go the course of the Federal Legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.378" offset="3635169">So there is a real right and ready controversy here and I was quite interested in an opinion here.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.701" offset="3676443">This is a -- Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Marshall in concurring in part and dissenting in part in this case of Perez versus Ledesma decided last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.264" offset="3746764">Citation is 39 Law 4214.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.032" offset="3765781">Now, this Court said in that particular case, that if the state prosecution was first filed and if it arrives an adequate form for the adjudication of constitution rights, the federal court should not ordinarily intervene when however as here at the time of the federal hearing there is no state prosecution to which the Federal Court plaintiff may be relegated for the assertion of his constitutional defenses, the primary reason for refusing intervention is absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.210" offset="3882497">Then it goes on to say but the basic principle that in appropriate circumstances, federal courts will exercise equity power against state officials to protect rights, secured and activities authorized by paramount federal law remains firmly embedded in our jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.469" offset="3959610">Now, more importantly it goes on and says this, citing Terrace versus Thompson, they say that talking about defendants or whatever you want to call the appellants whatever they might be, they are not obligated to take the risk of prosecutions, fines and imprisonment and loss of property in order to secure an adjudication of their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.660" offset="4052292">Finally, it says this, in case of this sort and whatever provision the claim of unconstitutionality rest, the justification for intervention is that individuals should be able to exercise their constitutional rights without running the risks of becoming lawbreakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.235" offset="4122614">The justification applies the full force where there is a continuing life controversy and federal intervention is sought when there is no state prosecution in which the state may be treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.664" offset="4168381">In other words, we don’t feel that we’re lawbreakers and we don’t think that we should have to sit and wait for the suit or the state to sue us before we can get an adjudication of our constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.271" offset="4214774">But, I want to answer this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.867" offset="4221148">Suppose the state did sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.162" offset="4234314">In this particular litigation you have got 19 individual vessels companies as plaintiffs, operating a total of 187 ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.031" offset="4265765">Alright, which one of the 19 is going to be the first guinea pig?</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.115" offset="4282170">And I really have the nerve to go out and try this type of case, the pollution case in a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.876" offset="4309233">Take one step further, each ship is potentially an offender although the state courts have no in rem jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.400" offset="4343297">But, then you have got a 187 potential offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.337" offset="4363045">Take the total number of ships in the Great Lakes and the American Flight, 422.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.484" offset="4379659">Add to those the Canadian vessel, the foreign overseas five vessels and you have got all these possible potential offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.890" offset="4405259">But what has really happened here, actually you’ve taken all these suits and you consolidated here down into one particular lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.224" offset="4438591">Now this is the purpose of the Declaratory Judgments Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.476" offset="4447577">This is what its form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.018" offset="4453742">Actually, you save litigation, you got a form that has taken away the stigma of the criminal proceeding and we can get right down to the substance of deciding the case.</text>
