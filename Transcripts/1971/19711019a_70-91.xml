            <text syncTime="41.138" offset="238186">That issue is whether the right of a serviceman to petition to Federal Court for habeas corpus based on the wrongful, and I claim, of wrongful administrative denial of his applications for discharge as a conscientious objector should be or maybe suspended until he has exhausted certain kinds of military criminal proceedings, which are pending against him at the time the habeas petition is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.155" offset="338287">The issue arises out of the District Court’s order which was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in order that all proceedings on petitioner Parisi’s petition for habeas corpus based on his claim that the Army had denied his conscientious objector discharge application without any basis, in fact, should be staid until exhaustion of military criminal proceedings, which were pending based on the claim of refusal to obey an order to board a plane headed for Vietnam.</text>

            <text syncTime="168.819" offset="748932">The record is lodged in the Court of Military Review, briefs are filed, the case is argued although in this case oral argument has been waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.789" offset="780801">There is a decision and if the decision is adverse to the defendant then I would certainly read the District Court’s order as requiring further exhaustion by an appeal to the Court of Military Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.818" offset="2228926">It is been recognized by many decisions including the recent Ninth Circuit decision in Racher v. McDamera (ph) that even if, for example the Court did not feel that it could direct the immediate release to the petitioner, at the very least he has a right to a hearing and a determination on the merits of his claim and under the Habeas Corpus statute the Court shall then dispose the cases as law and justice required.</text>

            <text syncTime="585.396" offset="2415231">This would be a proceeding in the habeas corpus proceeding, this would be between him, on the one hand it is custodian and on the other hand his custodian would be representative of the Army, I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.129" offset="2466222">The parties being the same would that not be res judicata which would give him (Voice Overlap) to any subsequent Court-Martial proceeding?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard L. Goff</label>
            <text syncTime="605.166" offset="2494330">Yeah, I certainly think that in a subsequent Court-Martial proceeding a strong argument could be made that such a determination was res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.564" offset="2523900">Certainly I think the effect of the District Court, that the District Court were to give him the hearing on the merits and were to make the decision that his application have been denied without any basis in fact and thus in violation of his rights of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.399" offset="2571234">That would be determination that he has a right to discharge as a conscientious objector and I think that a strong argument could be made either for the proposition that he has a right to discharge which deprives the military of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.747" offset="2624628">Indeed the Solicitor General’s own brief seems to concede as much by the reference in the analogy to Army Regulation 635-200, or at least for the more limited proposition which several of the District Courts have been adopting in their discharge orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.241" offset="2678650">But at least he ought to be put in the same position as he would have been in if the Military had granted his application for discharge rather than denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.407" offset="2711250">And this again I think it is something which is recognized by the Government’s own brief, in their Footnote 34 where they point out the distinction between the type of order that the military might give a man even while they are processing him out such as in order to put on a uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.893" offset="2773213">And in those circumstances the Government, the man would not be excuse from disobeying the order and presumably would have to go through the Court-Martial process anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.767" offset="2804769">On the other hand the order which assigns him to some new duty station is an order which clearly the military would not have given him if the Secretary of the Army had granted his application for discharge as a conscientious objector and if the military would not and could not have given him that order then I think it would be quite proper for the District Court to say that the right of discharge shall be recognized now and shall supersede any Court-Martial, pending Court-Martial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.489" offset="2919603">Certainly that is not so surprising in view of the fact that the military itself seems to recognize that such an order would be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.719" offset="2956592">If it was an order which ordered the man to a new duty station and followed or was depended upon a wrongful denial of a conscientious objector application.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.802" offset="2992850">I think that once the District Court has made the basic determination that the military denial of his claim was wrongful without basis in fact and he is entitled for discharge as a conscientious objector, it then certainly has the power to inquire into the legality of the man’s continued detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.911" offset="3065262">Sort of like the basic purpose the writ requiring the jailer to justify the legality of the detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.016" offset="3085742">And in no circumstances if the Government wish to claim that the continued detention was justified by subsequent events then I think the Court could certainly inquire in the validity of that particular claim.</text>
