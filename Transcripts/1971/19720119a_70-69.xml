            <text syncTime="46.552" offset="259924">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.864" offset="277165">This case is on direct appeal from the District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.485" offset="295659">The court dismissed an indictment charging that appellee had transported 82 reels of obscene film interstate by means of a common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.519" offset="335783">The court held that the relevant statutory provision, 18 U.S.C. Section 1462 is on its face constitutionally invalid because it is overbroad in forbidding the use of common carriers for the non-public transportation of obscene material</text>
            <text syncTime="81.957" offset="401507">The government appealed directly to this Court pursuant to the old Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.615" offset="420107">Like Reidel and Thirty-Seven Photographs and the case just argued, this case arises from an expansive interpretation of Stanley versus Georgia by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.699" offset="460440">Precise issue in this case, is the constitutionality of the statute that prohibits the knowing use of a common carrier for the interstate transportation of obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.861" offset="505161">We believe that Reidel and Thirty-Seven Photographs have effectively settled the issues raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.812" offset="528881">Indeed, the judge who decided this case has subsequently sustained the constitutionality of this section after those cases were handed down.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.273" offset="562735">That is not cited in our briefs and the citation to that case is United States versus Zacher 332 F. Supp. 833.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="132.476" offset="603591">833?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="r_kent_greenawalt" startTime="133.281" stopTime="483.004">
            <label>Mr. R. Kent Greenawalt</label>
            <text syncTime="133.281" offset="606830">833, yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.185" offset="618428">In trying to evade the clear import of Reidel and Thirty-Seven Photographs, appellee makes two different arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.484" offset="647581">One is that even when transportation is for the purpose of sale, Congress cannot prohibit the use of common carriers to transport obscene materials interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.080" offset="690004">The second argument assumes that commercial transportation maybe forbidden, but contends that the statute is invalid as it applies to non-commercial transportation and that this impermissible overbreadth renders the entire section invalid on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.895" offset="753220">It is the government's position that the statute is constitutional in both its commercial and non-commercial applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.766" offset="780701">If however, it is considered unconstitutional in some or all non-commercial applications, it is our position that the statute should not be declared invalid on its face, but limited to its permissible application.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.002" offset="841723">I turn first to the argument that even transportation for sale is constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.726" offset="868577">In Reidel, as Court refused to recognize a constitutional right to distribute or sell obscene materials and reiterated the principle of Roth that obscenity and its distribution are outside the reach of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.595" offset="924061">In Thirty-Seven Photographs, six justices squarely held that importation of obscenity for commercial distribution is not constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.010" offset="961677">Appellee concedes that the First Amendment would not protect the commercial distributor of obscene materials who wishes to import such materials or send them through the mails, but he argues that the same commercial distributor who wishes to transport materials in interstate commerce is constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.741" offset="1036596">Congress' plenary power to prohibit not just materials from flowing in interstate commerce, has long been a cornerstone of this Court's interpretation of the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.654" offset="1076303">In Gibbons versus Ogden, the Court said that Congress' power over commerce among the states is vested, “as absolutely as it would be in a single government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="261.301" offset="1118830">And in the lottery cases as well as many others, it has sustained absolute prohibitions against items of commerce judged harmful.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.703" offset="1148505">In Hope versus United States which is cited in our briefs, where the Court sustained the White Slave Traffic Act, the Court assumed the constitutionality of these provisions and used those as a premise to reach the result in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.581" offset="1207960">Congress' powers over commerce are of course, limited by the First Amendment, but the First Amendment is also relevant to what Congress can preclude from the mails or forbid from being imported.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.602" offset="1256130">Appellee cites a number of cases for the proposition that the government has special powers over mail because it operates the postal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.254" offset="1286641">But in this First Amendment context at least, these cases have no authority after Blount versus Rizzi and Lamont versus Postmaster General.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.671" offset="1324361">The government can no more exclude protected materials from the mail on the basis of their content, but it can exclude them from commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.171" offset="1354350">And conversely if commercial distribution of obscenity through the mails can be prohibited, so also can any sort of transportation in interstate commerce for commercial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.825" offset="1408998">Assuming that Congress may validly prohibit the use of common carriers traveling interstate for the commercial distribution of obscene materials, the order of the District Court in this case should be reversed either if transportation for personal use may also be prohibited or if invalidity as to transportation for personal use does not require striking down the entire section.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.439" offset="1503457">We believe the statute is constitutional in it's non-commercial as well it's the commercial applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.471" offset="1531565">But I consider the overbreadth point first because we believe it's clearly controlled by Thirty-Seven Photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.234" offset="1558627">First, I would like to clear up what seems to be an issue from appellee's brief, but is not really an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.618" offset="1588094">We do contend that it is inappropriate to hold this section invalid on its face, but we do not contend that appellee lacks standing to make that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.945" offset="1629472">Appellee does have standing to make the claim that invalidity in some applications renders the section invalid for all applications, whether or not he is a commercial distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.282" offset="1674820">If on the other hand, as we contend, invalidity in some applications would not render the statute invalid as to all applications, then the District Court could determine in subsequent proceedings in this case, the purpose of the transportation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.244" offset="1742634">In neither of that is this Court required to determine appellee's purpose from this record, so that really is not an issue at this point in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.826" offset="1784952">In Thirty-Seven Photographs, the same six Justices who held that importation for commercial purposes could be prohibited, also held that the District Court in that case was wrong to strike down the entire section in its application to commercial importation because importation for personal use might be constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.631" offset="1872201">Mr. Justice White's majority in plurality opinion said, “the proper approach was not to invalidate the section in its entirety, but to construe it narrowly and hold it valid in its application to Luros” and Justices Harlan and Stewart concurred on the same ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.979" offset="1941583">As these opinions indicate, a holding of facial invalidity for overbreadth is not appropriate when a statute can be clearly narrowed to constitutional applications in a way that will eliminate virtually all of the possible chilling effect on protected communication.</text>

            <text syncTime="509.692" offset="2112423">That is correct.</text>

          <turn speaker="r_kent_greenawalt" startTime="514.962" stopTime="659.167">
            <label>Mr. R. Kent Greenawalt</label>
            <text syncTime="514.962" offset="2133530">That is right, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.280" offset="2146801">As far as the overbreadth point is concerned, the language of Section 1462 involved in this case is virtually indistinguishable from the language of Section 1305 (a) involved in Thirty-Seven Photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.864" offset="2201135">Section 1462 involved here forbids the use of common carriers to transport obscenity interstate without respect to purpose, just as Section 1305 (a) that provided forfeiture for importation of obscene material without respect to purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.996" offset="2281697">Section 1462 dates back to 1897 and it is the primary prohibition against interstate transport of obscene materials in the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.772" offset="2324747">It is clear that Congress would prefer this section sustained in its valid applications rather than being declared invalid on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.607" offset="2360064">And this case does not involve the kind of interrelated set of administrative provisions such as were present in Blount versus Rizzi and Freedman versus Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.870" offset="2397158">In those kinds of cases, the Court declines to rewrite an administrative setup that defines certain provisions constitutionally invalid, but here we have a straightforward criminal statute that can be validly applied in certain applications and plainly the lower court erred in striking down the entire section on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.145" offset="2482213">We believe the court also erred in quite a different respect by deciding that interstate transportation of obscenity for personal use could not constitutionally be proscribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.042" offset="2529860">We now get back to territory that's been covered in the previous argument to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.354" offset="2551072">Reidel and Thirty-Seven Photographs made clear as had Roth that obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment and congressional power to decide what goods may cross state lines extends to this unprotected material.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.904" offset="2605302">What the plurality said in Thirty-Seven Photographs with respect to foreign commerce, a passage that the Solicitor General read to you in his argument, “Obscene materials may be removed from the channels of commerce even though intended solely for private use is equally true of interstate commerce.”</text>
            <text syncTime="651.630" offset="2680221">The majority opinion in Stanley versus Georgia indicates that the government may not invade a person's home to ascertain if he possesses forbidden material.</text>

            <text syncTime="659.167" offset="2710314">I take it what you are saying there that if Mr. Stanely for example wanted to give the materials involved in the Stanley case to someone else, he would be violating the statute if he sent it through the mails, but he could get in his car and drive from wherever he lived to some other place and deliver it to a friend as a gift?</text>

            <text syncTime="691.255" offset="2838732">This section covers only transportation by common carrier and 1465 would be the relevant federal section for that, I think that in terms of transportation for sale or distribution, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.572" offset="2891917">Now then I suppose you have a nice statutory question as to whether if you give a book to a friend, that's distribution or not, within the terms of the statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="928.358" offset="3787081">And I have mentioned that state legislatures may forbid constitutionally unprotected material from being sold, but that other states may permit their sales such as Oregon has chosen to do and that if the federal government is powerless to stop transportation across the state lines, citizens of a state that forbids the purchase of pornography can circumvent that policy of that state by buying material in a more permissive jurisdiction and bringing it back to their own state.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.710" offset="3904528">More significant perhaps in terms of actual impact on prosecutions is the fact that if only commercial transportation maybe stopped, it may sometimes be difficult to prove a commercial motive although that is the real reason for the transportation and I remind you of the Solicitor General's argument about the difficulties of drawing that particular line.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.610" offset="3992090">Also, in this situation, a holding of constitutional protection of private transportation would cast a jeopardy, scores of convictions under 1462 where transportation was in fact for commercial purposes, but in which the jury determination of guilt of course, did not require a finding to that effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1090.868" offset="4437112">But it is our contention that there is no constitutional bar to set the prosecution because Section 1462 is patently constitutional as to use of common carriers to transport obscenity for sale and both because its coverage of transportation for personal use is also constitutional and because the proper approach, if the section is unconstitutional in some applications is to limit the section rather than invalidate it on its face, the order of the district court in this case should be reversed and the indictment should be reinstated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1273.229" offset="5166556">Stanley was not actually viewing obscene film at the time the officers arrived with a search warrant, Stanley was merely possessing them with the intent at some future date to view them, just as the man on the airplane, whether in his pocket or in his luggage is possessing the material with an intent at some future time to privately enjoy his collection of erotica.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.693" offset="5276479">Similarly it's no extension of Stanley to protect the possession in his suitcase on the airplane.</text>

            <text syncTime="1384.695" offset="5612414">1462 permits such persons to be prosecuted and flies directly in the mandate of family.</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.393" offset="5999235">I view Thirty-Seven Photographs not only as pure private possessory transportation, but as a case in which Mr. Luros asked the affirmative assistance of the government in bringing this material into the country, and perhaps the distinction can be drawn between he who imports privately and seeks to have some government customs agent authorize his importation than the man who seeks nothing from the government and merely seeks to go to his hunting lodge in Utah.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.300" offset="6618859">What this Court would be doing would be adding an additional element to the offense which was enacted by Congress in Section 1462 of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.475" offset="6671522">The distinctions of course between what the appellee asserts you cannot do in this case and you did do in Thirty-Seven Photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.789" offset="6716871">Alright, but number one, Thirty-Seven Photographs is not a criminal proceeding, it's a civil forfeiture proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.551" offset="6747904">Secondly, you don't have the same kind of severability clause to work with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.117" offset="6774131">The severability clause which applies to Title 19 permits the Court to severe out unconstitutional applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.210" offset="6814464">The severability clause which is appended to Title 18 as we recite in our yellow brief does not permit the severing out of unconstitutional applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.087" offset="6858036">It's a different kind of severability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.417" offset="6871307">Perhaps more important is the matter that we touched on tangentially in our brief and now I would like to elaborate on it in more detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.053" offset="6917909">The Court will recall that in its opinion in Blount versus Rizzi, the issue was raised as to whether or not the legislation there could not be saved by a construction which would provide for judicial review and this Court noted that that was what the Post Master sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.609" offset="6988126">He sought to avoid precisely that, and so the court wasn't free to impose a constitutional meaning on the section there involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.060" offset="7033893">In this case, this isn't a case in which Congress in Section 1462 never considered the commercial applications of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.205" offset="7074539">When this statute was first enacted in 1897, the final clause which prohibits one who takes from a common carrier obscene material, was limited to commercial distribution and it was in that statute that it said whoever takes from a common carrier with the intent to sell, distribute, or circulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.712" offset="7168476">That was the way the Act was in 1897, that was the way it was reenacted in 1905, and when it went into the 1907, 1908, 1909 general revision of the penal laws, the joint committee, the joint committee of the Senate and House which reported it out, reported it out changed from the earlier statute in two material respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.188" offset="7274428">The first respect, the committee added to the first clause, the importation clause that it must be for the purpose of disposing of the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.472" offset="7311522">That importation would not be unlawful unless it was for the purpose of disposing, and retained in the final clause this with intent to sell, distribute, or circulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.890" offset="7357184">When it came to the floor and was reported out on the floor of the house, Congressman Houston amended the Senate proposal, the joint proposal by striking both of those provisions and 1462 for practical purposes appears now at least as far as this aspect is concerned as it was amended by Congressman Houston of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.014" offset="7449762">But Congress on at least three occasions and probably four if you consider the predecessor bill that was passed by the Senate and not by the House, on four occasions has addressed itself to whether this statute should be limited to commercial activity and on at least three occasions, and it said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.544" offset="7539832">So I think that in the face of that kind of legislative history, we can't distort the language of a statute, we can't add an additional element to this offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.352" offset="7595107">We can't indict individuals or offenses which were not enacted by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.945" offset="7637426">The construction which would narrow 1462 to commercial applications would pose all sorts of problems of truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.705" offset="7696463">As the Solicitor General pointed out in his previous argument, as my friend pointed out in this argument, to limit the construction would impose an unreasonable burden on the government in how you go about proving that it was for commercial purposes and will the self-proving declarations of defendants be sufficient to defeat a prosecution further, should this Court then enact some sort of presumption as appears in 1465 to make proof easier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.045" offset="7833867">1465 is of interest by its terms would apply also to transportation by common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.929" offset="7865423">The legislative history of 1465 suggests that it was to fill the loophole and to permit prosecution of private carriers, but certainly nothing in the language of the statute is that restrictive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.506" offset="7911712">So would this Court then enact a presumption so that if you had five or more copies of a magazine or two copies of one magazine and three of another, then this is presumptive evidence for the commercial purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.862" offset="7961135">Also, I submit that the statutes which are enacted, most of the statutes, which are enacted which prohibit some form of transportation of something around the country from one state to another.</text>

            <text syncTime="2064.065" offset="8329880">The indictment in Zacher is identical to the indictment in this case, that is that both Zacher and Orito were charged with the same transportation at the same time and the same place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.958" offset="8381498">It appears they were both on the same airplane, it's difficult to determinate whose luggage it was, that appears to be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.976" offset="8409605">As far as Judge Gordon's opinion is concerned, Judge Gordon misses the thrust of our argument and to be perfectly fair, this argument was never made to Judge Gordon, this concept of possessory transportation, it wasn't necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.103" offset="8490063">It wasn't necessary that it'd be elaborated in the detail in which I presented to you for it was not necessary that he thread his way to Reidel and Luros, Reidel and Thirty-Seven Photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.389" offset="8563205">I think that Judge Gordon misconceives the thrust of our argument, although we did not argue Zacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.697" offset="8600508">He misconceives the thrust of in it that we are not asking that this Court or that court extend Stanley one iota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.823" offset="8636975">Zacher and Orito were engaged in a private possessory transportation, and Stanley protects those who privately possess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.804" offset="8680861">Neither of them were distributing, no inference of distributing can be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.931" offset="8705416">Their activity is protected by the First and Ninth Amendments. As we thread our way through Reidel and Thirty-Seven Photographs, we note, but do not rely upon the fact that those who ship or carry on common carriers in interstate commerce obscene material do not seek the affirmative intervention of our government for their enterprise, for their private enjoyment of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.801" offset="8864867">It maybe that the government and this Court can hold that if you wish to enjoy obscenity in the privacy of your home or the privacy of your railroad car, that's alright, but don't ask us to help you with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.686" offset="8936443">That is don't seek the affirmative assistance of the government in permitting you to enjoy your sordid reading habits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.400" offset="8979284">I submit that on that basis some distinction can be drawn between Reidel, Thirty-Seven Photographs, Gable versus Jenkins which in a sense there the defendants -- plaintiffs in that case, there they sought the two acquired derivative rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.843" offset="9097044">They sought to take Stanley and say that because Stanley has the right to read, we have the right to sell to him, because Stanley has the right to possess, we have the right to deliver.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.101" offset="9154095">The court made short script to that argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2283.926" offset="9209370">We place ourselves squarely within Stanley, we claim that those who possess obscene material as long as they possess it in a way in which it is unlikely that it will be exposed to unwilling adults or exposed to children or placed in front of an unwilling public, as they long as they privately possess it in an area in which there is reasonable expectation of privacy, then they are protected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2413.334" offset="9727013">What I find is the basic problem here is that 1462 extends to purely private possessory transportation and the statute from its legislative history, from the words that are used, from the fact that it was amended at the same time, that 1465 was enacted that Congress was perfectly aware of the problems of private possessory transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.773" offset="9832756">That the statute can't be construed such as to emasculate the clear congressional intent that it was intended to apply to what this court has held to be protected.</text>

            <text syncTime="2491.039" offset="10037870">I don't think this issue was raised by this case, but I think that what may seem to be the troublesome hypothetical of someone who carries in his pocket one obscene book, there is I think a question as to whether the statute that covers that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.752" offset="10104639">The language in the statute reported in the 1955 revision I believe was deposit with the common carrier and the change in language was designed to extend the venue of provision so that people could be prosecuted at jurisdictions which they travel through as well as the place that they had put the materials on the carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.233" offset="10190634">So I think there might be an argument that use of a common carrier doesn't cover that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2669.097" offset="10750072">So you say that the statute wouldn't be invalidated by Stanley if it authorized seizure of an allegedly obscene material in the mail is addressed to a user and would have Stanley rights if he ever got it inside his house?</text>

            <label>Mr. R. Kent Greenawalt</label>
            <text syncTime="2687.329" offset="10823006">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.732" offset="10832619">In other words, if you set off a book company asking them to send you something, and it was sent to you, we don't think there would been a constitutional bar to constitute the purchaser as well the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.494" offset="10883610">On the severability point, I'd like to suggest the language of United States versus Jackson 390 US 570, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Stewart, at footnote on page 585, he says -- the Court said, whatever relevance in such an explicit clause may have in creating a presumption of severability, the ultimate determination of severability will rarely turn the presence or absence of such a clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.516" offset="10995728">We think it's clear that whatever this specific language of the severability provision, basically the question is trying to ascertain congressional intent as to what --the remainder of the statute preserved or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.300" offset="11054869">Finally, as to the legislative history that's been suggested there seems to me the major defect with the argument as has been made is that the conclusion doesn't follow up on the premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.326" offset="11102934">It is clearly true that Congress does mean to cover non-commercial transportation, but it does not follow from that; but if it has to have only commercial transportation or nothing at all, that it would choose nothing at all and that really is the question here on the overbreadth point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.100" offset="11166046">I might mention that because I think in the sense this supports another point we were making that this provision, well first of all, the original 1897 statute did not, if you deposited the material in the common carrier, there was no requirement of wanting to sell it or distribute it, it was only the person who took the material from the common carrier that had the limit that my brother has mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.059" offset="11257893">So that is relevant to receiver, not to the person who deposited the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.923" offset="11281403">Secondly, in 1909 when this change was made, a similar change was made as to Section 1461 and the congressional record in the House indicates that the reason that the change was made was because it was very difficult to prove the element that was required in showing the purpose of a person who was receiving the material from the common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.446" offset="11387460">So that the words were eliminated to eliminate a difficult element of proof and I think that supports our argument that to draw that constitutional distinction does create a difficult element of proof which Congress has not wished to impose and which is not required by any of this Court's decision.</text>
