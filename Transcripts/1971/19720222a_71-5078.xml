            <text syncTime="544.550" offset="2251919">It provides for jury trial in criminal cases Your Honor and of course the defendant may weight it in all criminal cases both misdemeanor and felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.422" offset="2319315">In considering this issue of course, I think the Court recognizes that the black man acknowledge that he can complain, and the State seems to rely on some concept of prejudice as needing to be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.415" offset="2399354">It is the position of the petitioner that in fact there is prejudice to the petitioner, and that that prejudice comes from the essence of the requirement of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.558" offset="2463929">What the jury means.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.668" offset="2472393">I think this Court has talked about the value of the cross-section in Duncan versus Louisiana and has talked about it in Williams versus Florida, and I think there, the fact that there must be between the Government and the defendant, the voice of the people has been recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.547" offset="2563821">I submit to you that one of the consideration should be that is the voice of all of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.350" offset="2587123">Now, how there is prejudice is a more speculative matter?</text>
            <text syncTime="637.766" offset="2624739">It is speculative in that you have to analyze what a jury trial in fact amounts to and how the minds of respective jurors worked but I would suggest to the Court that in fact there is prejudice when the broad base of the jury is destroyed in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.472" offset="2711570">The jury stands as the barrier against the various vices that it can occur in the jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.292" offset="2742812">Now, those may be improper acts of conduct by a prosecutor, hopefully not but improper acts of by statute -- by a judge, or improper acts by a juror, a particular juror such as someone attempting to influence the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.640" offset="2836226">In addition to those factors that the jury stands as a buffer between there’s the question of the nature of the crime and how that particular crime affects a particular jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.127" offset="2886172">All the standing of the defendant, his particular status in reference to the community that it is about to try, or the status of the victim, or the status of the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.988" offset="2949598">The concept that I submit to you that the defendant in fact is prejudiced is that as to those possible violations and those possible acts that depart from what we say is the right to a fair jury that the broader the base, the more likely who there is that they will not be the influence of any of those things to such an extent is to deny the fairness of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.842" offset="3073000">So, I think the very concept of what the provision for trial by jury means is that we try to strive toward the system that will get us the fairest possible result.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.569" offset="3135903">So, we say that --</text>

            <text syncTime="778.250" offset="3186685">That that is the closest you can come to justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.454" offset="3195462">Now, we are not talking about the standpoint of what one side of the other wants in the jury, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.017" offset="3221689">But as to those things, the broad base amount to insurance in reference to the ability of the jury to withstand any number of unfair prejudice issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.406" offset="3279263">So as to that very basis that I submit to you that the concept that seems to have been the basis of the opinion below that there was no prejudice to this man is it not or to a white person complaining the exclusion of blacks is an error that there in fact is a prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.629" offset="3352197">And of course, in speaking of the language that is been used by the Court’s, there is a narrowing of attitudes, some of these distinct flavor of the jury is lost, and you can also consider of course that the whole is different from the parts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.256" offset="6086695">I ask the Court to consider in reference to this, the possibility that could occur if there are juries in the State of Georgia and other States that are invalidly composed and I would suggest to the Court that this type, discrimination does still in fact exist and does occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.655" offset="6168301">I wish to give illustration outside the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.844" offset="6185020">Shortly before coming here three weeks ago in a town some 60 miles south of Atlanta, the Superior Court Judge declared invalid the jury list upon an application by a black in a rape case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.695" offset="6244474">In response to that, the three white jury commissioners resigned in protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.260" offset="6278747">Now, that issue had not been raised, have not been pursued in that Court until 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.540" offset="6307795">What the reason for that is, is that in your rural areas where -- if there is type of discrimination that carries over into the system, the lawyers generally are few, are engaged in a more local practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.797" offset="6364847">They fight the evidentiary questions in the Court, but it is not as likely that the constitutional concepts are litigated or fought and it is brought out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.218" offset="6406538">So, the fact there will be a beneficial effect of this type of decision is illustrated by the fact that these prejudices can in fact occur and continue eventhough the system that was used in this particular case has been rejected.</text>

            <text syncTime="1875.592" offset="7576092">But, that is neither here nor there when you get down to the course of action and as a matter of fact that very fact the he relied so heavily on the exhaustion as giving you and that’s where the standing issue came and as a matter of fact, he said he had standing because he had, didn’t have to exhaust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.850" offset="7641085">He had a justification for none exhausting so he had standing to come into court, and that is how that issue got in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1909.272" offset="7710780">But I think the fact, the exhaustion question is important because it illustrates that he did not pursue the due process claim in the courts below, and this is the answer to a question that Mr. Justice White asked appellant’s counsel and I think it is very important to recognize that because this whole thing arose us an equal protection claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.583" offset="7803985">The petitioner in his petition in the court -- in the District Court talked in terms of systematic exclusion and Fourteenth Amendment and equal protection and just briefly mentioned the words due process and we do not think that that raise as a due process argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.001" offset="7881725">And he says, I do not have to go to the Georgia Supreme Court because they’ve already ruled that I can’t raise the systematic exclusion issue, and systematic exclusion has always been regarded as an equal protection concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.089" offset="7945986">This Court said so and why this?</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.939" offset="7953405">And in the case is preceding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.885" offset="7961242">It is in the terms of equal protection concept that we looked at the systematic exclusion allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.358" offset="7995096">And by him, now coming at this point and say, well now, I want to pursue this idea of due process which I just mentioned the two words in the court below and in the District Court, I don't think he has raised that properly because he didn’t argue it in the court below and that’s exactly what he used as the basis for not going through the Georgia’s State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.752" offset="8104706">So, he indicates to me that he did not intent to raise a due process argument because he there states, he has a new right which is never been recognized before which is a right to a representative cross-section of the community period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.457" offset="8167505">He eliminates the part that makes it a equal protection claim which is a right to a representative cross-section of the community from which members of his race where not excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.174" offset="8218391">And that’s the concept -- that's the context in which that phrase has been used in all the cases that I have been able to find since Strauder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.097" offset="8266038">As a matter of fact, I think that the concept arose in the Smith case in 1900 or rather 1940.</text>

            <text syncTime="2554.573" offset="10291991">I think that’s one of the points that was made in Fay that when you are talking about a constitutional right, that is a distinction as to when you are claiming a statutory violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.821" offset="10332951">If it is a statutory violation, there’s no question as to whether there is harm or not that’s already been decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="2576.229" offset="10378613">And I think one of the best analogies that I came across was the decision in Witherspoon and particularly since it was followed by the Bumper case of the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.185" offset="10438381">There was also a procedure which it was found, a part of criminal proceedings which were found to be in violation of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.793" offset="10476834">And that was the questioning that was used in death penalty cases or at least capital felony cases when the death penalty was a possibility, and it was found out question that made the jury prone towards giving a death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.832" offset="10561052">But the Court did go so far as to say, therefore, we are going to eliminate his whole conviction because there was no connection between the questioning which had to do with the sentence and the conviction, the concept of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.577" offset="10635972">So since he could not show any harm even though this was an unconstitutional questioning system that was being used, since it did not affect him, we’re not going to overturn his conviction, and that happens specifically in the Bumper case where although the questions where used, he had got a life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.340" offset="10715070">So it didn’t matter to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3204.084" offset="12890025">And therefore, we are not going to overturn his plea because it didn’t -- the use of the statute in that case didn’t harm him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3252.737" offset="13084585">And I think, that’s where they fall short.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.133" offset="13094198">If we talked about whether there should be a cross section, the idea is to make sure that we have an impartial jury and that we have a fair criminal proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="3318.296" offset="13346855">I think, there is vast distinction here because this arises under the Federal Habeas Corpus Act and under the theory of Federal Habeas Corpus or habeas corpus generally, a person would be challenging his own conviction and saying that he was denied his own constitutional rights by virtue of something that happened that his trial or afterwards whereas Strauder of course being the removal statute case involved something else entirely in its context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.960" offset="13465555">Moreover, Strauder too was Negro in that case and the opinion does talk to a great extent about prejudice that devolved to him which we don’t have in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.765" offset="13512785">He is not -- Peters is not a person aggrieved by what he claims was not proper in that sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3369.588" offset="13552073">Unless you take the position suggested by my brother Douglas that a constitutional definition of a jury is a jury selected under a system which does not discriminate and that every man, every criminal defendant has a due process right to be tried by a jury selected under such an none discriminatory system.</text>

            <text syncTime="3388.507" offset="13627723">Yes, it would be then an abstract principle which has not been held for the application of constitutional rights to others in other context I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.312" offset="13662936">And I think an answer to that I would quote from the Fay case which Mr. Justice Douglas mentioned in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.203" offset="13694492">“The defendants have shown no intentional and purposeful exclusion of any class, and they have shown none that was prejudicial to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.052" offset="13725839">They had had a fair trial and no reason appears why they should escape its results.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.056" offset="13745901">To reverse the judgment free from intrinsic infirmity and perhaps to put in question other judgments based on verdicts that resulted from the same method of selecting juries reminds too much of burning the bond or to roast the pig.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.211" offset="13806505">And I think we have that same situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.022" offset="13817790">As in Fay so in Peters, the challenge to this judgment under the Due Process Clause must stand a fall on a showing that these defendants have had a trial so unfair as to amount to a taking of their liberty without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.689" offset="13872438">And I think on this record, we would find that he does not allege anything more than that he was a white person.</text>

            <text syncTime="3476.060" offset="13977869">I wish to urge that this Court take the position and declare that one of the fundamental concepts of the trial by jury is the right of all citizens to a representative cross-section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.978" offset="14037637">And we take issue with the statement that this jury from which blacks where excluded, favored the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.098" offset="14082045">That is to assume that it had a bias of some sort and assuming, you can say that it was a white bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.789" offset="14112869">We say all juries should be absent, white bias or other type of bias, and that that is the fundamental issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.173" offset="14158323">In commenting upon what has been the status of the law which to quote in conclusion from Justice Wisdom in Labat v. Bennett where he quoted from Shakespeare’s Measure for Measure and that is that “The law have not been dead, though it has been asleep.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.355" offset="14239093">We ask you to wake it up as it relates to the right of a representative cross-section.</text>
