            <label>Mr. John J. O’toole</label>
            <text syncTime="60.397" offset="315297">In 1963, 75th General Assembly of the State of Illinois revamped our entire bail procedure, and they did this for two-fold reasons and the main and the most important one was to assure that all persons regardless of their financial status would not be unnecessarily detained a waiting trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.624" offset="408189">As an ancillary blessing of the system we have practically eliminated the Bondsman System in the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.480" offset="439536">Basically, what this legislation did was to enable a person accused of a crime to gain his pretrial freedom in one of the three manners, under 110-2 he could make an application for release on his recognizance, under 110-8 he could post the full amount of the bond, I mean the bail set by the court in either cash, stocks, bonds or real estate in double the value, or he could deposit 10% of the full amount of bail under 110-7 and all of this was very good and has been very effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.860" offset="601077">But in doing so, they put in one anachronism and that is they impose a cost on the individuals who are released under 110-7, those that make a deposit of 10% of the full amount of bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.485" offset="667637">In this case, John Schilb and all those other similarly situate sought and received their release under 110-7 and they were all charged a 10% bail cost upon their release or conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.225" offset="738586">Now we contend that this imposition of a cost on this one segment is unconstitutional for all of the people involved here seek one end and that is to be released so they could prepare for trial and not to be subject to pretrial incarceration, yet they impose the burden of supporting the entire system on one segment of that class.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.878" offset="961149">So, just across the board statute I do not think would solve our judges --</text>

            <text syncTime="266.161" offset="1138259">But in addition to that, we also contend that these people who put up the 10% simply cannot afford the full amount of bail and they are penalized in their quest for justice in contrary to the long line of cases since Griffin versus Illinois.</text>

            <text syncTime="1088.790" offset="4428852">This was recognized by our former Chief Justice in a speech before the National Bail Conference also, that when it comes to bail, the question of poverty is a relative concept.</text>

            <text syncTime="1180.836" offset="4796969">I think that the best way to understand why the Illinois 10% deposit provisions are constitutional to take a look at what we had in Illinois before they were passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.728" offset="4836571">Prior to 1963, when the whole bail procedure in Illinois was overhauled, we had two ways of getting out of the jail once bailed had been set.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.683" offset="4880352">First of all, you had a release on recognizance which was not utilized, that was perhaps cured, perhaps not cured if the release on recognizance is doubled in Illinois since the bail reform statute went through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.296" offset="4934896">It has doubled.</text>

            <text syncTime="1217.796" offset="4944822">The number released on recognizance has double and it is still not an extremely large percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.752" offset="4964675">But we still have to release on recognizance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.616" offset="4980140">The only other way you can get out prior to 1963 was either to have yourself or somebody else for you pledge the full amount of the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.157" offset="5018279">Now because you have to pledge the full amount of the bond, there were defacto three categories of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.823" offset="5048999">There were the rich who could put up the full amount of the bond, there were those who could not put up the full amount of the bond but could go to the bondsman to pay his fee and get out that way, and then there were who really -- the truly indigent who just did not have the money even to go to the bondsman, they have to stay in jail, attending the trial of their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.523" offset="5135725">Now, I think there is a difference of opinion as to the purposes of 110-7, the 10% bail deposit provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.865" offset="5185149">They were, first of all, designed to get rid of the bail Bondsman in Illinois.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.166" offset="5306357">The other purpose of the Bail Reform Act 110-7 was to reduce the financial imposition on those who had to go to the Bail Bondsman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.170" offset="5350347">Now, the reason why to get rid of the bail bondsman is fairly obvious, they have been the villains for all the legal journals over the last 20 year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.374" offset="5387128">There were all sorts of abuses including some scandals that unfortunately involved judges and the Assistant State Attorneys in Cook County and throughout the State of Illinois but that does not mean that bail bondsman should still be around just because we had judges and Assistant States attorneys involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.273" offset="5454733">The big problem was that, by statute in Illinois, a bail bondsman could charge 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.043" offset="5485870">Now, that was suppose to be the maximum limit that bail bondsman could charge but unfortunately in things like this, that became the minimum and it finally got to the place where the bail bondsman, not the judge, held accused to the jail in many cases because if you are unable to post the full amount of the bond and you want to go to see the bail bondsman, the bail bondsman will take a look at you and you will decide whether or not you are a good risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.315" offset="5590883">If you are not at good risk, the price went up and so 10% was the beginning of the bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.482" offset="5619617">Now other scandals that involved the bail bondsman having judgments vacated and not returning the pledges to the defendants, and of course the way they got the defendants back to the courtroom if the bond had been jumped was notorious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.755" offset="5692656">So, what the Illinois legislature wanted to do is first of all, get rid of the bail bondsman, second of all, make it a little bit less expensive for those who are not exercising a constitutional right but exercising really statutory right to get out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.383" offset="5763186">When you went to the bail bondsman, you put down the amount of your bail, excuse me, the 10% with him, the statutory amount and then the bail bondsman all he did was was sign a bond, he did not have to put down any money because he had money down in his bank, that is the way it worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.996" offset="5817626">But when you put down that 10%, that is the less you saw that -- no matter whether you were innocent, not-guilty, you forfeited 10% of the amount of your bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.524" offset="5863810">Now, I think a question was asked, where do we get the 10% and the 1%?</text>

            <text syncTime="2620.254" offset="10554670">And I would like to point out that there was no allegation in this that anybody was indigent, there is no motion for reduction of bond, there is no motion for Release on Recognizance and if the case is here and the plaintiff in this case is really sewing on the head of indigent people, we do not know really anything about him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2798.622" offset="11268127">It came from the fact that they got 1% on forfeitures from bondsmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.062" offset="11297906">Today, they equate very close to that 1% on forfeitures and bail jumping where people deposit 10% and they deposit the full amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.577" offset="12611970">About 2% are released on their own own recognizance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.089" offset="12625972">Now what benefit or why would somebody who has to full post the full amount, because he has the ability to post treasury bills, stocks, bonds, any type of security representing an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.508" offset="12687725">He can pledge for his freedom and leave that asset in tact and earn interest while we are imposing a cost here, we are allowing this person to continue making money on his investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.096" offset="12742060">And here he sees about it, the person who was released are allowed to see the benefit, the 10% person receives the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.172" offset="12770377">Well, why should a system insist that one segment of those who are released on bond support that entire system and when there is not even a need for it because the same bond forfeitures that existed prior to the Act exist today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.057" offset="12841848">This is actually a fiscal policy of increasing the revenues and that is all it is.</text>
