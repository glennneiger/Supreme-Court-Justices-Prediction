            <label>Mr. Albert E. Jenner, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="5.769" offset="96734">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.581" offset="116064">I apologize, I seem to suffered a cold overnight and I may have a little problem with my voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.791" offset="156815">I was concluding yesterday, I was reciting the facts applicable here regarding primarily upon the question of whether, not only whether the Emerson had inside information but whether it was humanly possible for Emerson to obtain inside information, let alone abuse the inside information if they have obtained any.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.741" offset="260678">I reached the point in which I had stated to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.658" offset="272277">This appears in my record.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.166" offset="282308">That when Emerson made a counter merger offer to meet Reliance’s and Dodge’s merger offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.896" offset="337269">Emerson then launched into a proxy contest to solicit proxies to double purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.777" offset="372796">For the purpose of defeating the proposed merger of Dodge into Reliance at the special circle this meeting that had been called and also to obtain proxies for the purpose of obtaining a special meeting to require the Dodge Board of Directors to submit to Dodge, stockholders the counter-merger offer of Emerson which Emerson claimed was a superior offer by way of merger for the shareholders of Dodge as against the Reliance offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.160" offset="522321">In the meantime, as all of you will realize regardless of this case, these proceeding served the benefit of the shareholders of Dodge very much because the tender offer at $18.25 above the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.223" offset="602569">Reliance’s, Dodge’s proposed merger, at still a higher figure in the way of shares, I remember that as convertible shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.952" offset="641544">And that Emerson coming back with another proposed merger of Dodge in to Emerson, that is still a higher figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.694" offset="668502">The market price for the Dodge shares has kept going up and up and up.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.089" offset="690027">This had nothing to do with an inside information but as this is typical many times and most of the time of tender offers that the market price of shares of the target company tends to rise very materially.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.495" offset="751676">First, because the tender offer is always at a higher price than the market at the time it is -- the tender offer is submitted otherwise, it would not be effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.290" offset="790859">And the counter-merger by way of it -- to defeat a tender offer, likewise raises this price of stock because the merger proposal is always at a still figure or it would be not be attractive.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.763" offset="860763">It appeared to Mr. McRoberts, the general counsel of Emerson, at this point, that is at the point that Emerson began to solicit proxies to defeat the merger of Dodge into Reliance and to bring about consideration by shareholders of the Emerson offer of merger of Dodge into Emerson.</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert E. Jenner, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="219.733" offset="952610">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.985" offset="957625">The tender offer shares were purchased on the 16th of June, so this came after that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.292" offset="986882">You are right with that Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.531" offset="1003810">Mr. McRoberts then wrote the letter that my Brother Mulligan complains about, I think what that somewhat (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="245.569" offset="1055950">And that appears commencing at page 36 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.949" offset="1073504">And what was Mr. McRoberts’ concern about?</text>
            <text syncTime="255.241" offset="1094611">He was concerned about first this, that under the cases that had been decided up to that time, Stella and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.458" offset="1131496">That if the merger of Dodge into Reliance was approved at the special shareholders meeting called for the 22nd of August, that the receipt by Emerson of the conferrable preferred shares of Reliance, the surviving company in exchange for the 155,000 shares of Dodge that Emerson had acquired by way of the tender offer on June 16th.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.108" offset="1254167">We constitute a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.170" offset="1270363">And if constituting a sale would under the cases then bring Emerson within at that point, 16(b), and it would require Emerson then to pay to Reliance, the difference in value gained over the price paid for the tender offer shares which was $63.00 a share and the value of the convertible preferred received in the merger of Dodge into Emerson.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.473" offset="1419575">And he so says, as Your Honors will note, in his letter of opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.263" offset="1442771">Now it is true that in his letter of opinion where he cautioned Emerson about this fact that they were going to -- that they had the danger of being involuntarily held to have made a sale of the tender offer shares by virtue of the fact that the merger of Dodge into Reliance had come about by approval of the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.861" offset="1557188">And then subsequent approval of the Board of Directors because under the Indiana statute, the approval of the shareholders of a merger does not consummate that merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.666" offset="1596371">The Board of Directors must under the Indiana statute approve it and then it becomes consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.330" offset="1626987">So he said, in his letter of opinion, this constitutes a danger and -- you should begin to prepare yourself to see if you can avoid that had a cosmic result where the Time company has been preventing you from obtaining information, preventing you reaching its shareholders and doing everything it can to lock you out and to cut off all communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.588" offset="1752061">Still you are running to the ironical situation because of this mechanical simplistic statute that you may be involuntarily come within it and you will notice that at page 36, he does recite those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.953" offset="1821547">But he did anticipate also the possibility, Your Honors, as my Brother Mulligan had said to Your Honors yesterday that perhaps they could sell if they wish or desire or needed to sale the tender offer shares acquired in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.474" offset="1891555">But there was at that time, if Your Honors please, no, they had been no negotiations with Reliance on that score.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.665" offset="1932306">Reliance was resisting us and Dodge was resisting us.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.055" offset="1949965">There had been no offer to purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.024" offset="1961772">There had been -- we have not undertaken a negotiator sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.057" offset="1981939">Counsel Wesmick (ph) Roberts was advising his client, you are in danger.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.189" offset="2006494">And Mr. Chief Justice, when you asked Mr. Mulligan yesterday what was the only way?</text>
            <text syncTime="489.759" offset="2032721">What was the way you could -- that Emerson, you are out of this situation and Mr. Mulligan responded to you, well all they had to do was wait until six months or six months and one day from the tender offer purchase date, June 16th, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.058" offset="2109939">But that was not so because Mr. Mulligan overlooks the fact which Mr. McRoberts did appreciate and that is the danger that when the Dodge – Reliance merger should it be approved by the shareholders and then by the Board of Directors that that would constitute a sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.190" offset="2186425">And Mr. McRoberts’ judgment will happen to be right on that score because the Newmark case came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.923" offset="2221429">Not long after that in which the Second Circuit so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.235" offset="2242641">Now Mr. --</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="620.646" offset="2556319">What was that difference made?</text>
            <text syncTime="623.089" offset="2566037">They realized some $900,000.00 of profits, is that reflected increase?</text>

          <turn speaker="albert_e_jenner_jr" startTime="627.177" stopTime="896.552">
            <label>Mr. Albert E. Jenner, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="627.177" offset="2582442">Well, the difference is -- first we offered $63.00, that was $18.25 above the market and then the Dodge -- Reliance securities were estimated to be at a value of around $76.00 to $80.00 a share.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.245" offset="2678677">And the Emerson management touted that they had even higher figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.355" offset="2707098">I do not mean to use the word touted in any -- depreciatingly fashioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.077" offset="2733952">But there was a difference in value and more important if Your Honor pleases, the shares to be received in the merger of Dodge into Reliance were convertible preferred shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.701" offset="2784525">So at that would give Emerson another option it would write on the preferred until -- if the market would be -- of the common came offered would be propitious for it to exercise that option.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.565" offset="2843979">So it was pretty clear that what Emerson would receive had it gone through and waited till beyond the consummation of the merger would necessarily come within what the cases were then holding and which Newmark -- in the Second Circuit Newmark did subsequently hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.486" offset="2919630">So at that point, the man that is one of Emersons receiving this opinion of its counsel became concerned naturally.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.764" offset="2976786">They still thought they had the chance of defeating the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.451" offset="2991519">And being successful on the proxy side, so that is what I have -- but the point I want to emphasize is.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.927" offset="3017433">It is unlike Mr. Mulligan’s representation to Your Honors yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.223" offset="3042615">He used the word scheme that on the advise of its counsel, the management of Emerson’s scheme to try and avoid the harsh results of 16 (b) by reducing by one sale, the percentage of its shares in Dodge from 13.2 to 9.96.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.004" offset="3181690">Now, if the advise of counsel, reading the authorities, subsequent confirmed in his urge constitutes a scheme in the sense that it is invidious and odious, where we are going with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.154" offset="3254311">But it was advise of counsel and if Section 16 (b) is to construed by this Court that if -- because counsel advises the client of a problem and suggests a possible solution of it that that is a plan or scheme for which the client is to be punished, then I respectfully suggest to Your Honors that lawyers in this country will have some pause into giving advise to clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.872" offset="3397148">Now, you will notice that Mr. McRoberts’ advise to his client, that sell off enough of your shares to get down below the 10% and then you may undertake of the 9.6% remainder provided as he says in his opinion that two steps are not legally tied together.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.884" offset="3553256">And both the District Court and the Court of Appeals did find that the two sales were not legally tied together.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.035" offset="3585857">That is they were separate and distinct sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.100" offset="3602053">The first sale of the 3.2% was to Goldman Sachs separately negotiated at no time up to that point had there been any talk with Reliance whatsoever about its possibly purchasing shares.</text>

            <text syncTime="1486.312" offset="6018902">What did Congress intend when it said, and I will read through the section, this subsection shall not be construed, not be construed by any Court to cover any transaction where such beneficial owner, that is an owner of 10% or more was not, was not such, that is the holder of 10% or more both at the time of the purchase and sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="1530.041" offset="6193818">Now, that is what Congress said and I respectfully submit to Your Honors that what both the SEC in this case and what my Brother Mulligan is urging upon Your Honors is to rewrite the exemption provision of 16 (b) as Congress ruled it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.226" offset="6262572">It is an artificial, for the whole 16 (b) is artificial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.939" offset="6381482">But beneficial owner is described in 16 (a) as being merely an owner of 10% or more, information which may have been obtained by such beneficial owner by reason of his relationship to the issuer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.290" offset="6446892">That is plain simple common English and that is what Congress intended.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.855" offset="6721073">When we filed our brief that case was not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.525" offset="6743748">This is as parallel a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.691" offset="6756495">When we were in law school, we talked about the Cow (ph) cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.021" offset="6777811">So this is a Cow (ph) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.539" offset="6787842">This involved Kern County Land Company and Occidental Petroleum. Occidental Petroleum started out negotiating for a merger of Kern County Land into Occidental petroleum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.506" offset="6843744">Just as Emerson negotiated with Dodge to -- for a gentleman’s agreement merger of Dodge into Emerson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.922" offset="6877390">That failed as did the Emerson situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.016" offset="6889720">When the negations failed Occidental made a tender offer to the shareholders of Kern County Land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.575" offset="6927963">At 20 dollars the above the market, ours was 18 above the market, Kern reacted just as Dodge reacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.526" offset="6971849">Kern went to Tenneco and arranged a defensive merger of Kern into Tenneco -- the mechanism was to organize a new company and merge both Companies in to the new company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.616" offset="7044156">But the effect was the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.825" offset="7053037">This person stocked up in value, as to the stock went in value here in Dodge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.013" offset="7077697">Now also Kern resisted, just as Dodge resisted to all kinds of injunction suits and the sort of thing that we had a hearing, which I was so unsuccessful in the Northern District of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.576" offset="7151989">Successful only on one if I got to stockholder's list.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.416" offset="7167349">And defeated in an injunction but the defensive merger came along then that was in exchange of shares, that is convertible preferred for the shares of Kern County land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.380" offset="7227222">Now, how did Occidental meet this problem as judge, Chief Judge Finley says there was the danger of the merger going through and then Occidental under the cases this Court had decided, that is the Second Circuit that that would have constituted a sale by Occidental of the shares of Kern County Land it had obtained on this tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.945" offset="7353446">Now the way they sought to solve the problem instead of as I -- because the figures were so greater, millions and millions of dollars involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.064" offset="7393988">Their counsel resorted to an option.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.718" offset="7412587">That is an option to the new Kern County Land, new company land coming in to existence to purchase the tender offer shares, one day after the six month period and that was attacked as they device scheme says my Brother Mulligan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.903" offset="7513315">And Chief Judge Finley for a unanimous Court holds otherwise and follows and refers directly to both your opinion Chief Justice Burger and yours as well Justice Stewart as justifying the right to use a solid option provision to avoid not evade but to avoid the harshness of 16 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.719" offset="7636613">So the case is very parallel to this and Chief Judge Finley said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.897" offset="7697322">Some decisions of this Court reflect at least in the dictum, they believe that this principle should be applied across the board even to situations that Congress scarcely considered the high water mark of this rather simplistic approach was the statement in Park &amp; Tilford Inc. versus Schulte, skipping the citation the case of the sale of common stock within six months of an economically compelled conversion of long held preferred in Decoma (ph).</text>

            <text syncTime="1951.104" offset="7878089">That was what Chief Judge Finley says, it is a simplistic approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.231" offset="7898569">However, that mechanistic view did not long persist even in our own Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.757" offset="7920721">See Roberts versus Seetan (ph), certiorari denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.255" offset="7934722">Then he says a revolt against it elsewhere was begun by the opinion of Judge Stewart as he then was in Ferraiolo versus Newman, citing it which was later followed by the Ninth Circuit in Blau versus Max Factor which was so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.549" offset="8007865">The problem was then given thorough consideration in the Blau case and then by this Court in the Blau case that versus the Lehman brothers.</text>
