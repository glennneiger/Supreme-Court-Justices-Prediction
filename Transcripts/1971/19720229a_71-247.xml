            <label>Mr. William L. Dwyer</label>
            <text syncTime="34.030" offset="209770">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.431" offset="227428">In this case, the courts of the State of Washington have declared themselves to be not bound by this Court's constitutional definition of obscenity and they have thrust to decide to publish a man criminally for exhibiting a motion picture which is clearly non-obscene and is protected under the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.168" offset="330351">In the course of doing this, the courts of the State of Washington have welded a general obscenity statute of the type which typically exists in all 50 states and of the type which this Court has repeatedly made clear, can be used only to punish or suppress material which is obscene under the test promulgated in the leading case of Roth versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.816" offset="440901">As summarized in many case, since then, perhaps most explicitly in the Book versus Attorney General of 1966, in order to convict, the state must prove the three elements (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="109.198" offset="510491">First, it must be established the predominant theme of the material taken as a whole is an appeal to currying an interest in sex and not some other kind of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.695" offset="548421">Second, the material must be patently offensive and affronting the contemporary community standards of candor in representing or depicting sexual matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.893" offset="585202">Third, that the material is utterly without redeeming social value.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.415" offset="603383">I mention those elements despite their well-known familiarity to the Court and the counsel in this field because of our belief that it is vital, that this definition be honored and adhered to, if freedom of speech is to survive the application of the obscenity laws in United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.314" offset="690945">If this definition should be weakened or abandoned, the small crack in the wall which is afforded to the general obscenity laws as to unprotected speech, will very quickly become a wide open door to the punishment of protected expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.394" offset="755206">In Roth, the Court pointed out that it was implicit in the history of the First Amendment that obscenity was utterly without redeeming social value and that finding, that belief is the basis for obscenity law as it exists today.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.154" offset="826260">And the Court has repeatedly made clear, both in full scale opinions and in per curiam reversals over the last 15 years that that definition applies so as to protect material which most people would find offensive, disgusting, of little value perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.304" offset="894909">Bit the definition must be adhered to in order for the First Amendment guaranteed to be carried out in the actual day-to-day enforcement of the laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="584.116" offset="2410116">The prime danger of the many dangers we see in the Washington opinion is that the court there expressly says that even though it is enforcing a general obscenity statute, it does not have to be guided by the Roth definition of obscenity.</text>

            <text syncTime="839.447" offset="3431504">I think it's perfectly clear that this motion picture is not obscene under the Roth definition. It has a predominant dramatic appeal, a very strong story, a story that has been often told and retold in many different versions.</text>

            <text syncTime="936.881" offset="3821146">A question of whether it's a pleasing work of art is real one of taste and not of obscenity law.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.385" offset="3851239">One man's vulgarity is another's lyric as the late like Mr. Justice Harlan had said for the Court in the Cohen case and that remark applies we believe to this motion picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.814" offset="3892931">Now here the Washington Court and the prosecution virtually concede what I have just said, namely that the film is not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.421" offset="3923337">But the playing it was obscene as shown because scenes in the movie were visible from a few nearby houses and they postulated that the privacy of the persons in those houses was necessarily invaded by the visibility of this motion picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.551" offset="3991882">The court goes on to say that it does not have to judge the material for obscenity vel non one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.971" offset="4021557">Now although this necessarily implies that a different standard exists for outdoor theaters as compared to the indoor theaters, yet, neither the court nor the prosecution has suggested what that standard might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.808" offset="4080908">The exhibitor is told in effect you maybe prosecuted under the obscenity statute for showing a non-obscene film, but it's up to you to guess at which film.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.591" offset="4124062">If the analysis of the Washington court were applied across the boards of all motion pictures, many and I believe most films could be condemned in their dissemination punished under the obscenity statutes on the basis of very short isolated single images that maybe on the screen for a matter of seconds and any such rule would be a license to suppress almost any film.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.928" offset="4233358">The outdoor theaters are an important medium of expression in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.612" offset="4252166">One of the amicus brief shows that about 25% of the nation's theaters are outdoor theaters of the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.267" offset="4286753">The potential effect of this decision unless reversed on those theaters would be chilling and suppressing to say that the very least.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.451" offset="4327504">The court's opinion below as I say lapses into such terms as offensive displays, offensive expression, personally distasteful and so on, all of which reveal that the decision below renders the statute standardless, devoid of standards and I believe the state reinforces the truth of that point in its brief when it suggests that exhibitors should be guided by the unofficial industry reading system in deciding what they should or should not exhibit on pain of criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.938" offset="4477446">It suggested in the state's brief that the motion picture production code readings should put an exhibitor on notice that if he shows an X-rated film in a manner deemed obtrusive he can be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.140" offset="4534184">But, certainly the invocation of an unofficial standard like that and we are not even shown what the standard is or standards plural are in this record cannot take the place of a legislatively inactive standard of criminal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.238" offset="4598655">The Washington Court has read Ginzburg and Michigan, Redrup and the Fanny Hill case, A Book versus Attorney General as authorizing an abandonment of the Roth definition for obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.078" offset="4670021">That we suggest is a patent and obvious misreading of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.268" offset="4690710">In Ginzburg in ruling that pandering could be considered in an evidentiary way as to whether material was obscene or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.502" offset="4731670">The court expressly said that this analysis simply elaborates the test by which the obscenity vel non of the material must be judged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.216" offset="4770540">A Book versus Attorney General was to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.270" offset="4782766">Michigan merely held that the predominant prurient appeal can be addressed to a deviant sexual group rather than the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.446" offset="4815471">In Redrup, I believe the court has misread worst of all in that per curiam decision where the court reversed a number of convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.449" offset="4855491">It pointed out that three elements were not present, namely there was not present a statue directed to juveniles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.490" offset="4883598">There was not present showing of invasion of privacy and there was not present any showing of pandering under the Ginzburg case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.656" offset="4928320">Redrup in our view of the case, left it open for the states to legislate as to juveniles and to legislate for the protection of privacy and that invitation to the states have been extended much earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.446" offset="4979415">Jacobellis versus Ohio contains a similar virtual invitation to the states to legislate as to juveniles, but holding as the court has often held that material cannot be punished under general obscenity laws because it's unsuitable for minors, that was the holding of Jacobellis and the same rule should apply for the argument is based on privacy as distinguished from minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.218" offset="5090593">We have no doubt that the states can validly legislate in this area, but as the Court pointed out last year in the Reidel decision, the task of restructuring the obscenity laws is the task of those who write and amend statues and ordinances and not the task of a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.469" offset="5163526">Washington here has bypassed that legislative procedure and by treating their obscenity statute as we have found, they have converted it into a statue with indefinite standards for the restriction of speech and therefore void for vagueness under Winter versus New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.617" offset="5240117">And as the Court held in the Interstate Circuit case in 1968, the purpose of the statue which in that case was the protection of juveniles does not mean that the standard of specificity for First Amendment purposes is relaxed. Vagueness is fatal where the privacy or minors, or some other object is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.291" offset="5334785">Just last week in the Papachristou versus Jacksonville case, the Court held an ordinance void for vagueness both because it fails to apprise the citizen and because it invites arbitrary and radical risk and both of those readings condemn the Washington statue here as it's been transformed by the lower courts into a weapon for the punishment of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.099" offset="5430080">The second basic reason for reversal which we cite, is that this petitioner who was given no fair warning that he could be prosecuted in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.063" offset="5473966">There was only one law on the Books that was the general obscenity law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.193" offset="5490475">That law necessarily told him that this picture was constitutionally protected and that it could be exhibited with legal safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.914" offset="5525375">The statute said nothing at all about anyone's right to privacy and in fact, our state Supreme Court had not even recognized a common law right to privacy until the day of this very decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.628" offset="5580232">So nothing told Mr. Rabe that he could be prosecuted for exhibiting a non-obscene film, at a drive-in, the screen which could be seen from a distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.541" offset="5631850">The state in effect, convicted him of an ex post facto common law crime and the ruling below runs a file of Cohen versus California reversing a conviction in a speech context because there was no statue putting the appellant there on notice that certain types of conduct or speech would not be tolerated in certain settings or times or place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.361" offset="5739161">As in Bouie versus Columbia, the decision here is unforeseeable and retroactive judicial expansion of precise statuary language, therefore the conviction deprives petitioner of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.279" offset="5790779">It's worth noting also I think that even had there been such a crime on the Books, there was no evidence that the petitioner committed it, in the sense that there was no showing that anyone's privacy was in fact invaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.512" offset="5851696">As the Court held in the McCown case, the presumed presence of unwitting viewers or listeners should not be sufficient to give rise to criminal liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.036" offset="6213858">The film was seized as evidence on the basis of a John Doe type of arrest warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.569" offset="6239980">That warrant was issued on the basis of the uncross examined testimony of one police officer at an ex parte hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.344" offset="6267043">The magistrate did not see the film that merely hurt the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.395" offset="6283239">The proximate result of that was that this print was suppressed for an entire year through the trial court stage of the proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1581.700" offset="6400477">Each print of the motion picture is expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.910" offset="6409358">Each one is made in a laboratory and prints are then dispersed around the United States for first round and then second round and so on and at any given time, there maybe, if it's a major motion picture, there maybe a few hundred prints in the country but each one is committed to exhibition at certain times and places like contracts between the distributor and the exhibitor.</text>

            <text syncTime="2046.918" offset="8261335">As I said I have done page 9 of our brief a short exert from that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.987" offset="8285577">It was expressly indicated by Mr. Justice Brennan that that material was judged in the abstract and that it was expressly pointed out at circumstances of production, sale and publicity are relevant to a determination of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.482" offset="8371572">Petitioner here has continually referred to the the film as non-obscene, that's the language of this brief, that's his comments to the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.043" offset="8405845">He suggests in his reply brief on page one and he suggested to Your Honors today, that we practically concede that non-obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.422" offset="8443357">On the contrary the respondent urges and the court below determined that it is in fact obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.768" offset="8480764">Petitioner's conviction under the state's obscenity statute rests solely on that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.359" offset="8511066">Now what the court below and what Justice McGowan said in his opinion was simply that in an abstract determination the film would probably pass the Roth-Memoirs definition of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.855" offset="8581074">Opinion below suggests in paraphrasing that some might find it not utterly without redeeming social value, but in the context of its display, in the outdoor theater, hoisted up on the nearby residency, it was in fact obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.458" offset="8667487">In that particular regard I have noted, would interest the Morality amicus curiae brief which urges that the utterly without redeeming social value is not part of the test for obscenity established by Roth and we need not reach that issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.226" offset="8750557">In my view, whether social value is or is not or privately test, should be important only in an abstract determination of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.644" offset="8808235">I say that because assuming that Morality is wrong in their amicus brief and assuming that other utterly without redeeming social value is a part of the test and assuming for the moment that Carmen Baby has some redeeming social value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.476" offset="8891618">That social value is certainly going to be lost or obscured to those unwilling viewers of this outdoor display.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.488" offset="8931637">Now petitioner Rabe completely overlooks that fact and he suggests in his brief on page 20 that if the householder took time to watch the entire film, it would presumably be restored to constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.407" offset="9015334">Now that's really a novel unique idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.613" offset="9028082">Picture if you will, a home owner who views an erotic scene, very offensive to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.952" offset="9053473">Now petitioner would ask him to go ahead and view the rest of the scene, so the petitioner's constitutional rights would be protected, views a little bit, but they ask him to ahead then and watch more of this offensive material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.647" offset="9112300">It hasn't been argued orally today but it was called somewhat in the brief that the Washington Court, both the Lower Court and the Supreme Court, were permitted to consider this film Carmen Baby as the residents as the arresting officer outside the screen or perhaps the younger children had without the soundtrack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.674" offset="9208326">Now if that's the way it's being displayed to those people outside the theater, why should he quarrel with us judging it in that same vein.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.064" offset="9249913">If you don't have the soundtrack, if you are displaying it without a soundtrack then it should be judged without a sound track.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.847" offset="9281051">For these reasons I say whether or not social value is a part of an abstract determination should not be a deciding factor in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.479" offset="9323579">This is an outdoor display, a motion picture with a dominate theme, appealing to prurient interest in sex, a movie with erotic sexual scenes, respondent urges that such a set of circumstances is amply sufficient within the guidelines of this Court to establish the obscenity of this display.</text>

            <text syncTime="3573.899" offset="14369286">This Court's cases of Marcus and A Quantity of Books and Lee Art Theatre, are the only cases I think on point of seizure of this type of material.</text>

            <text syncTime="3586.496" offset="14419651">They present no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.296" offset="14426860">They are cases which were decided on the basis of the nature and the purpose of the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.273" offset="14446713">Lee Art Theatre was a case of seizure for evidence and does not support the proposition that a prior advisory hearing is necessary, only that a warrant or seizure requires more than a conclusory affidavit of an officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.195" offset="14506482">The confusion seems to arise in the lower courts from the failure to recognize a basic distinction, a distinction between seizure and its suppression as Marcus and the Quantity of Books and seizure aimed at securing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.996" offset="14565623">(Inaudible) decided in 1968 prior to Lee Art Theatre seems to appreciate the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.887" offset="14593208">Interestingly enough that was the first circuit court case on this point and it said a prior advisory hearing, but that was a case where they had seized four copies of a film, the same film for prosecution and they said you can't do that.</text>
