            <label>Mr. Morris A. Shenker</label>
            <text syncTime="45.373" offset="255123">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.064" offset="269961">This case involves an indictment that was returned in the City of St. Louis charging a labor union, Local 562 -- Pipefitters Union Local Number 562 and three individuals that conspire to make unlawful -- to make political contributions from that Local.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.315" offset="398901">The indictment in the case alleged that a political fund was established from which fund contributions would be made and the indictment stated that this fund was the fund of the Local Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.927" offset="493360">There was no allegation in the indictment that the contributions were made involuntary by the members of the union and non-members of the Union who worked under the jurisdiction of the Union, who made these contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.023" offset="573817">And the indictment alleges that as part of that scheme or artifacts that the funds were collected by officers, stewards, members, and employees of the fund -- that is of the union and they were also collecting that the members and the officers of the Union were collecting for the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.238" offset="662633">Pre-trial motions were filed and in the pre-trial motions, it was alleged that the indictment was attacked on the ground that it was not charged that the contributions were made involuntarily on the ground that it was not alleged in the indictment that the payments were union dues and that the gist of the pre-trial motion was -- and the gist was that this was really a parallel political fund that was set up by the Union and that for purpose of receiving and making political expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.796" offset="848834">Receiving political contributions or making political expenditures and we contended that there was no violation shown on the face of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.912" offset="889376">A bill of particulars was requested but instead of the bill of particulars, the government merely filed a court memorandum and in that memorandum, the government stated that it was not necessary that it was no necessity to prove that the funds were not volunteered.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.218" offset="978506">That voluntariness was not an essence of the crime that was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.784" offset="1000762">The government's theory of the case at the trial was that they submitted an instruction and that instruction which was set up in appellants and petitioners’ brief in pages 12 and 13 lists a number of grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.454" offset="1079443">The original 10 grounds which are listed on page 12 were submitted by the government and that the request of the defendants’ additional grounds were at it and that basis, the Court instructed the jury and gave that as the task that those are the matters which the jury could consider whether the fund was in fact a fund of the Union or rather that was a voluntary political fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.689" offset="1208384">That was established by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.566" offset="1223953">The defendants’ requested instructions where in it would specifically state as to that making voluntary payments as a defense and the Court said in the instruction however, the mere fact that the payments into the fund may have been made voluntary by some or even all of the contributors thereto does not of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.697" offset="1328442">The Court said it means that the monies that were paid into the fund was not union money and it is on that theory on which the case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.400" offset="1363238">The defendants also submitted two instructions which I will refer to later.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.370" offset="1379120">They submitted many instructions, but two particular instructions which we thought set up specifically the law that should be governed in accordance with the prior decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.747" offset="1432619">But the Court refused all of the requested instructions from the defendants and the only ones that the Court incorporated were those which are set out in the footnote on page 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.639" offset="1488207">Now the facts were as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.146" offset="1498238">But first let me say this, let me say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.998" offset="1509628">The jury found the defendants guilty and the individuals as well as the union?</text>
            <text syncTime="365.415" offset="1535332">The union was fined $5,000.00 and each defendant was sentenced to one year in jail and a punishment, an additional fine of $1,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.633" offset="1580158">The history of the fund is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.461" offset="1591548">In 1949, a political fund was established by this, a voluntary political fund was established by this union and it was administered independently openly and notoriously and they made contributions of hundreds of thousands of dollars from 1949 on until the date of the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.745" offset="1704606">But there was one change that took place in this fund in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.270" offset="1730728">The union negotiated a contract with the employers who provided for a check off system and when they provided for the check off system, they consulted with their lawyer, a very prominent labor lawyer in the St. Louis who has devoted most of his lifetime to labor law, Mr. Harry Craig whose name is mentioned and who was a witness in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.327" offset="1835009">And Mr. Craig at that time suggested, in view of a decision that was in the law that prevailed that the Eastern District of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.506" offset="1871685">It was a case wherein the Teamsters were prosecuted at Local 688 was prosecuted for making contributions from the union to which the judge sustained a motion to dismiss after the evidence was in on the ground that this was -- that the money came in voluntarily to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.492" offset="1955695">Mr. Craig first suggested that there should be a check off of the political contributions that is the voluntary political contributions in the same manner as they checked off the other monies that was collected by the Union but it would be paid specifically to the voluntary political fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.590" offset="2043989">After a while, Mr. Craig changed his mind and provided a form which was to be filled out by each of the members that wanted to contribute to the political fund and that is where in they provided and stated in the form that they are willing to make voluntary contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.806" offset="2136880">They are willing to contribute so much per day’s work and that they can cancel that whenever they desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.537" offset="2167809">They can discontinue giving that money and that they understood it is voluntary and that they understood specifically that this money is being given for political and other purposes to be administered by this independent fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.700" offset="2228518">After that was done, then it was decided to continue to collect the money in the same manner which they did before.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.643" offset="2264253">That is the foreman or the stewards on the job continued to collect the money and send it in to this political organization, that is to this voluntary of political, charitable, and educational fund.</text>

            <label>Mr. Morris A. Shenker</label>
            <text syncTime="573.038" offset="2365817">No sir, this was a complete fund -- a fund that was all put in together of all the people that contributed and then those people and then they have political meetings often and would endorse candidates and they had an administrator of the fund who could act as he sought it and that which have brought powers to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.984" offset="2461634">But an answer to that question, I might tell you, that it so happens that most of the contributors that does –- Well, I put it like this, all the witnesses that testified were testified that they were democrats and they contributed to the democratic party and then one person that testified, he said he was a republican and that he did not contribute to the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.763" offset="2564766">That was one of the witnesses that testified so that -- that question would answer your question directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.703" offset="2592456">They did not specify.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.286" offset="2598829">Well, they could stop contributing anytime they wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.395" offset="2615234">Of the evidence that was offered, the government introduced 12 stewards and foreman who collected the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.306" offset="2650865">Some of those, at least one foreman as I recall, it is in the record testified that even though he collected contributions, he himself never contributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.071" offset="2693915">They also testified that in many of these other government witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.390" offset="2707185">They also testified that in many instances, when some people did not contribute that he called and asked the director or other people who were in charge of the fund and they told him there is nothing to be done that is strictly voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.401" offset="2771238">And that that went on two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.267" offset="2778761">And additionally, 77 witnesses testified before the defendant and there out of those 77, 32 testified that they either never contributed to the voluntary political fund either contributed that sometimes and not contributed at other times or contributed whenever they felt like it as many times they did not contribute.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.417" offset="2887326">The testimony also shows that while there was a complete record kept of the money that was received that there was no way from the records to determine if anyone paid often full or continuously paid or whether there was a way of finding out from the records if a person was delinquent and did not pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.067" offset="2985964">The evidence also showed that no effort was ever made to get people to pay off anything that may have been delinquent or that they may not have paid in accordance with their written instrument wherein they agreed to contribute to the voluntary fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="758.392" offset="3107277">But for the sake of discussion, I think while the record does not show I would have to say that a large number of the people of the members of the union as well as the people that worked under the jurisdiction of that union did sign that agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.706" offset="3192540">It was a fund that was administered, that had separate bank accounts.</text>

            <text syncTime="787.644" offset="3224305">They made payments out of that fund by check.</text>

            <text syncTime="1781.109" offset="7198157">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.603" offset="7224070">Since 1907, Congress has prohibited corporations and national banks from making contributions to certain political campaigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.320" offset="7270986">This legislation has been changed over the years in the history has recounted in previous opinions of this Court between the Auto Workers case in Volume 353 U.S. In 1943, Congress first extended the same prohibitions to labor unions on a temporary wartime basis and then 25 years ago in 1947, this prohibition against unions and against corporations, the same prohibition was made permanent in the statute under which the present prosecution was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.459" offset="7435558">The legislative history of these provisions which has also been recounted in previous opinions shows a dual congressional purpose (a) to protect the electoral process from undue influence which in some instances Congress believed threatened the very integrity and the representative character of the elections and (b) to protect the individual stockholders and individual union members from having their funds used to support political causes they might disagree with or that they might prefer not to support financially.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.001" offset="7621654">And it seems to us not to be coincidental that the extension of these prohibitions to unions followed upon the protective legislation of the preceding decade such as the National Labor Relations Act, Norris-LaGuardia Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.366" offset="7699185">The result of that legislation like corporations, unions that became aggregations of economic power fostered an important way by government through the granting of special legal status and special prerogatives, legal powers which might induce individuals to pull their economic resources in these organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.473" offset="7807541">And the Congressional concern that is manifested through the legislative history was the payments made by individuals to these organizations for reasons other than a desire to support particular candidates for public office might be diverted to that use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.293" offset="7894895">Congress sought to assure through this legislation that when individuals join together for the purpose of supporting political campaigns, it will be done truly of their own volition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.494" offset="7951633">It will be a matter of their own deliberate choice and not something that results from the power of organizations being applied to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.117" offset="7998131">Now in the present case, unlike the preceding ones in which this Court has considered the statute, disbursements from the Pipefitters Fund were made directly to Federal Political candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.094" offset="8066049">So that is true in the sum of almost $100,000.00 in the 1964 Election and almost $50,000.00 in the 1966 Election which are the only two Federal Elections during the indictment period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.007" offset="8129683">The indictment was in the Spring of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.476" offset="8151626">And there is no question about what these are contributions or expenditures within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.415" offset="8175345">The entire issue is whether these contributions or expenditures were made by the union for purposes of applying the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2498.846" offset="10069014">It seems to me that that is what the jury was asked to decide and if you do not mind, I will just very quickly read through that paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.336" offset="10107048">In this case the evidence was offered by the government to the effect that funds were contributed to or on behalf of candidates for federal office and that such funds were paid out upon checks drawn upon Pipefitters Fund, I will call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.342" offset="10167025">It is necessary therefore that the evidence established that the Pipefitters Fund was in fact a union fund that the money there in was union money and that the real contributor to the candidates was the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.670" offset="10228361">As to this issue, the defendants contend that the fund in question was a bona fide entity separate and apart from the union established by the Voluntary Good Faith Act of members of Pipefitters Local 562 and others from which contributions to candidates were made on behalf of the persons who created the fund and not on behalf of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.195" offset="10318431">On the other hand, the government contend that the fund was a mere artificer device set up by the defendants and others as a part of the alleged conspiracy to give the outward appearance of being an independent and separate entity but in fact constituting a part of union funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="2597.684" offset="10464403">But the question is put; I think most succinctly in this paragraph and much of the argument in the briefs on the other side and in the oral argument on the other side seems to be based on the premise that the jury decided this issue of fact in favor of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.081" offset="10542039">But of course, the verdict indicates that the factual issue was decided in support of the government’s theory of the case, that the fund was an artificer device through which the union was making contributions of the union money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.998" offset="10609644">And we think there is ample evidence in the case to support this factual determination by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.072" offset="10646007">I would like to briefly recount some of that evidence to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.939" offset="10677458">In the first place, Local 562 had jurisdiction over all the major jobs in more than half of the State of Missouri and contractors in this area had to get their Pipefitters for major jobs from Local 562 during this period even though there were three other locals located in the area whose members regularly worked on jobs under 562’s jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.527" offset="10795740">Those jobs paid more than the jobs under the jurisdiction of the other local and the principle operating revenues of this local came from assessments imposed as fixed sums per day worked on each member of this local or each out of town.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.841" offset="10881004">They are working under the local’s jurisdiction in the pre-indictment period and smaller monthly dues were paid by the members which were passed through the international and large part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.166" offset="10938369">The fund involved here, the Pipefitters fund was began in 1949 and at first, the assessments for the fund and for the union dues were made to gather and exactly the same way and applied and exactly the same way to both the members of the local and the out-of-towner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.730" offset="11028648">The first 25 cents per day was paid by each man as a union assessment and 25 cents per day to the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.614" offset="11060100">Later it was 50 cents per day to each and starting in January 1963, which is the indictment period, the Local stopped collecting assessments from the non-members but a pattern was established whereby each of these non-members would contribute to the fund at the same rate as the total of the daily contribution of a member of the Local to the fund and added to his assessment to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.510" offset="11211714">And these were still being treated for all practical purposes collected in a manner that they have previously been collected as assessments.</text>

            <text syncTime="2825.757" offset="11376704">But we do not rely on that testimony alone because most of the evidence, it seems to us indicates that both the union leadership and the members and the out-of-towners considered this just part of their regular obligations to the union that would be regularly paid and indeed were regularly paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.051" offset="11485896">And at one point, the union’s executive board conveyed this impression of the membership quite clearly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2868.713" offset="11548485">In the middle of page 11, at the time that there was a 50 cent increase in the assessment, the daily assessment of union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.566" offset="11595923">The Executive Board minutes distributed to the members explicitly tied this to a 50 cent decrease in the contributions of the fund that would then be expected of the members of the Local.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.316" offset="11662901">And the quotation from the minutes distributed to the members was we believe when the details are explained to all of you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.432" offset="11707414">All will agree as we do on this matter because this will not be one extra penny cost to members of Local Union 562.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.315" offset="11750986">The whole assumption is that every member pays the prescribed contribution to the fund. And therefore because the union treasury needed more money and adjustment would be made, 50 cents more to the treasury, 50 cents less to the fund for internal bookkeeping purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.629" offset="11840220">It would not affect the financial obligations of the members at all.</text>
