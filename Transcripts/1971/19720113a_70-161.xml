            <text syncTime="56.817" offset="300991">Good afternoon Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.604" offset="324084">These two cases are here before the Court on cross appeals and have been consolidated for purposes of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.195" offset="366506">These cases arise from a final judgment, a statutory Three-Judge Court for the United States District Court of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.286" offset="438813">The court below held that Section 225 of the Social Security Act was unconstitutional and that under that Act the recipient of the Social Security Disability Insurance was not afforded the opportunity for an oral hearing prior to suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.217" offset="570575">The court below relied on the decision of this Court in a recent case, Goldberg v. Kelly, which has since become rather well-known in this particular field of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.039" offset="633791">Section 225 of the Social Security Act permits the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare on information obtained by him or submitted to him to suspend the benefits, the payments to a Social Security Disability Insurance recipient pending further investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.259" offset="770673">This particular section of the Social Security Act has no provision whatsoever for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.112" offset="814141">It should be noted also Your Honors that this particular section of the Social Security Act has been commented on in the floor debates of the Congress and in the reports of the various committees of the Congress and its purpose has been explicitly stated to permit the Secretary to protect the Social Security Trust Funds to administer the Social Security Disability Insurance Program in a practical, efficient and helpful manner so as to assist the maximum number of beneficiaries within the resources available.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.025" offset="1005775">This case first arose when the appellee, cross appellant, one Radie Wright, applied in the Washington D.C. District Office for Social Security benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.648" offset="1072230">Mr. Wright had worked since the age of 14 and had been recently hospitalized in October of 1965 to be exact in his application, for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits which was filed June 1, 1966.</text>

            <text syncTime="1144.040" offset="4649857">When BDI learned of earnings for Mr. Wright, earnings for the June quarter of 1968 for the December quarter of 1968 and for the first quarter of 1969, they immediately cause the field investigation to be instituted and that referral was made to the Social Security District Office in the District of Columbia.</text>

            <text syncTime="1177.079" offset="4782036">The young lady who interviewed him stated to him that indeed, it looked as though his Social Security Disability Insurance benefits might be in jeopardy because of his having worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.643" offset="4840237">That of course is one of the provisions of the Social Security Act, one of the definitions of disability, if an individual is able to engage in substantial gain from activity he cannot be disabled under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.380" offset="4903244">Well, the investigation proceeded and as it turned out, Mr. Wright had indeed, apparently felt better because he worked, he not only worked in the June 1968 quarter to December 1968 quarter, that he worked in every quarter of the calendar year 1969 and he earned approximately six hundred dollars and some cents in 1968 and Four Thousand and Fort-one dollars and some cents in 1969.</text>

            <text syncTime="1464.808" offset="5932887">He brought suit on May 13, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.747" offset="5944694">On May 14, 1970, Judge Gasch issued a temporary restraining order restraining the Secretary from suspending Mr. Wright’s benefits and that action was taken and Mr. Wright has been paid the benefits since then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.520" offset="6023793">And then Mr. John D. Atkins, plaintiff intervener, enters this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.807" offset="6044900">He does not come into the case until about August, but he comes in as a plaintiff intervener on the basis that he had been hospitalized by reason of mental illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.254" offset="6086696">And he was hospitalized over in the Veterans Administration Hospital at Perry Point, Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.389" offset="6107280">And he was hospitalized in December of 1966 and began receiving benefits some six months thereafter and remained in that hospital over there until January 7 of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.425" offset="6171333">The Social Security Administration, for some reason or another, did not find out that Mr. Atkins was no longer in Perry Point until about September of 1969 when his check was returned from Perry Point VA Hospital to the Social Security Administration to BDI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.485" offset="6235594">Apparently, Perry Point had been forwarding his checks to Mr. Atkins because Mr. Atkins had left the VA Hospital at Perry Point, Maryland and had gone over to Virginia to another hospital, mental hospital, Western Hospital at Salem, Virginia, stayed there, a short period of time then went down to the Veteran’s Administration Hospital at Roanoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.740" offset="6332665">But when Social Security received the notice, received the check back that immediately triggered off in accordance with its procedures a continuing disability investigation and they had to find out what Mr. Atkins was up to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.733" offset="6396613">So, the claim folder went first to Towson, Maryland and then it went down to Virginia, but suffice to say the case finally became one before the State Agency there in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.120" offset="6442170">The State Agency went through the same routine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.482" offset="6455649">They contacted Mr. Atkins, talked with his clinical psychologist, looked very, very carefully at the medical evidence then available to them and made a decision that Mr. Atkins condition had physically improved sufficiently so that he was no longer disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.962" offset="6537569">Mr. Atkins, this occurred on February 3, 1970, on February 4, 1970, Mr. Atkins wrote to Social Security Administration and protested, submitted his own evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.533" offset="6583858">His wife called BDI three or four times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.450" offset="6599427">His Congressman got in touched with Social Security Administration and to compress the facts in view the fact time is rapidly running out on me, Your Honors, he was reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.208" offset="6650523">His case was sent back rather quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.677" offset="6660345">Another hard look was taken at additional evidence and he was reinstated and I think if I may Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to reserve the balance of my time for any rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert N. Sayler</label>
            <text syncTime="1669.448" offset="6751460">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.593" offset="6760028">I am here representing several named individuals in the class of disability recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.935" offset="6785419">The government’s presentation has made clear that we are dealing here with a complicated statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.707" offset="6812482">That should not obscure the fact that the legal issues in this case are uncomplicated, had been considerably narrowed in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.376" offset="6847173">When this case begun nearly two years ago, the government was arguing that the provision in the statute authorizing summary suspension of disability payments was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.370" offset="6887192">Now, Judges Gasch, Robb and Matthews disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.485" offset="6899626">The government has abandoned that contention and this Court it concedes that that statutory section is unconstitutional and it concedes that there is a right to an opportunity to a hearing before disability benefits are terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.368" offset="6959186">Now, these are the propositions that we had been attempting to establish in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.590" offset="6976008">We had assumed that once they were recognized that would obviate the necessity for action by this Court and that has not proved to be the case because in this Court, the government contends that the right to a hearing it would provide means a paper hearing and calls a hearing on paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.282" offset="7054794">By this, the government says it would provide notice if it found conflicting evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.246" offset="7078617">It would provide a brief summary of evidence adverse to the recipient, providing opportunity to file his paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.268" offset="7114771">It would not under any circumstances, regardless, whether or not conflicting evidence of continuing disability existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.703" offset="7144446">It would not provide opportunity for an oral proceeding of any kind, would not assure decision by an impartial decision maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.324" offset="7183003">The government’s basic position is that these latter procedural protections are unnecessary because the decisions in this area, uniquely objective and reliable, as Mr. Gray just said, the government bends over backwards to assure that recipients may stay on the roles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.828" offset="7248936">There is one overwhelming statistic which demonstrates the difficulty the government has in sustaining that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.099" offset="7278088">Present time, hearings are required as a matter of statutory right after termination, many months down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.606" offset="7308077">In those cases, paper determinations that disability has ceased are reversed in 55% of the cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.259" offset="7342663">More times than not, when the recipient gets to the hearing has an opportunity to tell his the story, present affirmative evidence, cross-examine would prevail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1980.079" offset="7993948">Do you disagree with the general statements of the Court in McElroy that due process is a flexible concept and you have to analyze it precisely what it is that you are affecting before you decide what procedures will be accorded?</text>

            <text syncTime="1995.870" offset="8057164">Our basic proposition is that Cafeteria established basic propositions which have been set forth in number of other cases that the Court is obliged to indulge in a balancing of the interest of the government on the one side, and persons affected by governmental interest on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.044" offset="8121844">We think this is the case where the balance must be struck very much on the side of the recipient in view of depressing the disability payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.050" offset="8165834">We have indicated the statistics in our brief on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.973" offset="8181612">Facts are that disability recipients are over half dependent on disability benefits for their income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.692" offset="8208466">Most of them are over 80% dependent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.339" offset="8219019">As a category, the disability recipients have very low level of educational attainment which very much hampers their prospects to gain substantial income once they are terminated the disability role.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.422" offset="8267398">Their work experience, even those who are able to work, is not very bright and their labor experience is characterized by extremely high unemployment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2061.908" offset="8321315">Our point is that the prospect of a man who is cut-off from the disability program, a man who must have qualified in the first instance under the most rigid definition of disability.</text>

            <text syncTime="2137.943" offset="8625484">Now, the problem with that estimate, Your Honor, is that it assumes that every person who is terminated in an effort to gain an unwarranted payments would demand a hearing and experience under Goldberg in the welfare context does not bear that out at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.594" offset="8683999">Less than 10% of the District of Columbia persons who are cut-off from welfare are now demanding hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2835.648" offset="11416302">One other reason we think that it would be intolerable to distinguish Goldberg in this case is that the upshot would be that the States which administer the Welfare Program would be upheld to a higher procedural due process requirement under the Federal Constitution then with the Federal Government which administers the Social Security Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.508" offset="11503656">I want to say one final word about the relief we seek in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2865.959" offset="11537510">It can remand to lower court to enjoin further terminations without affording the preliminary hearings, satisfying Goldberg and Kelly standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.565" offset="11587979">The character of the government’s argument has suggested an alternative approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.560" offset="11603966">The government now does concede the unconstitutionality of the exception in the Act which permits summary termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.883" offset="11641164">Now, admitting the unconstitutional, unconstitutionality of that provision leaves that stand in standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.627" offset="11668227">Only the general requirement in the Act that an oral hearing must precede final agency action, that is set forth in Sections 405 and 421, Section 1303 of the Act is the severability provision which says if one provision is declared unconstitutional the rest of the Act remains standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.620" offset="11744191">What this would mean would be that the general requirement would have take oral hearings which are now statutorily required as a matter of statutory construction would have to be held before disability benefits could be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.622" offset="11816185">This in effect gives the matter back to Congress and it says the summary suspension that you have undertaken will not satisfy the recent teachings of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.449" offset="11855473">We declare that Section unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.056" offset="11869893">Congress at that point either leaves the existing oral hearings as they are and order them to speed it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.278" offset="11906777">Congress on the other hand may decide that it does want to have some sort of a preliminary determination before the full scale APA hearing and it may decide that it wants to institute a Goldberg and Kelly type oral hearing which meets just the rudimentary requirements of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.477" offset="11983577">This we think should more appropriate be -- appropriately be determined by the Congress rather than the government in their brief which has undertaken at 13th hour in this case to rewrite a summary suspension provision into the Act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.510" offset="12051705">The essence of our case is that as the Court said in Perales, the Social Security System must be fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.397" offset="12091306">We do not think procedures which fall short of the Goldberg and Kelly standards can be said to be fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.270" offset="12126728">We would urge this Court to make it clear that those standards obtained in this area as well as in other areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3027.845" offset="12185034">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.999" offset="12201648">May it please the Court, I would like just to make a brief comment regarding Mr. Sayler’s statement concerning reversal rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.313" offset="12250967">The appendix D in the government’s brief contains the statistics for Fiscal Year 1971 and much can be done with figures as we all know and I think the only fair way to handle this particular matter of the reversal rate and the -- that play on numbers is to take the actual number of claims that are processed and then trace those through and find the reversals and that brings you to a 6.6% rate of reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.388" offset="12379176">That speaks something for the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.921" offset="12389311">At least, there are sufficient number of individuals somewhere throughout this total number of claims who do not feel that the system has dealt with them unfairly and I would merely submit to the Court that this kind of a consideration be given to dealing with statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.310" offset="12478964">I would like also to point out once again and reaffirm the fact that the government has not conceded anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.412" offset="12507280">This is not summary decapitation that we are engaged in here and we have never considered it to be and we have not conceded any point of constitutionality and we standby firmly the points made in our brief to this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.577" offset="12587946">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
