            <text syncTime="38.192" offset="226484">This case is here out of petition for writ of certiorari from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.699" offset="252502">The question that presents is whether the First Amendment forbids the President of a State College from refusing official recognition to a student political organization when the decision is based only upon undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.063" offset="325958">The facts of the case are: that the petitioners in this case following the applicable rules of the college, Central Connecticut State College, submitted an application for recognition of a local chapter of the students for a democratic society.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.461" offset="407460">The fact of recognition has significant consequences because without it, a student group cannot meet on campus, cannot make use of any of the college’s facilities, cannot sponsor meetings on campus, cannot make use of the student newspaper, nor use of the student bulletin boards nor can it make application for student funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="120.099" offset="554060">The application that they submitted and I want to read it and its entirety because it’s really the foundation of our assertions about their First Amendment claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.493" offset="607663">Said that they would like to form a local chapter of Students for Democratic Society, and they gave three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.429" offset="635353">They said because the university is intended to be the arena of education where there is an unfettered exchange of ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.128" offset="662207">SDS would provide a form of discussion in self education for students developing an analysis of American society institutions including higher education and a world situation in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.839" offset="709018">They said that SDS would provide an agency for integrating thought with action, so as to bring about constructive changes in the university, in American life and the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.574" offset="747993">And thirdly, they said that SDS would provide a coordinating body for relating the problems of leftist students and other groups such as the student body as a whole, the working class, the black populace or whatever other individuals or groups in fact or potentially in accord with the purposes of the Central Connecticut State College Chapter of SDS.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.257" offset="834719">That application was submitted a joint student faculty committee called the Student Activities Committee, and the petitioners came before the committee who raised a few questions with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.460" offset="891457">They themselves, the committee was concerned about evidence of violent responsive, the national SDS organization at local SDS chapters throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.854" offset="933044">And they asked the petitioners about what their ties would be to the National SDS?</text>
            <text syncTime="219.067" offset="949971">And the student’s replied, this is on page 94 of the appendix that the Chapter does not affiliate with the national organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.506" offset="975676">They said, we will be completely independent and when asked why the chapter -- why they carry to use the name of National SDS.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.954" offset="1009531">They said because the name brings to mind the type of organization we wish to bring across.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.982" offset="1029593">That is a left wing organization which will allow the student’s interested in such to express themselves.</text>

            <label>Mr. F. Michael Ahern</label>
            <text syncTime="1802.189" offset="7282471">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.177" offset="7294383">Under the verbal assault of all the high sounding rhetoric of the past several years concerning the First Amendment rights of student to wear their hair long, to express their political views and to demonstrate, I fear we may well be losing sight of the purpose of the educational process, and I would like restate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.225" offset="7378602">The primary purpose of educational institutions at all levels, we submit, is to provide the best education possible to the students.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.550" offset="7411829">Not to provide a platform for the expression of political views by a few students.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.900" offset="7437220">The faculty members are hired to teach their academic specialties, not to radicalize and politicize the students.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.935" offset="7469403">And the students who voluntarily enter the educational community should do so to learn and not to attempt to influence their fellow students to accept their own political philosophies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.912" offset="7521335">Generally speaking, the vast majority of students enter the college community with an understanding that the president and the deans are in charge, and they have the obligation to exercise their authority to maintain an educational climate that is conducive to learning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.712" offset="7596567">Indeed, every student is entitled to expect that the administrators will so operate the college that he will give full measure, full educational measure for every dollar of tuition expended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.898" offset="7645260">This means that any disruption of classes or interference with the educational process cannot be tolerated or condone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.062" offset="7677965">The campus strikes in disruptions of a last few years which have been led by small minority of radical students are to deplored because they cheated the majority of students out of the opportunity to attend classes, excuse me, wasted the examination, preparation by the students because the exams were never held, and even cancelled or postponed commencement exercises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.774" offset="7784753">And I submit that at least this situation was partly caused by the college administrators refusing or being unwilling to exercise their authority to close disturbances at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.559" offset="7835953">However, I submit the administrators are not entirely to blame.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.704" offset="7856433">The rush of decisions of the federal courts following the so called arrival of the constitution on the campus has had a chilling effect on the responsible administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.220" offset="7898543">Almost every administrative decision which is made for the purpose of securing order or controlling student conduct on the campus is immediately challenge in the courts and becomes the subject of an extensive and time consuming legal process before it is resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.662" offset="7964267">This case I submit exemplifies the difficulties which college officials have faced and continue to face in attempting to administer the colleges throughout the country whenever the administrative decision is escalated into a constitutional issue and the confrontation between a few students and the authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.670" offset="8040336">The petitioners in the instant case have arrogantly sought recognition of their local chapter of students for a democratic society on their terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.057" offset="8081922">When the president and his deans refuse to exceed to those terms, the petitioners immediately raised the specter of interference with their constitutional rights of free speech and free association and sought the aid of the federal courts to impose their will on the administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.891" offset="8149214">The precise issue in this case has never been considered by this Court previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.979" offset="8169589">That issue we submit is whether the denial of official campus recognition to the local chapter of Students for a Democratic Society at Central Connecticut State College violated in any way the individual constitutional rights of the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.306" offset="8234896">We submit that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.147" offset="8246285">Without demeaning in the least the importance of that issue, I submitted Healy's to insignificance in the light of the greater issue that is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.867" offset="8285155">That is who shall govern the colleges of this country, the students or the college officials?</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.188" offset="8306471">As the late Justice Black noted in his dissent in Tinker, it is nothing but wishful thinking to imagine that young immature students will not soon believe that it is their right to control the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.038" offset="8353805">And I think those words were prophetic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.683" offset="8368433">Recognizing that there are no legal presidents for their position, the petitioners here had advanced the proposition that a college community is somewhat like a municipality and should be considered as such by the Court in applying the protections of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.723" offset="8432590">If this Courts accepts the petitioners’ theory, it will mean that a student entering an educational community has an unfettered right to exercise his First amendment rights of free speech and free association on the campus.</text>

            <text syncTime="3181.657" offset="12800264">Those cases cited by the decent dealt with the citizen’s relationship to society at large, while here, we are dealing with the student’s relationship and a voluntary community composed of students, faculty and administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.325" offset="12855016">The administrators, pardon me, the petitioners advanced the proposition in their brief that this case gives the Court the opportunity to implant the First Amendment firmly on the college campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.627" offset="12900156">We submit that the constitution has already been firmly entrenched on the college campus, and a few radical students have used it or rather abused it to spread violence and disruption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.807" offset="12948848">What is needed is more responsible administrative leadership on the campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.084" offset="12965984">Not further restriction of administrative authority in the name of constitutional freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.957" offset="12985524">As we stated previously, what has caused the problems on the campuses in prior years, we submit has been a failure of the authorities to govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.120" offset="13022200">It would be in deed ironic if in the name of the petitioners alleged right to administrative support of their so called political programs, this Court would announce a rule that deprive school officials with backbone to face up to their responsibilities as the respondents in this case of any power to govern their institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.193" offset="13102448">This Court would be upholding the attack by a few on the rights of academic freedom of the vast majority of student.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.772" offset="13128780">For without the power to prohibit a campus organization which he reasonably believes to be harmful to the academic climate of this college, the college president might as well resign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.328" offset="13178935">He would have no authority in the one area where it really counts, that is upholding the moral integrity of the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.760" offset="13204744">Lacking the essential governing power, he would lack the authority to protect the majority of students on the campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.218" offset="13230553">And lacking such support of the administration, those students would have no means say cumbersome and expensive legal process to ensure their personal academic freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.065" offset="13269945">So, we submit that does in the name of freedom for the few, would be freedom of all be compromised? I submit that the court should reemphasize and restate a non-equivocal terms the authority of the school administrators to prescribe and control conduct in the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.615" offset="13336087">And that although the students do not leave their constitutional rights at the door, those rights maybe curtailed and restricted by rules, reasonable rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.189" offset="13374435">A Judge in a United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas recently phrased it very concisely in the case of Egner v. Texas City Independent School District reported in 40 U.S. Law 2556, the February 2972 edition, and I quote from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.578" offset="13444025">“To the extent that such routine conflicts become the subject of frequent constitutional adjudication in the Lower Federal Courts, it is inevitable that a monolithic and stultifying national uniformity will be judicially imposed in the name of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.291" offset="13502853">Since the general terms of the amendment contained no concrete standards of decision for the great majority of such suits, it is predictable that the federal common law of school discipline which would develop will reflect nothing more than the amalgam of the educational views of diverse federal judges.</text>
