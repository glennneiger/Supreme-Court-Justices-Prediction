            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="7.867" offset="105185">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.482" offset="119605">This is an appeal by the United States from a decision of the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in a civil antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.578" offset="155967">The appellee, defendant in the District Court is Topco Associates Inc. Topco is a cooperative corporation, which procures grocery and related nonfood products for 23 supermarket chains and two wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.234" offset="230573">These chains and wholesalers are owner members of the corporation and they control it.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.500" offset="259726">The restriction challenged by the government is an agreement among the member chains through Topco that they will not retail Topco branded products outside of specified territories and that they will not sell Topco supply products at wholesale.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.236" offset="330674">The government contended in the District Court that the arrangement was a horizontal territorial allocation scheme, which was illegal per se under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.645" offset="376232">After a trial on the merits, the District Court held that the Act had not been violated and entered judgment for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.459" offset="407474">In its opinion which is at page 545 of the record and its findings of fact, which are at page 553; it concluded that the division of territories among Topco supermarket chains and the accompanying wholesale restrictions were not illegal per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.430" offset="487409">Rather the Court ruled they were reasonable restrictions ancillary to the cooperative private label program, Topco furnishes its owner members.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.402" offset="531295">I would like briefly to describe the Topco organization.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="117.592" offset="544043">This was after a full trial before Judge Hubert Will, was it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="121.552" offset="559925">That is correct Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.092" offset="574031">The Topco organization, as I said procures food and related and nonfood grocery items.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.373" offset="603184">About 55% of these are furnished to the members under brand names which are owned by Topco.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.803" offset="644875">These brand names are not nationally advertised.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.036" offset="657832">They are such names as Food Club which is the top line for canned goods; Elna which is a second line, Gallo which I think covers carbonated beverages, Top Frost and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.826" offset="728990">They include the primarily strategic grocery items.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.255" offset="742678">There are canned goods, frozen foods, carbonated beverages, cookies and crackers.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.299" offset="762844">They are sold outright to the members so that the member grocery chains had absolute title to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.672" offset="792415">Now, Topco’s member grocery chains are independent business entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.135" offset="814253">They have simply joined together through Topco for the purpose of procuring these products.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.078" offset="841943">Topco has managed much in the same way that the Sealy Corporation was managed in United States against Sealy.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.309" offset="870887">Voting stock is held equally by each member chain and the business of the corporation is conducted by 14-man Board of Directors, made up of officials who are selected from among the chief executive officers of the member chains.</text>

            <text syncTime="233.763" offset="1008709">The Topco member chains are, as I said, independent organizations and that their combined retail sales in 1967 were $2.3 billion, so that the 25 Topco organizations are fourth in retail sales after A&amp;P, Safeway and Kroger.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.022" offset="1097734">Many of the chains are very substantial in our local market.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.838" offset="1112990">Giant Foods was a member of Topco, for example, from 1960 to 1966 and it had 23% of the District of Columbia market.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.044" offset="1173907">Out of the $2.3 billion in total sales, about 10% is Topco supplied products, 237 million and about 133 million of that would be Topco brand products, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.971" offset="1245587">I started to describe the size of these organizations, which we maintain is quite substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.632" offset="1272232">The record at A17 through 25 describes them 9 members have total sales in excess each of 100 million and 20, according to my count, have sales in excess of 50 million.</text>

            <text syncTime="571.098" offset="2358090">There is no question as to the purpose of the restrictions, the purpose of the territorialization and the wholesale restrictions, which supplement them, are to protect the members from each others competition in the sale of Topco branded products, that is why you have an exclusive arrangement like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.583" offset="2424023">And, it was the government’s position in the District Court, it is the government’s position here that this kind of arrangement affected through this of its kind of an organization is a horizontal agreement to allocate territories and to restrict wholesale operations, which is illegal per se and has been illegal per se, ever since the Addyston Pipe case, 70 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.549" offset="2535827">If this was a vertical restriction, arguably it might be a different case, although even there, I think the law is now clear that a vertical restriction on products which are sold to a business for resale and are owned by it cannot be imposed even vertically.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.742" offset="2616702">And a fortiori, when you have it horizontal as you do this case, by there is an agreement among direct and actual and potential competitors, it has to be illegal per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.454" offset="2667484">The District Court relied particularly in its decision on the Sixth Circuit’s ruling in Federal Trade Commission against Sandura Company in 339 F. 2d 847, yet that was a vertical case and in that case, the Sixth Circuit pointed out that if the arrangement before it had been a horizontal arrangement as this is, then it would have been illegal per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.366" offset="2779184">Now, I call it horizontal because this organization is almost identical in its operation to the operation in United States against Sealy.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.709" offset="2828503">When you put the Sealy case together with the ruling in United States against Schwinn Company, which also involved a territorial restriction, you come up with a plain rule that it is illegal per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.846" offset="2881061">We think the District Court should have stopped right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.478" offset="2903631">It did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.131" offset="2906243">It went on to say that this kind of territorialization is reasonable, even though is among actual and potential competitors because without competition from each other, each member would better be able to control the pricing and merchandising of Topco goods and thus, would better be able to compete with the vertically integrated chains, such A&amp;P, Kroger and Safeway.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.489" offset="3015644">The argument was that these organizations, A&amp;P, Safeway and Kroger are able through vertical integration to have exclusive private brand, that is private brands that they do not sell to anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.255" offset="3062665">So, what the Topco organization was permitted to do by the District Court was to agree among themselves not to compete, so that they could have exclusive private brands and the only way they could achieve that exclusivity, however, was by horizontal agreement among themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.728" offset="3124627">That is the justification, which is said to take this case outside the per se rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.219" offset="3150541">Our objection is not to exclusivity as such with respect to a brand nor is it to the combination of chains into a single buying organization to achieve useful economies of scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.908" offset="3209264">What we object to is the attempt to achieve exclusivity by an agreement not to compete among their actual and potential competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.658" offset="3256284">Now, when the District Court sought to justify this arrangement, it said that the government had conceded that the Topco arrangements enabled Topco members to compete better.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.479" offset="3307589">We did not make such a concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.700" offset="3316470">In our post-trial brief we said, while it may be true as the defendant contends that these unlawful agreements are intended to enable the member chains to more effectively compete with others in the marketplace, this motive does not immunize defendant’s conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.492" offset="3387628">Instead, what we urged in the District Court was that, the law just does not allow direct agreement among competitors as a means of counterbalancing the power or advantages of somebody else in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.026" offset="3445829">The same argument was made in the Schwinn case, where it was said, let us have territorialization, so that our dealers in trademark bicycles can better compete with the mass merchandisers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1400.918" offset="5677313">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.612" offset="5700092">This Court recognized in the White Motor’s case, that caution must be exercised when a per se concept is extended to embrace new practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.824" offset="5748993">The relevant inquiry in such a circumstance is not whether an existing concept can be read broadly enough to cover a new practice, but rather whether the rationale and the policy behind the rule really fits into practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.331" offset="5831017">Per se rules, after all are based upon judicial experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.763" offset="5852751">What experience then, have the Court’s have with the practices such as those here presented?</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.937" offset="5877411">I would point out that in the District Court, the government conceded that it could find no case, which would justify a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.503" offset="5923700">In its jurisdictional statement to this Court, the government pointed out that the Court had never been presented with a similar case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.335" offset="5967063">Under such circumstances, we submit that it was proper and appropriate for the District Court to engage as it did in an inquiry into the economic and business stuff to use the words of White Motor decision, from which these competitive practices emerged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.222" offset="6046580">Judge Will having done that, found, that their ultimate effect was not to detract some competition, but to enhance it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.119" offset="6094123">What then is the competitive context, which the District Court found in this industry and from which these practices emerged?</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.816" offset="6128918">There does not appear to be any dispute concerning the purpose for which Topco was formed or for which it continues to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.341" offset="6163086">The cooperative was formed in the mid-1940s by a group of local grocery chains, who recognized that the only way to successfully compete in this industry, indeed, perhaps the only way to survive in the industry, was to duplicate in some measure the advantages of scale, which the Giant mass merchandisers had attained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.595" offset="6260052">We have set forth in some detail, these advantages in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.444" offset="6283458">They are impressive and to some in the industry, were overwhelming, but Judge Will found that perhaps the most competitively significant advantage which the large regional and national chains had achieved was the private label.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.020" offset="6353780">Private label permitted these chains to reduce their costs, to lower their prices and yet to increase their profits and at the same time to instill consumer loyalty for their stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.357" offset="6415115">The national chains adopted groups of trademarks, by which to identify their private labels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.498" offset="6439670">These were often the store names themselves or contractions thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.810" offset="6460882">The trademarks and the products bearing them were exclusive in these large chain stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.383" offset="6487213">The chain, rather than the store was -- rather than a manufacturer was identified as the source of those products in the mind of the consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.779" offset="6528800">The consumers soon recognized that if her family had a preference for Ann Page Green Beans or Eight O’Clock Coffee, she was required to patronize A&amp;P stores in order to obtain those items.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.545" offset="6595883">Most of the advantages of the Giant national chains were beyond the ability of smaller operators to obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.974" offset="6625558">One which was not, however, was the private label, which through cooperative efforts, they were able to achieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.433" offset="6663383">These cooperative efforts then gave them one competitive tool which the large chains had. Many of the other advantages of the larger chains were still beyond their economic reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.413" offset="6715314">The Topco Cooperative adopted a family of brands, which each of its members could use and identify in its own marketing area as its own private label.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.227" offset="6770590">Each continued, however, to operate under its own store names. Each continued to adopt his own merchandising philosophy, his own pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.961" offset="6813535">Each continued, in short to remain independent, but for the first time in their history these independent chains, had the means of meeting the significant price competition, which only the Giant chains had theretofore offered to consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.769" offset="6888767">The trademarks however, adopted by these cooperatives, had no immediate recognition in the marketplace as often did those of the national chains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.692" offset="6936415">It was necessary for each operator to introduce those trademarks into his own marketing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.881" offset="6965254">This required an investment in time, in money, in effort, in resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.301" offset="6994929">Such an investment was designed to identify his stores with these products in the mind of a consumer, just as the large national chains had done, to build a secondary meaning for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.301" offset="7050936">If, however, the trademarks which were used as private labels were subject to use by another operator in the trading area of a member, their value as private brands would be destroyed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1823.421" offset="7367331">That is correct, but the consumer knows that if she wants to buy Ann Page Green Beans, for example, she is required to go to an A&amp;P Store in order to obtain them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.037" offset="7413829">It engendered the uniqueness for the stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.633" offset="7432219">One of the basic means of competition in this industry is to develop a uniqueness for the store, so the consumer desires to shop in one store, as opposed to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.391" offset="7475269">There are many ways of doing this, but the most competitively significant way is by as the consumer is concerned perhaps, is through a medium which offers her a good value at a low price and one which she can only get at that store and that is what A&amp;P and the larger chains use private label for.</text>

            <text syncTime="2003.821" offset="8088937">So it was necessary, in order to achieve the advantages for them to develop a family of brands, which all could use in its own marketing area, but in order to achieve this, it became a necessary element of the Topco Cooperative to have a form of trademark licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.403" offset="8183292">This trademark licensing made the system work, in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.805" offset="8200950">Its purpose was not to preclude competition among Topco members, but rather to assure that the private brands, though cooperatively obtained, would be and would remain the private brand of each member individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.532" offset="8271794">We do not contend that trademark licensing or the existence of trademarks provides any influation installations from Sherman Act liability, but what we do contend is that trademark licensing in this context serves a proper and pro-competitive purpose that in effect it makes cooperative procurement of private labels possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="2977.212" offset="11982541">Let us look at a moment at the concept of the horizontal ancillary -- horizontal restraints concept, which the government would seek to have applied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.580" offset="12036039">This per se concept concerning horizontal market division finds its origin and application in those cases, where competitors, typically those with sufficient market power to restrict output, if they chose, have combined and conspired to eliminate all competition among themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.874" offset="12125169">Such naked restraints have no capacity to achieve any beneficial effect on competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.783" offset="12156830">However, when the Courts have been presented, with restrictions which are necessary and reasonably related to achieving a legitimate venture, the Courts have refused to apply this per se analysis and properly so we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.452" offset="12227465">For such arrangements, have a capacity to intensify competition, and therefore, their ultimate effect on competition must be discerned and Judge Will did discern that effect here and found it was beneficial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.276" offset="12298831">The refusal to apply per se rule here would not, we submit, result in interminable economic inquiries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.228" offset="12334567">The doctrine of ancillary restraints provides a well defined legal concept, by which to identify those practices, which have a capacity to increase efficiency to ultimately enhance competition and to benefit the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.586" offset="12404052">This distinction was highlighted, we submit, in the Sealy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.165" offset="12422338">Sealy presented a combination of manufacturers, who agreed to refrain from selling trademark items outside of licensed areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.575" offset="12475941">Despite the government’s urging in that case, the Court did not find that those provisions were per se a violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.883" offset="12513244">Instead, the Court examined the context, found in aggregation of trade restraints, including unlawful price-fixing and policing, the ultimate purpose and effect of which was anti-competitive, but the Court specifically distinguished those quite different situations, such as restrictions incident to cooperative efforts among small grocers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.849" offset="12617107">In Topco, grocers have entered into cooperative efforts, not for the purpose of eliminating competition among themselves, not for the purpose of restricting channels of distribution, but for the purpose of creating new grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.561" offset="12679905">More important, competitively significant private labels and in so doing, they have created new competition in industry which did not exist before and which can continue to exist only because of the licensing provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.394" offset="12755243">We do not contend because Topco members are small, medium-sized chain because their purpose is to assist their members to better compete in the industry that the Sherman Act does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.707" offset="12808532">What we do contend is that the ultimate effect of these practices is to enhance competition and Judge Will so found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.487" offset="12843641">The government here seeks to claim competition in private labels, but that is a contradiction in turn because competition in private labels, means they would no longer be private and would deprive the consumer of the competitive benefits, which they provide.</text>

            <text syncTime="3338.127" offset="13426172">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.010" offset="13445711">The government’s argument has been that the competition is not enhanced by the territorialization device for achieving exclusivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.625" offset="13484163">In very brief terms, what we are saying is that it is better to have two Topco members competing against A&amp;P in a given market or Kroger or Safeway than one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.479" offset="13527631">We do not enhance competition by erecting a barrier around the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.519" offset="13547798">Secondly, we have argued that we do have here an effect on price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.458" offset="13575487">Topco’s expert Dr. Applebaum (ph) explained the whole purpose of exclusivity is to insulate the seller from competition with respect to price and try and get as much control over price and margin as you can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.211" offset="13638495">So that exclusivity itself has an effect on price and when exclusivity is achieved by territorial agreements not to compete, that effect is aggravated because we have the third consequence of this agreement, namely something that inhibits entry into each others markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.832" offset="13705055">Now, it is argued that well there really is not any inhibition on entry into markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.414" offset="13719370">People can enter without Topco products.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.001" offset="13729714">Of course, they can enter without Topco products, as is suggested and the justification for the importance of Topco is not as great as it has been suggested, but the record is to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.833" offset="13769003">Just to use the exhibit that was referred to a moment ago at page 440, there, there is the discussion of the second line of products and it is also pointed out that at page 438 and 439, one of the reasons that there is not a demand for second line, doubtless rises from the fact that it is impracticable to stock in the same warehouse, duplicating private brand inventories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.679" offset="13920408">Now, this really means that once you are into the Topco system of distribution, so that it is your basic system, anywhere where you are operating out of your basic warehouses, you really cannot go to some other line, if you want to expand and that means you cannot walk into another Topco member's territory with a different line and in fact, that same paragraph illustrates the kind of conflict we run into here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.769" offset="14008807">The Big Bear liberal situation where neither wanted to give up the brands that the other -- the exclusivity, but and neither one of the other member having the advantages of the same brand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.175" offset="14062410">Now, this goes also to the second line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.999" offset="14069724">If you look at page 440, the explanation is given why would not members want a second line of brands and the answer is that if there were a second line, the competitive edge that Topco members gives -- the Topco programs give its members would be eliminated, that is the competitive edge they have against each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.117" offset="14146106">Now, the District Court found expressly a third factor, finding at 58 in a record at A56, it expressly found that intra brand competition is eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.659" offset="14200336">There was nothing else it could find on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.245" offset="14226668">There has been some mention here about the importance of brand loyalty as a competitive factor here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.384" offset="14251223">Now, the record on brand loyalty is that no one can determine what it is that brings the housewife in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.757" offset="14272748">It certainly is not just loyalty to a private label brand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.798" offset="14288839">People do not travel across the city to get Food Club canned peas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.875" offset="14313185">Dr. Barnes, I mean, Dr. Applebaum, the expert put on by the defendants testified that the brand loyalty factor really cannot be determined because there are not studies available to do so, this is in the record of 186 and 187.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.115" offset="14386119">A point has been made that the government did not specifically attempt to prove that this practice was anti-competitive and we did not go forward with evidence beyond enough to show that this was illegal per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.943" offset="14445470">We did, however, on the record that was made try to carry the burden to show that this practice was not unreasonable and we argued principally three things that it inhibits expansion by members into each others territory, that it affects price and that it restricts intra brand competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="3648.194" offset="14666465">Two Topco stores Meijers and Plumbs both entered each others territory, Grand Rapids, Muskegon and I think in Lansing and they began vigorously competing with each other.</text>
