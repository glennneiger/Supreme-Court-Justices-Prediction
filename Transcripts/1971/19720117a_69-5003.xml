            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="47.248" offset="263111">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.720" offset="285053">One thing I perhaps should make clear, it's our position on the question asked by Mr. Justice Stewart as to whether if there were shown today any legitimate legislative basis for a punishment that would itself in the Eighth Amendment is referring, the answer in my judgment is unmistakably no.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.895" offset="381706">The argument about whether there is a legitimate base for a legislative judgment has a very, very small part in our brief as I am sure the Court has noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.984" offset="414098">We have essentially, simply pointed out that one of the reasons why a Court need not hesitate to strike down a rare and harsh punishment like capital punishment is that it is not taking away anything that is very important to the State, both in the sense that the only thing is really an issue here is whether instead of killing 20 or 15 people randomly selected a year, they are going to keep them in prison and the impact of that from all available determiners is in current to punishment, but we do not urge that legislature could not, we do not urge in this forum at this time that the legislature could not find that there is a basis for boiling an oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.554" offset="612315">That I think really presents the question very squarely.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.650" offset="624750">Mr. George said and I think the State generally takes the position that if boiling an oil came before this Court, even though it had a legitimate legislative base, even though a legislature might find the boiling in oil was a deterrent that somehow the Court could say that that was a cruel and unusual punishment because it is “unnecessarily cruel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="163.536" offset="728299">I want to simply point out to the Court, who is arguing subjective standards here and who is arguing objective standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.806" offset="757347">How could this Court say or how could Mr. George say that boiling an oil is unnecessary if a legislature finds that in order to deter some particularly serious crime that the horrible prospect of being boiled in oil is all that we do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.538" offset="828296">I think that it is the respondents and not the petitioners who are urging the Court to react to that visceral level.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.943" offset="857866">Our proposition is I think the much more objective one.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.321" offset="867375">It looks not to what society says, but to what it does and we do not reject the fact that 41 States have it on the statutes, but that is certainly a phenomenon with which one must start, but one must also ask what did they do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.757" offset="929129">Now, let us look at this thing if we may for a moment in the world picture and we are not talking about Mozambique and Liechtenstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.197" offset="958908">We are not talking about a progressive trend which has brought virtually every nation in the western hemisphere with a possible exception of Paraguay and Chile to abolish the death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.159" offset="1962742">I do not urge that it be drawn and I see no occasion in these cases because no such statute is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.782" offset="1985311">The problem with those statutes is that we had insufficient experience with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.038" offset="2002343">The essence of our submission here, I think it is perfectly coined that we have had a very considerable experience with general statutes punishing the crime of murder or the crime of rape with death.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.391" offset="2051662">And what we find when those statutes are applied, actually applied by juries in particular cases is that almost never is the penalty of death in fact inflicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.989" offset="2098056">I think that is not an exaggeration.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.753" offset="2105161">Now, one does not know what juries would do with different kinds of statutes, but one darn well knows what the testimony of public opinion, of enlightened public opinion in this country is with regard to general statutes punishing murder with death.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.135" offset="2162631">The -- what juries do -- we are in a little disagreement with I think the respondents on the significance of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.432" offset="2215920">To start with it as we have pointed out, juries really only do return about a hundred death verdicts a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.699" offset="2240893">Now, to understand how small that is, you have to compare it with the number of crimes punishable by death.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.192" offset="2278928">It is a very difficult thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.517" offset="2284257">We have attempted to do it in one of the appendage to our brief in which you point out is that juries do not apply the death penalties perhaps to more to more than one out of 12 or 13 at the very most cases in which they could and maybe a half or a third of those people are actually executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.962" offset="2346010">Now, notice that the non-acceptance, indeed the repudiation which this imply.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.089" offset="2370461">We have a country in which 43 jurisdictions have the death penalty on the books in which hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people are prosecuted for crimes and convicted of crimes in which death penalty is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.262" offset="2431169">Under the best of circumstances for capital punishment where the -- what is involved in an execution is a secret or indefinite kind of the jury does not proceed or fully understand where the people get the death penalty, are disproportionately the pariahs, the poor and racial minorities, it's a point I want to come back to in one second, and where in addition the juries are death qualify, the juries are returning a hundred death verdicts here.</text>

            <text syncTime="975.656" offset="3976782">Now, if however the Court has any concern with any of this factual questions, for instance, from deterrence to who gets the death penalty, any of these things, an evidentiary hearing would be the proper way to resolve that matter and in the Akins case, at least the case can be taken in such a way to get that hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.675" offset="4044805">Now, the -- I would turn to this subject of rarity and discrimination because the significance of both rarity and who -- and the question, who gets the death penalty is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.938" offset="4117844">First of all, when a nation decides with a growing crime scare, burgeoning population, sentences a few people to death, were in fact sentenced to death and execute the people you fear of and does this against the background where the ideological debate where the content of this debate about capital punishment makes unmistakably clear why this is happening historically because capital punishment is regarded as indecent, as inconsistent with civilized standards today then that manifests a repudiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.645" offset="4276773">It's quite different from what is manifested by the maintenance of the statutes on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.678" offset="4304880">That is the second aspect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.007" offset="4310209">The very fact that capital punishment comes to be as rarely and is infrequently and is discriminatorily imposed as it is, takes the pressure of the legislature quite simply to do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.933" offset="4365902">For one reason why the Eighth Amendment must be measured not only by legislative disapproval, but by popular disapproval in terms of what juries and judges and prosecutors do in fact is that there are in fact more than one way to skin a cat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.490" offset="4448136">And that a penalty can be repudiated by public opinion, every bit as thoroughly by the legislatures making it optional and then nobody has ever applying it as by the legislature's repeal of it and this goes back to the Chief Justice’s question, how has it been done internationally?</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.959" offset="4513964">In some places it has been done by legislative repeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.628" offset="4524622">In other places what has happened is exactly what happened in this country, it simply falls into disputes and when it falls into disputes, when there are only a very, very few people and those predominantly poor black, personally ugly and socially unacceptable, there simply is no pressure in the legislature to take it off.</text>

            <text syncTime="1660.625" offset="6716609">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.580" offset="6732492">The question in this case is and particularly in the case now before the Court that is Furman versus Georgia involves the Fourteenth Amendment first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.145" offset="6770735">I think that petitioner has in all of these arguments and all of these cases given way to the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment hasn't anything to do with these cases and the argument is made simply that in this cruel and unusual punishment to deprive a man of his life, due process of law is not really looked that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.643" offset="6856730">However, as it affects the State that is exactly is the most important point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.618" offset="6880658">The Fourteenth Amendment provides that life, liberty that no State may deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.484" offset="6932067">Now, that was written in 1968 long after the fifth -- the Eighth and the Fifth Amendment were written.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.517" offset="6964250">So that when the restrictions was made on the State by way of the Fourteenth Amendment, the death penalty was already recognized and the restriction on the State was only that they not deprive a man of his life or liberty or property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.340" offset="7047529">And I would submit that if the Court in these instances rules that the death penalty a cruel and unusual punishment and may not be enforced by the State then it would take a constitutional amendment because the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the Fifth could be rewritten so that we would have a proposition that no State may deprive any person of life nor may any State deprive any person of liberty or property without due process of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1829.914" offset="7393808">Is it a matter of fundamental standard, is it a concept of our ordered liberty, that is where full -- that is where a punishment period comes in, I think and whether it is cruel and unusual punishment comes in to the concept of ordered liberty, a fundamental fairness and I think that so long as the State utilizes fundamental fairness in dealing with it, you know, Fifth Amendment posing penalties that those penalties may be used, particularly since the States were specifically permitted by the Fourteenth Amendment to utilize the taking of life so long as it was done with due process of law and I think that is one of the basic frailties in most of the arguments that are made by petitioner because he talks about rarity and discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1926.108" offset="7778539">What I am saying is that it comes into the restrictions on the State by way of the Due Process Clause, not that in and of itself and apart for many consideration of due process is applicable to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.807" offset="7841337">That is very clear because without the Fourteenth Amendment the Eighth Amendment would not be applicable to the States at all because that is not how it was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.781" offset="7881253">So that in the concept of due process is where the considerations of how we deal with punishment come in and I would submit that a State may impose a punishment so long as it is not out side of what we regard in our concept of ordered liberty and fundamental fairness and I think that is exactly where the standards come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.446" offset="7991907">The standards are not so close aligned that you can measure them by polls taken today or by the number of people executed within the last ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.829" offset="8029419">That is -- assume a -- close to the line as far as that concept of ordered liberty are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.381" offset="8059617">Moreover, I think that the standards that ought to be viewed are the ones that because the courts have used throughout the country in recognizing what cruel and unusual punishment means and the cases that come out of the State Courts now, the Lower Federal Court and of this Court indicate that it means barbarous or uncivilized or torturous and that type of thing and certainly the penalty of death per se does not come within that prohibition or that understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.100" offset="8210500">Mr. Justice Marshall, you asked about whether the meaning of unusual has changed, I would submit that it has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.753" offset="8241115">The meaning of unusual has not changed from the time that the Eighth Amendment was written, but the application of it perhaps has and I think, as I have said before that the death penalty itself be outside of a consideration of that measure because it specifically reserves the state in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.835" offset="8321468">However, if we are going to measure whether in our contemporary deciding, the death penalty is to be regarded as cruel an unusual punishment, I think petitioners are using the wrong guideline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.217" offset="8386983">I think there are three basic ones that are compelling with respect to what is the current sentence of this specific regard to punishment and he talked about the world community, but we do not know why these countries did waive the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.766" offset="8457200">We do not know for example whether it was the legislature or the petitioner, but even more we do not whether it was because they have regarded it as cruel and unusual punishment or for some other authority nor what the crime is what?</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.113" offset="8514565">Nor what the punishment where the crime has been displaced with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.684" offset="8532851">For example if it -- it is quite that life imprisonment, if the death penalty so much more severe that in and of itself, is grossly disproportionate as a matter of degree.</text>

            <text syncTime="2252.025" offset="9082258">Well, obviously that would be discriminatory, but that would not mean that you could not sentence anybody to 20 years imprisonment for larceny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.216" offset="9119039">It would simply mean that in no occasion where there was discriminations those sentences were invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.785" offset="9145266">Yes indeed and I think their proof falls far short of making out the kind of a prima facie case that this Court has considered in cases like (Inaudible) with regard to discrimination by virtue of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.695" offset="9216946">And -- but even if -- I say, even if they could make it out, it would not invalidate the death penalty because the same thing would apply to any other punishment when it does not make the death penalty anymore cruel and unusual than life imprisonment or 20 years in jail or even 1 day in jail is to provide that in a discriminatory manner and of course that then goes back to the Due Process Clause.</text>

            <label>Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley</label>
            <text syncTime="2324.585" offset="9372531">I think not because I do not think it has had the opportunity to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.656" offset="9388727">Mr. Amsterdam suggested that it has not had the opportunity, he has not had the opportunity to present statistics to our Courts, but that certainly is not true in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.842" offset="9429478">There was no effort made to bring any statistics or make any argument as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.619" offset="9456645">In Furman the argument was not even made in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.823" offset="9469393">It simply was stated, but no argument was made and there was a very, very short argument to point out in our brief, in the brief to the Supreme Court of Georgia, citing merely the whole statistics of how many white people and how many black people had been executed since 1930 up to 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.474" offset="9564061">But that does not prove that the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.758" offset="9585168">Moreover, those statistics which talks about the period of time since the 1930 to 1968 in Georgia case or the old, since it's the only state failed to take account of the exact changes in criminal justice that had taken place under decisions of this Court as well as the decisions of State Court so that we are safeguarding not only criminal generally, but people who are subject to the death penalty with greater due process so that when do arrive at a consideration that they are ready to be executed we are sure that they are -- it was arrived at in manner of comporting with due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.036" offset="9770324">And I think that is one of the great fallacy in utilizing the statistics with regard to the number of executions that they had then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.822" offset="9805432">How many of them have not been executed because of jury discrimination where group of jurors or illegals confessions or illegal search and seizure or something else and that has nothing to do with the penalty that was imposed by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.381" offset="9867708">But again let me just return to -- for a moment to what I regard as measurements of what the standard should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.764" offset="9901249">The standards of fundamental fairness and standards of an ordered society.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.655" offset="9924760">As I have said I think that should be the jury is the one, the juries across the country are still imposing the death penalty and certainly they are representatives of the community as stated in Williams versus New York by Mr. Justice Murphy in his dissent, in our Criminal Court the jury is the representative of the community, its voice is that of the society against which the crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.131" offset="10038653">Its verdict is a community expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.486" offset="10052133">Witherspoon also refers to the jury representative of the community and so does Trop versus Dulles and I think that it cannot be overlooked that the jury are still imposing death penalty and did in the 650 or how many other cases resulted in persons now under the death penalty offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.757" offset="10137187">They express the community feelings and standards and that was recognized in Trop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.927" offset="10157876">They speak for the community if we are going to look at what the standards are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.075" offset="10174490">In this two cases where Georgia has standings for the Court, as a matter of fact the internment in the instant case right now before the Court, there was only one person of the total panel of 48 which means one out of 49 because one has to be added who will -- said that they were so against the death penalty that they could never encourage it in any case and that it would affect their determination of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.308" offset="10279398">One out of 49, so that cannot show that there is an overwhelm -- these people are selected at random and moreover, their feet are put to the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.378" offset="10323702">There was some questions in one of the earlier arguments about, well, juries are perhaps just imposing the penalty now because they know it is not going to be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.765" offset="10365184">I would submit that if it is supposed to be, the overwhelming repudiation of the death penalty that petitioners talk about, then why would jurors take the unpopular stand in imposing a penalty which the world has repudiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.873" offset="10437595">And secondly, how can we presume that a juror sitting in the place of judgment is going to take a chance on a penalty not being imposed when he knows that his expressing as well as the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.294" offset="10499349">I would submit that no one with a conscience would do so and in certain point his arguing presumption of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.037" offset="10534249">Secondly, we speak also of the second measurements then of what -- who measures the standards and I would say, the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.529" offset="10584299">And it is particularly appropriate to look there because the jury -- the judiciary is measuring the death penalty in terms of whether it is cruel and unusual punishment not whether it is why or not whether as restriction or not whether it can be without it but is it cruel and unusual punishment and reading all those recent cases from around the country I find almost none, I find none, there are probably are some but none where the Court had declared that it is cruel and unusual punishment and talking of the State High Court and the Lower Federal Court where -- so that we have the judiciary taking this very question of whether it is cruel and unusual punishment and giving it consideration and saying in our opinion and applying the constitution, we consider that it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.262" offset="10807176">So certainly they too express the standard of decency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.851" offset="10829537">We have talked in others situations of this conscience of the Court that is for example the test that used in the (Inaudible) raised in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.764" offset="10881155">Does it check the conscience of a Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.671" offset="10888782">That is what we are talking about with regard to standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.739" offset="10897142">It is not something so close to the line that can be measured as 51% today and 49% tomorrow and that certainly is not the way in which our constitution used to be utilized or to be construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.213" offset="10967045">Again, it is the question we think for the legislature to determine certainly in Witherspoon, the Court noted that the power of a State to execute a sentence -- sentenced to death by a jury does not be -- has no bearing in what the Court does with respect to whether the State can select who the person so long as it is done with due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.114" offset="11078640">And also we would like to point out that there is in many of the cases before this Court, Allied Stores of Ohio versus Bowers to light this constitution which were in 1866 and cases since then a presumption of regularity and a presumption of constitutionality of legislative enactment and that has been overlooked I think that petitioners’ argument and position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.489" offset="11184071">He has the burden to show that the legislative enactment is unconstitutional and I think that he has done so, not with respect to the death penalty per se in the abstract which is what he contend should be declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.477" offset="11256064">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2806.734" offset="11301099">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.614" offset="11308622">We -- on one point I essentially do not disagree with Mrs. Beasley.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.471" offset="11328057">I think juries are in many ways the conscience of the community although I think other organs of government, prosecutors and judges are as well and our whole case rests on what juries and prosecutors and the other agencies of government have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.285" offset="11379257">What they have done is to refuse to impose the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.667" offset="11392841">The question then arises, well, why do we not leave them that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.353" offset="11403604">If they are refusing then why should Court step in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.948" offset="11413948">Why should not it just die of its own way?</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.195" offset="11422934">The answer to that is the case like Furman versus Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.670" offset="11436831">Where what you have is a regular garden variety, burglary, murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.987" offset="11458043">Unintended killing, somebody shot through the door, a case submitted on the theory that it was an unintended killing, there are thousands of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.930" offset="11497853">The jury comes back with death, the defendant is black, the victim is white, it is all the aggravation in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.039" offset="11526275">The State which distinguishes between torture and the mere extinguishment of human life cannot see that this case is different from the aggravated cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.282" offset="11563264">But the jury is allowed in every case to return a death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.365" offset="11575594">There are Georgia figures in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.906" offset="11581759">I do not think they are judicially noticeable but they are in this record, 33 people on death row, 27 of them of black, six whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.262" offset="11611225">The reasons why a juries cannot be permitted go on doing what they have done and slowly, inexorably do away with the death penalty themselves, is that an individual in particular cases there is going to be a regression and depending largely on the color of the defendant and in the ugliness of his person --</text>

            <text syncTime="2901.536" offset="11680293">And it is that kind of selectiveness which we think that the death penalty forbids.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.993" offset="11702131">Now, I believe the lower court cases somewhat differently than Mrs. Beasley does, I would say that the real development in the Eighth Amendment area throughout this century has been very pointedly development in the prison cases which has the Court just recognized in Haines and Kerner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.114" offset="11762631">What has happened there is that the Eighth Amendment has been taken and given a whole new meaning to respond to a new problem and new conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.761" offset="11797217">What we have in the capital punish plenary is the exactly the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.770" offset="11813204">And our point, I repeat again with regard to race is not or poverty is not discrimination, we have not proved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.726" offset="11845073">On these records, it could not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.685" offset="11852910">What I am saying is to exactly what is happening in capital punishments, the rare arbitrary, usually discriminatory but unprovably discriminatory infliction of a punishment, escapes all other kinds of constitutional control, due process, equal protection and escapes the public pressure that keep legislatures acting decently unless there is something in the constitution that degrades.</text>

            <text syncTime="2998.574" offset="12068472">We do not but I think the basis of it can be fairly simply stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.194" offset="12082892">The Court -- the concept to judicial notice is essentially that when a writing is put to there in the public domain which people may rebut, which people may study and answer that if a crime is judicially noticeable because its availability for professional criticisms makes it reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.984" offset="12162095">Now, when a State takes figures out of the State Department of Correction records, that has never been printed anywhere which was (Inaudible) is un-ascertainable, whose significance is not subject to criticisms, that is not judicially noticeable.</text>
