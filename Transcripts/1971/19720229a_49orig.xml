            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73740">Next in number 49 Original, the State of Illinois against the City of Milwaukee and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.224" offset="346563">Mr. Herzog, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="fred_f_herzog" startTime="72.423" stopTime="388.212">
            <label>Mr. Fred F. Herzog</label>
            <text syncTime="72.423" offset="363386">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.809" offset="380940">This is a motion by the State of Illinois asking this Court for a leave to file a Bill of Complaint against various Wisconsin municipalities including and foremost the city of Milwaukee which as you know quite well contains within its boundaries, the greatest concentration of people and industry in the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.983" offset="505596">Now, the Bill of Complaint is quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.698" offset="520434">It merely charges that huge amounts of raw sewage and inadequately treated sewage are dumped everyday into the waters of Lake Michigan that these waters thereby become contaminated and that these polluted waters find their way into the Illinois territory where this severely and I mean severely endanger the life and health of many residents of the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.232" offset="650628">Actually, in this particular instance, the Department of Natural Resources of the State of Wisconsin which is the agency which deals with water pollution matters in the State of Wisconsin has estimated that 200 million gallons a day, 200 million gallons a day in the Milwaukee area alone are discharged into the waters of Lake Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.325" offset="774971">Now, this is not a small matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.260" offset="786778">And it is not a small matter as we in Illinois are concerned therewith.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.114" offset="810184">We in Illinois, I must put here the matter straight in this instance have actually done everything possible to wipe out pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.267" offset="866713">Of course, there are some spots which are remaining but it was through efforts of our Attorney General who is sitting next to me here that we have accomplished that.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.869" offset="917182">And I might say here in this instance that we cannot tolerate and suffer that such an epidemic, a possible epidemic lurks behind every way which really finds its way into the Illinois region.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.994" offset="985622">We are familiar, unfortunately, in Illinois with such an epidemic.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.116" offset="1006102">In 18 -- the 1880’s, the City of Chicago dumped raw sewage into Lake Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.772" offset="1036822">The consequence was one of the severest typhoid epidemics which ever hit the City of Chicago -- having shrink the population of Chicago and it was at that time that the Chicago Sanitary District was created where the flow of the rivers as you might know is reversed and for a -- nothing goes into Lake Michigan on this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.583" offset="1144029">We have -- we are actually here in this particular instance, we have really a situation where sovereign interest clash with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.725" offset="1188542">Although the suit is filed by us performer against various Wisconsin municipalities, in reality -- in political reality and in effect it is directed against the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.509" offset="1255729">As a matter of fact, the respondents all in their briefs say and emphasize that they are controlled by the Department of Natural Resources of the State of Wisconsin which are just indicate that this -- the agency which is in charge of water pollution matters particularly those concerned in Lake Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.999" offset="1349665">Therefore, we have here, as I indicate it a clash of such sovereign interests, the municipalities and State agencies merely being the bearers of the sovereign police power of the State of Wisconsin in the field of public health.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.614" offset="1428137">Under these circumstances, I respectfully suggest that if you have such a clash of sovereign interest, the exercise of original jurisdiction approaches the constitutional mandate -- I might even say it becomes mandatory here in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.717" offset="1516535">We have an example here too, in the case of Missouri versus Illinois, although the Illinois they have -- the State of Illinois was made to perform party.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.513" offset="1567735">The real culprit if I may say so was the Chicago Sanitary District against which the complaint was levied by the State of Missouri and there reached -- original jurisdiction was exercised.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="388.212" stopTime="403.127">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="388.212" offset="1626563">Mr. Herzog, is from a pollution point of view are -- is the way that Waukegan and Wilmington when that they have to handle their raw sewage materially different from the way that Kenosha and Racine, Milwaukee handle theirs?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="fred_f_herzog" startTime="403.127" stopTime="578.832">
            <label>Mr. Fred F. Herzog</label>
            <text syncTime="403.127" offset="1686227">Yes, they handle it presently different.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.515" offset="1695735">First of all, as far as we made this concern, it belongs to the matter to the area of the Chicago Metropolitan Sanitary District.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.014" offset="1729694">Hence, their extensive treatment is provided and it doesn’t go into Lake Michigan but as far as Waukegan is concerned and to the communities in the North Shore Sanitary District, they are presently under orders of our Pollution Control Board, the Foul Water Control -- Pollution Control Board not to emit any sewage into Lake Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.710" offset="1828542">So, they do handle it differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.850" offset="1837110">As I said, due to our efforts and the persistent efforts which we have made in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.338" offset="1866994">Now, being here, a clash of inter-controversy involving sovereign interest, I have indicated that really original jurisdiction is almost mandatory in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.666" offset="1944316">However, even if they alleviate form or the substance in this instance and say, “Well, the complaint is really not directed officially against the State of Wisconsin.”</text>
            <text syncTime="480.913" offset="1997293">Nevertheless, I can only reemphasize again that these State agencies and these municipal corporations and I might say that one of the agency is actually a state agency namely the Milwaukee --the Sewerage Commission of the County of Milwaukee where they may emphasize appointed by the governor of the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.129" offset="2098230">But as I said, even if he looked at these municipalities, nevertheless, they are the bearers of sovereign interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.169" offset="2134383">They carry out within their territory the police power of the State of Wisconsin in the field of public health.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.530" offset="2167820">The question has been asked by this Court, “If the Court exercises jurisdiction, what law would apply?”</text>
            <text syncTime="532.979" offset="2205645">Well, we submit here that Federal Common Law must apply in such an instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.041" offset="2233858">It must apply because the mere idea of sovereignty demands the application of such a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.625" offset="2272205">It cannot be a State law although maybe the Federal Court here can freely draw from state resources of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.445" offset="2311493">About the law which is applied is Federal Law -- a Federal Law which has to take into consideration the equality of the sovereigns which are involved and has to take into consideration the backdrop of various Federal Laws which will come into play.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="578.832" stopTime="587.717">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="578.832" offset="2389025">Mr. Herzog, is Congress free to specify the law or to fashion the law applicable in a suit like this?</text>

            <label>Mr. Fred F. Herzog</label>
            <text syncTime="587.717" offset="2424551">A Congress is free and about to -- I’m sorry to say that the entire Bill both laid on Congressional Report here, in this instance, that Congress has actually delegated the power here to the various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.781" offset="2496858">As far as what the quality standards are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.399" offset="2511278">Thankfully, in my humble opinion, this is a drawback in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.920" offset="2529355">That it is left to the individual states to control even water pollution and to control it where actually in these interstate disputes, there are sovereign interests clash with each other.</text>

            <text syncTime="628.692" offset="2588496">Are we -- is this Court free despite the decision of Congress to leave this matter to the State and ourselves to fashion a federal standard that would govern this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="644.111" offset="2650145">No, Mr. Justice White, I really believe here in this instance that under the constitutional mandate of Article 3 where the Court must really hear controversies which are in effect between states, this Court must fashion its own law and cannot --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="661.805" stopTime="663.581">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="661.805" offset="2720884">Regardless of what Congress said?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="fred_f_herzog" startTime="663.581" stopTime="679.731">
            <label>Mr. Fred F. Herzog</label>
            <text syncTime="663.581" offset="2727990">Irregardless here in this instance of Congress an overwriting law of Congress which says that in this instance, Federal -- certain Federal Principles must be applied which hasn’t been the case here.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="679.731" stopTime="701.991">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="679.731" offset="2792564">And if Congress said that Federal Laws could govern cases like this but this Court should borrow State Law in deciding the case, would you be bound to follow that direction?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="fred_f_herzog" startTime="701.991" stopTime="718.843">
            <label>Mr. Fred F. Herzog</label>
            <text syncTime="701.991" offset="2881694">Well, I -- indeed in this instance, frankly I question where the Congress can tell this Court what law to apply in cases of original jurisdiction to be decided on the Article three of the Constitution.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="718.843" stopTime="725.689">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="718.843" offset="2949090">Let’s assume that it can, just for the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.838" offset="2961002">Let’s just assume that it can, it has it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="fred_f_herzog" startTime="725.689" stopTime="822.483">
            <label>Mr. Fred F. Herzog</label>
            <text syncTime="725.689" offset="2976467">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.386" offset="2983258">It hasn’t clearly acted in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.478" offset="2991618">It hasn’t clearly as far as the Federal Law is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.332" offset="3011053">It is left to the individual states really the resolution of the problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.818" offset="3036966">And it provided eventually if a state asks for an interstate enforcement conference and there it wasn’t said what law should be applied here, or what rule should be applied in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.143" offset="3098302">So, it was all left up hanging in the air and thankfully, this is a whole drawback of these interstate enforcement conferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.289" offset="3130798">They haven’t worked and I will indicate why they haven’t work.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.839" offset="3153054">But be that does it may, we respectfully submit here that this is a complete -- this is really the controversy between sovereigns as I have repeatedly mentioned that the controversy here in this instance which really pertains to the use of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.943" offset="3233511">And if we have such a controversy pertaining to the use of water, Mr. Justice Brandeis here speaking for this Court in the Hinderlider case which we have quoted in our brief said the following: “For whether the water of an interstate stream must be apportioned between the two states as accretion of federal common law upon which neither the statutes nor the decisions of either state can be conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.086" offset="3362034">Now --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="822.483" stopTime="827.200">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="822.483" offset="3363601">He was speaking there of course of the statutes of the state not of federal statutes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="fred_f_herzog" startTime="827.200" stopTime="1226.825">
            <label>Mr. Fred F. Herzog</label>
            <text syncTime="827.200" offset="3382514">Correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.602" offset="3388052">But to that, there is another point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.061" offset="3397978">It refers here characteristically his authority to this case of New Jersey versus New York in which actually that -- it was really New York City in which actually New York City dumped its garbage into the ocean and there the garbage was deposited if there was an ill wind on the shores of the State of New Jersey and there were federal laws in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.937" offset="3517410">They were -- walked on the Harbors Act of 1899 was at this time in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.051" offset="3541861">The Rivers and Harbors Act was in existence and actually the Harbor mess of New York at that time gave to the City of New York the expressed permission to dumped in that places where they dumped.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.451" offset="3595464">Nevertheless here, this Court took a jurisdiction and this Court decided here in this particular instance that the action was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.304" offset="3642902">I might say here that much is made by the defendants of the fact here.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.826" offset="3669025">That there is that Federal Water Quality Act of 1965 or the Federal Water Pollution Control Act which provides for an enforcement conference and the -- a remedy by the Attorney General of the United States if requested by the Administrator originally by the Secretary of the Interior, now by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.242" offset="3774664">First of all, let me emphasize that this remedy is not the remedy which is even to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.956" offset="3797547">It is a remedy which is solely in the discretion of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.974" offset="3817609">And during 22 years, there was one single case where the Attorney General actually utilized that remedy, apparently, wasn’t asked here either by the Secretary of the Interior or by the Administrator of the Environmental Agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.642" offset="3888244">And what did this administrator say about the effectiveness of that remedy which is supposedly and allegedly provided here in the Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.695" offset="3936519">This simply state that you didn’t -- it didn’t work at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.191" offset="3950416">We have pointed it out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.250" offset="3962641">I want to quote in a letter to Representative Albert, the speaker of the House, he said, “These major score of pollution control of interstate waters have not proved sufficiently strong and and affect people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="991.069" offset="4037978">Now, we are not really the persons who say that these remedies have not proven effective, it was the U.S. Senate, who so held on November 2, 1971, that the barely three months ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.914" offset="4097329">There on November 2, when they passed unanimously 86 to nothing, the new act, the house hasn’t take to ban it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.083" offset="4134004">They are the Committee on Public Works after two years of study of the Federal Water Pollution Control, go over them and I’m quoting, “concludes that the national effort to abate and control water pollution is inadequate in every vital aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.486" offset="4207670">Rivers, lakes and streams are being used to dispose of man’s waste rather than to support man’s life and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.579" offset="4244032">And the use of any river, lakes, stream or ocean as a waste treatment system is unacceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.509" offset="4271722">And they said this was due to the time schedules for abatement are slipping away, because of failure to enforce lack of effluent controls and disputes over federal state standards.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.848" offset="4329087">This is a work, I might say of Senator Muskie who reported here this Bill in behalf of the Committee on Public Works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.540" offset="4363882">Now, what are the effects hereof the Michigan and State Enforcement Conference?</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.779" offset="4384780">It was the State of Illinois as the only state which in 1967 asked for that convening of that conference because we were eventually afraid of these wastes which come every day into the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.127" offset="4454161">We were afraid because all our efforts would be set to not and would be futile if we couldn’t act here in this instance against the neighboring states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.804" offset="4496898">And therefore, we asked for the convening of the conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.812" offset="4516960">This is unlike, I might say, Ohio versus Wyandotte where there was at Lake Erie Conference which was in existence only for one year before the suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.472" offset="4559591">In 1968, the first conference met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.671" offset="4572339">There were high sounding declarations of that -- the state should cooperate in the pollution control abatement programs, deadlines were set, operations schedules provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.253" offset="4630749">But what came of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.226" offset="4638586">In 1969, the second conference met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.273" offset="4654782">And again there were broken deadlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.142" offset="4666276">Some of the municipalities didn’t even start.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.710" offset="4680486">As a matter of fact, one of the municipalities here involved has a 1967 deadline to the goal to enlarge their sewage treatment facilities, it has still not complied with these schedules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.982" offset="4745583">In 1970, the third conference met and it meant significantly in the City of Milwaukee because the Chairman of the Conference who is a federal official turns to the Representative of the State of Wisconsin and I’m quoting what he said, “But the point is that the biggest city in US state, Milwaukee wounded discharges into Lake Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.990" offset="4853626">The water that we have a real high priority to protect is in clear violation of this conference recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.357" offset="4891138">They are more than two years late on disinfection of the effluent and the lack of putting out this disinfection means that pathogens go into the lake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.256" offset="4942756">Now, these are the bold facts as I see them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.009" offset="4957698">The largest city in this state is not disinfecting its effluent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1266.451" offset="5139510">I think it is Section 7 of the Administrative Review Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="1271.448" offset="5159467">As a matter of fact, we have no remedy under the State Law unlike Ohio versus Wyandotte.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.403" offset="5183291">We could not go into the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.085" offset="5194053">Yes, we could sue them under a long-armed statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.966" offset="5205547">How are we going to enforce particularly in an injunctive decree against Milwaukee, against the sovereign agencies of another state?</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.895" offset="5249224">Yes, they recognize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.224" offset="5254553">It’s the same is to -- with the Federal Court, we do not qualify as a citizen under the diversity proceedings which is recognized also by this Court in the Wyandotte case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.883" offset="5301260">We could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.838" offset="5305022">Yes, we could go as suggested and I can only take this suggestion almost that procedures that we should go to the Department of Natural Resources of Wisconsin and ask for a relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.793" offset="5356849">This is if you would say here, the sheep should go to the wolf and ask here to meet our justice amongst them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.508" offset="5387673">This is the very person, these are the various agencies which tolerate that condition here and what did about -- by the way as far as the enforcement conference is concerned, what did Wisconsin save in the conference may emphasize, but you have changed these deadlines unilaterally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.139" offset="5466249">They said, “Well, it’s true, we did so but we consulted the Federal Water Quality Administration and then they say here, and this is characteristic, this is a quotation from their report to the conference, “It should be further noted that there are no published rules or regulations or guidelines that have been promulgated by the Department of the Interior to give specific guidelines and details on how this whole area of joint enforcement of standards and recommendations should be administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.985" offset="5609609">We consider the lack of such rule to be a substantial weakness in conference procedures.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.360" offset="5635105">That’s their own words!</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.223" offset="5642628">They really denigrate here the whole procedure as such and nothing is left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.745" offset="5668646">If it please this Court here, this is not the question as I have said of property, this is a question literally and this is not high-sounding oratory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.308" offset="5710964">This is a question of human lives which are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.800" offset="5724862">We might be saying, we are equally concern or the lives of the citizens of Wisconsin but we have noted about these humane concern for the Wisconsin residents cannot be translated by us into redirection but it can be translated by us into redirection as far as residents of the State of Illinois are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.565" offset="5815977">And we are under a duty under Federal Water Quality Act, places a responsibility for action foremost in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.734" offset="5856623">This is a constant theme of the Federal Water Quality Act in the policy statement and even in the statement where -- which deals with the enforcement provisions, which deals with the conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.038" offset="5909809">There it says, “State actions shall not be displaced by an action of the federal government unless the Court do what they have been issued and of course, never been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.511" offset="5951709">So, under these circumstances, where there is no other remedy available to us, at least no other reasonable remedy and where we surely are not going to subject our sovereign interest to an administrative agency of the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.781" offset="6028822">And where sovereign interest clash, I must respectfully submit that the exercise of original jurisdiction is the only thing which is left.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.027" offset="6073753">Everyday which goes by cause to see irreparable harm and to postpone the deadlines simply would not do anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.534" offset="6115862">We have waited three years, four years, now five years and by the way the situation still hasn’t been corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.092" offset="6154106">In the latest brief of the Milwaukee Sewerage Commission on page six, at the bottom of the page, they talked of one of their treatment plants, let’s say primary treatment is operative of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.943" offset="6217427">You know what this means in the parlance of the health authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.948" offset="6237489">Primary treatments means that the solids merely are taken out which is nothing --absolutely nothing -- as far as health is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.108" offset="6278135">Secondary treatment is demanded when at least 90% -- 85% or 90% of the solids are removed and nowadays, we have recognized that even secondary treatment in many instances is not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.974" offset="6341560">I respectfully urge this Court here to exercise jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.484" offset="6367578">Unlike Wyandotte versus Ohio, this is not where a private individuals are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.183" offset="6394432">This is a suit between sovereigns and unlike Wyandotte, no other remedy at least attach it to remedy is available to the State of Illinois which will prevent the irreparable harm.</text>

            <text syncTime="1649.826" offset="6673002">The only deadline that I’m aware of Mr. Chief Justice is the deadline that was promulgated by the State Department of Natural Resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.333" offset="6707066">I believe that was promulgated in 1970 and they reviewed this situation in an impartial, not controversial partisan manner and determined that the City of Milwaukee shall have until 1977 to make these broad and overwhelming changes in the sewer system and in the manner of handling sewage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.547" offset="6803928">And I should like to state here that the State Department of Natural Resources is created under Wisconsin Statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.893" offset="6833289">It is a quasi-judicial body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.006" offset="6845724">It is impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.619" offset="6852202">It has the same respect for Illinois as it does for Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.203" offset="6870488">And this body had promulgated orders after making findings and has said what I’ve just stated mainly that we shall have until 1977 to make these effective changes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1725.364" offset="6975187">And I should also like to state that this conference came about in 1967, the governor -- the then governor of Illinois asked for this conference from the United States Secretary of Interior and this conference was called and you have four participating states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.788" offset="7040806">You had Michigan, Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.705" offset="7052509">And they all came under cooperative basis to effectuate a remedy for this important problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1811.574" offset="7320003">I think it also demonstrates very effectively that the great pressing circumstances which have been dramatically displayed here today are not exactly in that sense but let me get to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.538" offset="7375800">What is involved in this correction procedure?</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.115" offset="7390116">The direction of this order of the case is that the City of Milwaukee would have to separate its combined sanitary and storing sewerage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.464" offset="7431493">Now, this as we understand from our own engineering estimates and we think they’re fair would take overall approximately a half of billion dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.302" offset="7470886">$300 million would have to come from local taxation; $200 million would have to come from property owners who would have to make the necessary and essential improvements that compliment that which the City of Milwaukee does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.790" offset="7520832">Now, it does not take any stretch of the imagination that no municipality today or perhaps in the immediate future is going to be in the position to formulate a financial program that is going to permit these overwhelming expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.628" offset="7576212">We’re doing our job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.697" offset="7580496">We’re trying to meet the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.587" offset="7588019">But how do you waive $300 million to local taxations when you are already burdened with the day-to-day operations of your own municipal government and with the social programs essential to vary -- to a number of people in order to carry on your municipal operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.590" offset="7656042">So, when you look at that situation and recognize that that type of money and the burden of doing the mechanical work itself and the necessary manpower which will accomplish it is so great; I must respectfully suggest Mr. Chief --Mr. Justice that 1977 does not appear to be unreasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2586.966" offset="10421573">About these huge expenditures of money, let me quote only here one instance from the conference, the third conference which took place in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.821" offset="10472982">There the question arose how much it would cost to disinfect the sewage, meaning get the bacteria out, the deadly bacteria out from the sewage?</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.888" offset="10521257">And the man that have presented the Department of Natural Resources said, six million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.584" offset="10556052">Where one all the conferees said, “My God!</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.639" offset="10568277">Six million dollars and you don’t do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.497" offset="10583637">And Mr. Stein, who was in charged of the conference said, “Yes, and who has to be spending it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.612" offset="10620104">That is the point Mr. Fenger (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.912" offset="10629299">If the people in the area feel perfectly comfortable paying $30.00 a month for an electric bill and $20.00 a month for a telephone bill and get excited when they have to pay five or six dollars for a water bill and treat their effluent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.174" offset="10698367">We are going to still being troubled and this is a basic problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2673.243" offset="10766703">But Illinois just bought it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.439" offset="10775480">$750 million for the cleaning up of everything for -- while trying to get air and water pollution cleaned up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.673" offset="10816336">$750 million -- it seems to me that six million dollars is not too high a price in this instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2721.345" offset="10959069">Here I might emphasize again there is no other possibility and the damage, we cannot wait frankly until 1977.</text>
