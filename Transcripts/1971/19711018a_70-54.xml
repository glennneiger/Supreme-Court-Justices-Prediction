            <text syncTime="24.595" offset="172055">Mr. Reeves.</text>

            <label>Mr. W. Boyd Reeves</label>
            <text syncTime="26.103" offset="178115">Mr. Justice Douglas, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.823" offset="188982">The issue presented in this case is whether a vessel of warranty of seaworthiness extends to a forklift machine which is operated explicitly upon the dock by an operator who does go aboard the vessel and who is injured by reason of some defect or fault in the lift machine as opposed to any part of the vessel, its gear or personnel causing the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.135" offset="322207">The facts of this case are not in serious dispute and are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.374" offset="343209">The respondent Bill Law who was an employee, a petitioner, Gulf Stevedore Corporation, was operating a forklift machine on the dock moving a cargo of airplane landing match from the dockside storage point to a point approximately –- to a point along side the vessel where he would put them down and they would subsequently be loaded on board the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.690" offset="464417">When Mr. Law was approximately 50 feet away from the vessel on the dock, the overhead protection rack or as the longshoreman commonly referred to it as the headache rack became loose and struck him on the back of his head.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.270" offset="534739">Now, there is no question but none of the vessel’s gear or its equipment or cargo caused the rack become loose.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.523" offset="571728">It fell because of some defect within the rack.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.668" offset="588342">However, the District Court did not consider whether it was defective or not to be determitive or material to the question presented because after Mr. Law’s deposition was taken, all parties moved for summary judgment in their flavor.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.482" offset="655634">The vessel and stevedore that was impleaded by the vessel and also the plaintiff, longshoreman himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.065" offset="685936">The District Court granted the summary judgment motion of the vessel and of the stevedore and denied the motion of plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.321" offset="727000">And on appeal, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal reversed and held that Mr. Law was in the service of the vessel that the lift machine was in fact in appurtenance of the vessel although it was not used on the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.300" offset="790843">And that Mr. Law was therefore entitled to the warranty of seaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.310" offset="810906">Now, the Appellate Court made no consideration of the extension of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act and as the respondent has pointed out in this brief, this issue was not raised in the Court of Appeals until the time of oral argument and then again after the ruling in the petition for a rehearing which was denied by the Lower Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.094" offset="906096">One of the reasons it was not raised was because of some question as to exactly what the extension of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.216" offset="942563">The -- after briefs were filed in this case in the Fifth Circuit and before the Court’s opinion came out, this Court decided Nacirema Operating Company versus Johnson which admittedly was concerned with the question of whether the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act extended to an injury which occurred on the dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.595" offset="1028035">There the Court discussed the Extension Act and said that there is much to be said but a uniform treatment of longshoreman injured while loading or unloading the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.869" offset="1081116">But even construing the Extension Act to amend the Longshoreman’s Act would not affect this result since the longshoreman injured on the pier by pier-based equipment would still remain outside the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.162" offset="1134301">Now, in Gutierrez versus Waterman, this Court also considered the Extension Act and concluded there that there was maritime jurisdiction under the act when the ship owner committed a tort while the ship was being unloaded and the impact of that tort was still ashore, at the time and place not remote from the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.816" offset="1228969">If the Court will remember, Gutierrez involved defective containers, their bean bags was permitted, beans to be spilled out onto the dock as they were being discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.644" offset="1292290">The Court concluded that the act of the vessel was its defective cargo containers and this was felt ashore and caused the injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.454" offset="1343490">That case is understandable, but in our case, the vessel played no part in the plaintiff’s injury as he was injured solely on the dock by this shore-based equipment which never went aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.098" offset="1418096">Now, there is one question and I will get into this as part of the other argument as to -- if in fact the lift machine became an appurtenance of the vessel, if in fact it was defective, then would it not come on to the Extension Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.374" offset="1479222">I submit to the Court that this lift machine never became an appurtenance of this vessel or severally there is a -- well, let me back up just for minute because the Fifth Circuit said that the lift machine became an appurtenance of the vessel relying on this Court’s decisions of Alaska Steamship Company versus Petterson.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.628" offset="1592176">Whereas where this Court held that when the stevedore brings equipment aboard the vessel to be used in the discharging, the loading operation, it becomes an integral part of the ship’s equipment and if it is defective then the vessel was responsible for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.500" offset="1659676">Alright, subsequent Lower Court decisions, the Deffes versus Federal Barge Lines case out of the Fifth Circuit held that a marine leg that was shore based and ran into a barge, if it was defective, then that made the barge defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.749" offset="1724669">The Ninth Circuit in Huff versus Matson, the Third Circuit in Spann versus Lauritzen has held similarly.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.306" offset="1762912">But in all of those cases, there was involved gantries or conveyors or (Inaudible) or something that connected the vessel with the shore-based equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.870" offset="1813172">In our case, there was nothing to connect the lift machine with the vessel.</text>

            <text syncTime="641.130" offset="2638223">The Court said that he was in service of the ship but the forklift machine that was used entirely within the warehouse was an appurtenance of the vessel and relying on this case, held and also the Fifth Circuit case of Chagois versus Lykes Bros. held that he was within the warranty and extended to them the warrant.</text>

            <label>Mr. W. Boyd Reeves</label>
            <text syncTime="782.601" offset="3204035">But now as the Court can see under the decision of Victory Law, of Victory Carriers versus Bill Law, the vessel assumes a passive secondary role in extending this seaworthiness warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.984" offset="3273626">Conceivably a vessel not even yet at the dock could be held unseaworthy, if these men are out moving the cargo in preparation for the loading of the vessel or if the vessel has already left and they are still moving the cargo from the dock into the warehouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.186" offset="3350426">The Court has simply pushed the vessel aside and really in this case, I respectfully submit the vessel’s only association with this accident was the fact that she lay along side the pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.981" offset="3401626">Now, there is the one other question of was Mr. Law in the service of the ship?</text>
            <text syncTime="836.982" offset="3421583">I respectfully submit there is no justification for extending the strict and rigid standard of seaworthiness to persons similarly situated as respondent Mr. Law in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.280" offset="3474768">The Appellate Court found that he was intimately involved in loading process and was subjected to the perils and the households of the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.579" offset="3511967">In Mahnich versus Southern Steamship Company, this Court said the justification for the rigid standard of seaworthiness as to a seaman, let us say, through blue going to a sea seaman, he subject to the rigorous discipline of the sea and all the conditions of this service constrain him to accept without critical examination and without protest working conditions and appliances as commanded by his superior officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.197" offset="3634429">This was the reason given for, or the justification for setting a strict, rigid standard of unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.370" offset="3671209">And Sieracki, where the seaworthiness warranty was given to the longshoreman who was aboard, loading and unloading.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.428" offset="3707363">The Court said that loading and unloading was within the perils and hazards to which a seaman works for.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.332" offset="3730977">But here, this respondent in driving this forklift truck on the dock was no more subjected to the perils and hazards of the sea than any forklift operator in any warehouse in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.701" offset="3796492">Is he just happened to be one step closer to the movement of this cargo, he would move it one point where it would be set down and subsequently loaded aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.584" offset="3860022">Those individuals who are operating forklift machines in other locations, in other warehouses have certainly not been extended any shield of protection similar to the shield given to longshoreman on board vessels or to seaman who are subjected to the hazards and perils of the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.398" offset="3947271">Now, we do not contend that Mr. Law was not performing some service for this vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.750" offset="3968692">But he was performing normal service for this vessel than enumerable other people, would perform to prepare a vessel for her voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.320" offset="4002964">I believe this is what the District Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.611" offset="4012159">And also the District Court said that somewhere there had to be a beginning to this loading process and somewhere there had to be an ending.</text>
