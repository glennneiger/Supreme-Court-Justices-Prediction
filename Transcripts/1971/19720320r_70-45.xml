            <label>Mr. Erwin Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="79.595" offset="392114">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.148" offset="406325">This case is here on reargument.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.203" offset="422521">It is a direct appeal from a decision of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia dismissing an indictment on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.350" offset="483125">The indictment appears beginning on page 1 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.342" offset="511024">It consists of nine counts or ten counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.274" offset="534743">The odd numbered ones of which relate to the defendant former Senator Brewster.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.631" offset="564209">The even numbered counts are not before the Court at all and the first count may be taken as for the purposes of this appeal as typical of the rest raising the question which was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.386" offset="639233">The first allegation in the account is that at all times here after mentioned in this indictment, Daniel B. Brewster was a public official that is a member of the Senate of the Untied States from the State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.899" offset="697329">And then over on page 2 of the indictment are the principal allegation of the first count is that Daniel B. Brewster being a public official, acting for and on behalf thereof directly and indirectly corruptly as solicited, sought, accepted, received and agreed to receive the sum of $5,000.00 for himself and for an entity in return for being influenced in his performance of official acts in respect to his action, route and decision on postage rate legislation which might at any time be pending before him in his official capacity and in his place of trust and profit in violation of Section 201 (c) (1) and 2, Title 18, United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.608" offset="948105">After the indictment was found, defendant through his counsel filed a motion to dismiss the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.906" offset="981332">In fact two motions dismissed, but the only one that’s here is the one which appears on page 8 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.376" offset="1015187">And the motion to dismiss, the odd numbered counts of the indictment was on the ground that in each such count, the defendant is charged with being influenced in his performance of official acts in his capacity as a United States Senator.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.676" offset="1092405">And then finally the third reason of the motion to dismiss each count of the indictment as charged against this defendant violates the provision of Article 1, Section 6 of the United States Constitution which is the Speech and Debate Clause which it will be remembered, said in in rather simple terms that for any speech or debate in either House Senators or Representatives shall not be questioned in any other place.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.185" offset="1238377">The language, the important language here is, in a speech or debate in either House.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.067" offset="1273904">And then the order of the Court from which this appeal is taken appears on page 34 of the appendix ordered that the defendant's motion be granted and the indictment be and hereby is dismissed as to the defendant Brewster for the reason stated orally by the Court at the hearing on October 9, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.605" offset="1380065">And those reasons appear on the preceding page, page 33 where the Court said, “Gentleman, based on the facts of this case, it is admitted by the Government that the five counts of the indictment which charge Senator Brewster relate to the acceptance of bribes in connection with the performance of a legislative function by a Senator of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="353.910" offset="1489362">Now I suggest that that’s simply a paraphrase of exactly what the indictment says.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.620" offset="1516111">And then it is the opinion of the Court that the immunity under the Speech and Debate Clause of the constitution, particularly in view of the interpretation given that clause by the Supreme Court in Johnson’s shields Senator Brewster, constitutionally shields him from any prosecution for alleged bribery to perform a legislative act.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.068" offset="1625930">The question of the jurisdiction of this appeal has been deferred to the hearing of the merits of -- I find it myself somewhat difficult to see that there is doubt as to the jurisdiction of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.590" offset="1708059">This arises under the old version of the Criminal Appeal’s Act, since the indictment was found here before January 1971 and it seems to us that this appeal comes under two of the clauses of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.701" offset="1800532">There is a suggestion in Mr. Ramsey’s brief that for some reason the statute is not applicable because of a reference to a conference memorandum which was said to be before the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.626" offset="1856225">It is not in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.776" offset="1868764">I have never seen it.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.325" offset="1879004">I would like to suggest that with respect to it that there is no procedure for summary judgment in the rules of criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.645" offset="1920278">I think that there is a sort of spillover here because we're familiar with the summary judgment and the rules of civil procedure that this is in some way a decision on a summary judgment, but I know of no procedure and the rules of criminal procedure for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.054" offset="2005855">And then I would like to suggest and Mr. Ramsey says that this was the equivalent of an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.865" offset="2033127">I would like to point out that no jury had been impaneled, no trial had been commenced, and I would like to suggest that as far as anything that I have heard of in the law of criminal procedure, so far there cannot be an acquittal, except at a trial that is until a jury has been impaneled.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.932" offset="2141378">Now, this becomes a little complicated in the case of a trial without jury, but I still suggest that there cannot be an acquittal without a trial that is that the commencement of trial without a jury is a rather formal act, likely impaneling of a jury and requires among other things that the right to trial by jury has been waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.120" offset="2242211">There was no such waiver here and there was no trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.073" offset="2265930">There cannot be double jeopardy until there has been jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.454" offset="2287455">I hear no jury had been empanelled and jeopardy had not attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.567" offset="2311905">I would like--in closing the jurisdictional part of my argument to refer to decisions of this Court, which are not cited in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.245" offset="2354642">One of them, the first of them is cited in an early brief of Mr. Ramsey, though for another point.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.340" offset="2383063">That is the case of United States against Fruehauf in 365 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.070" offset="2409917">Where the situation is almost exactly parallel to that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.004" offset="2429665">There had been memoranda before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.150" offset="2446279">There was a direct appeal to this Court under the Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.045" offset="2465819">If the position taken now by Mr. Ramsey is correct, even assuming that the conference memorandum to which he refers is a part of the record here that appeal should have been dismissed on the ground that there had been a decision under summary judgment or an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.284" offset="2550769">That the decision -- not only that appeal, not only was not dismissed, but the case was sent back to the District Court for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.826" offset="2589012">And then another case which is not cited in our brief, but it is so closely parallel that I think it is appropriate to mention in here, United States against Halseth, that is 342 U.S. 277, where it appeared that there had been stipulation in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.030" offset="2681799">And there again, if the decision of the Court with respect to that stipulation had amounted to an acquittal or a decision on a summary judgment, the appeal should have been dismissed, but the appeal was not dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.139" offset="2742194">Both of these cases are discussed in Mr. Justice Harlan’s opinion in the United States against Sisson in 399 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.126" offset="2786185">But I would point out that the Sisson case is clearly inapplicable here because there had been a full trial and the judges’ decision which amounted to the entry of a judgment, not withstanding the verdict was based on facts which appeared at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.874" offset="2869150">Thus, jeopardy had attached and the basis for an appeal was removed as was held in the Simmons case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.741" offset="2916692">Now, turning to the merits here, the case is of course the step beyond the Court’s decision in United States against Johnson which was decided some six years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.539" offset="3007807">The appellee relies on the Johnson decision, but I think that it is by its own terms inapplicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.105" offset="3062142">With the benefit of hindsight, one can say that the Johnson case was an unfortunate case to bring before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.210" offset="3106550">The charge there was under the conspiracy statute which is a very general statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.938" offset="3137479">While the charge here is under a bribery statute, one which with respect to Congressmen and Senators has a continuous history going back to 1853, 119 years during which time Congress has expressly said that when a Congressman or a Senator accepts a bribe, he should be subject to prosecution through the regular procedures of the criminal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.503" offset="3283661">But in the Johnson case as well, not much concern was given about the Speech or Debate Clause in initiating the prosecution or in carrying it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.000" offset="3357639">In that case, the indictment contained a specific reference to the Speech and Debate Clause which was quoted at some length in the Court’s opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.575" offset="3423990">This is on page 184 and paragraph 15 of the indictment said it was party said conspiracy that the said Thomas F. Johnson should render services for compensation to whip the making of a speech defending the operations of Maryland Saving Loan Associations and so on.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="860.215" offset="3514583">Mr. Solicitor General, do you recall whether in the Johnson case, there was a motion in the Trial Court challenging the indictment on that specific ground?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_griswold" startTime="869.797" stopTime="1104.807">
            <label>Mr. Erwin Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="869.797" offset="3552826">I do not recall Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.349" offset="3567037">I do not believe that it appears anywhere in the opinion of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.933" offset="3581456">I have not searched through the record as to what was done in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.440" offset="3607474">Not only was this in the indictment, but at the trial itself, some 50 pages of the transcript related to the speech in the case presented by the Government and having been so opened up by the Government, there was much more about the speech in the presentation of the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.967" offset="3701515">The government introduced a copy of the speech in evidence and devoted substantial argument to the preposition that the nature of the conspiracy was that the speech should be delivered in order that it could be reprinted and distributed among appropriate persons in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.038" offset="3809871">Now, with respect to the Johnson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.581" offset="3823977">It is very significant that the opinion was narrowly guarded on page 184 of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.130" offset="3878207">The Court said, "Whatever room the constitution may allow for such factors in the context of a different kind of prosecution."</text>
            <text syncTime="961.152" offset="3918332">And this of course is a bribery prosecution, not a conspiracy prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.699" offset="3940483">And then on page 185, the Court said, "We emphasize that our holding is limited to prosecutions involving circumstances as those presented in the case before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.610" offset="3988131">We expressly leave open for consideration when the case arises a prosecution which though possibly entailing inquiry in the legislative acts on motivations is founded upon a nearly drawn statute passed by Congress in the exercise of its legislative power to regulate the conduct of its members."</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.365" offset="4099099">Then I think it’s not irrelevant to point out those three members of the Court, Chief Justice Warren and Justices Douglas and Brennan concurred only in the limited holding of the Court that the use of the Congressman speech during this particular trial within examination into its authorship, motivation and content, it was violative of the speech or debate clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.127" offset="4226158">Two members of the Court took no part in the case, so that there were only four Justices who concurred in anything broader than the limited holding referred to in Chief Justice Warren’s opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.193" offset="4302436">Now, there’s nothing like this in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.289" offset="4318841">There is no speech at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.582" offset="4332007">Indeed as I’ve indicated, there’s no evidence before the Court, there was no examination into the authorship, motivation and content of any speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.297" offset="4394910">There is a reference in each count to the effect that Senator Brewster is charged with taking a bribe and I quote “In return for being influenced in his performance of official acts in respect of to his action, vote and decision on postage rate legislation.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1162.274" offset="4722798">I find it hard to see how he can complain that he is being questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.845" offset="4745055">I would think certainly under the Johnson case, it is clear that the Government cannot maintain the prosecution if it relies directly on the giving of a speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.506" offset="4799703">There is some reference in the opinion to tangential use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.989" offset="4817675">I do not quite know just what tangential use means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.712" offset="4840558">I would think that it might perhaps be within that language if it were shown that there was a speech, but if the text of the speech was not relied on and if the motivation and authorship of the speech were not gone into.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.318" offset="4914955">But I would suggest Mr. Chief Justice that this indictment at this stage can be sustained without answering these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.008" offset="4957692">I don’t know just where the line is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.403" offset="4971275">I know that the constitution says speech or debate in either House and I don’t think that is broad enough or ought to be held to be broad enough to cover things which occur outside of sessions of the house which might be construed to include sessions of committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.559" offset="5055912">Committee may be for this purpose is something done in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.771" offset="5080781">It doesn’t say both, but I am troubled about vote and there are opinions of the Court which have indicated, though I do not think actually decided that vote may be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.651" offset="5132294">But this indictment charges him of receiving a bribe for being influenced in his performance of official acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.295" offset="5182867">In respect to his action, vote and decision, on postage rate legislation or I suppose we strikeout votes, supposed we say that can’t be referred to, I don’t conceded that, but let’s strike it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.747" offset="5240650">There is still plenty in this indictment and the evidence of the trial may show nothing relating to a vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.347" offset="5275027">There is no charge with respect to his speech which is the only thing to which the Johnson case applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.718" offset="5300523">And unless the Court is prepared to hold that nothing that a senator does as a senator can be questioned in any other place under the speech and debate clause, a result prior beyond anything that has ever yet been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.112" offset="5370113">It seems to me that there is no basis for holding that this indictment of itself without any evidence is in violation of the Speech and Debate clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1366.576" offset="5540013">He doesn’t have to receive it with the requisite intent and that it is not necessary to prove that there was in fact any legislative act of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.909" offset="5589332">And, I think that becomes quite clear when you consider the solicitation language in the statute ask, demands, seeks, solicits any bribe it would not be possible to prosecute the solicitation of a bribe if the other construction of the statute is taken until you waited to see whether he did something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.917" offset="5713362">And as I have tried to develop in the supplemental brief which we have filed, I think that a prosecution under this statute can be maintained and that the indictment is sufficient without the showing of any speech or debate of any kind, without the showing of any action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.942" offset="5793401">If there is evidence which can show that at the time he solicited or received the bribe, he intended to take legislative action in accordance with the bribes request.</text>

            <text syncTime="1455.188" offset="5894443">I should like to address myself first to the suggestion made by the Solicitor General in his closing comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.730" offset="5928611">First, I would request to the Court that attention be given to the five particular subject matter which is now asserted by the Solicitor General was never argued below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.432" offset="5971452">It was not the textural aspect of the case when it was before the District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.148" offset="5994230">What was before the District Judge was perfectly clearly set forth in connection with the debate in colloquy and in connection with the record of the case as it there existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.453" offset="6035504">Government counsel there said that under this indictment and I am quoting from page 28 of the record extract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.536" offset="6063821">We are not contending that what is being charged here, that is the activity by Brewster was anything other than a legislative act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.878" offset="6101228">We are not ducking the question, it is squarely presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.066" offset="6117946">They are legislative acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.634" offset="6124216">We are not going to quibble over that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.405" offset="6135292">Now, the important point to this case as we see it is this, this case does not test the outer limits of speech or debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.765" offset="6172699">This case falls squarely within the hard core of speech or debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.678" offset="6192343">In the earlier arguments and in the brief that the Government which is earlier submitted in this case, the Government conceded that while the precise limits of Johnson may be a little vague, “we do not contend that the clause for text only speech.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.077" offset="6253992">And then they went back to two formal holdings of this Court in the Powell case and in the Kilbourn case, committee reports, resolutions, any act of voting are equally covered as are “things generally done in a session of the House by one of its members in relation to the business before it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.389" offset="6327239">That has never been a doubted proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.667" offset="6340301">It was against the text of that and this Court’s clause as it’s imposed it on the Speech or Debate Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.264" offset="6366736">The District Judge Hart made his decision against the background of that he plays an indictment which followed as the Solicitor General has candidly conceded to the Court and into question, official conduct in the nature of action, vote and decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.894" offset="6445208">Now this illusive memorandum of conferences was known to trial counsel below and certainly appellate counsel are charged with knowledge of what trial counsel did know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.710" offset="6488572">All we put that before the Court before in the first instance was to make the Court aware that this case was not decided in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.398" offset="6519292">That there was justification for the comment by Judge Hart “based on the facts of this case” that this was not decided in the abstract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1637.287" offset="6622841">And it did sir, but that was simply clarified and in that regard, our position in that matter is this, basically when a Congressman using, of course that is general phraseology, when a Congressman is accused of improper conduct, improper motivation, then there must come at some point in the preceding when either before the Grand Jury action is brought to stop improper intrusion into areas covered by speech or debate or if after indictment when a Trial Court has occasion to have access to the precise facts upon which the application of speech or debate is made apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.671" offset="6780412">We say that that is what happened in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.842" offset="6793055">It was not challenged at the Grand Jury level as this true in another case currently pending and as to which I will make no detailed comment, but it was challenged by a 12 (b) (1) motion as soon as it could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.230" offset="6842583">That is to say, we put before the Court and the Government cooperated in putting before the Court that what was being questioned in this case was legislative conduct, not the postulated absence of legislative conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2140.123" offset="8634165">The Government had not postured either its indictment or it is a presentation on the hypothetical ability to reach outside and find some circumstance which we permit the drawing of a claim that it was outside speech or debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.221" offset="8690590">It had challenged the lower court by bringing in any indictment squarely designed to fall within speech or debate as Johnson defined it and put the issue to the District Judge to say that this was a narrowly drawn statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2176.790" offset="8780869">Now under those circumstances, it was clean and clear that they post the issue to the Trial Court, are you now willing to say that if we take a statute which we deemed to be a precise narrowly drawn statute that you will say that speech or debate must surrender to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.565" offset="8871984">And that was the way it was before the Court and the facts were before the Court at what was being challenged with legislative conduct of the senator.</text>

            <text syncTime="2256.365" offset="9099145">But coming pass that point, I would say sir that, in for example, the bribed Congressman’s immunity from prosecution which is common in all private law review fights extensively and is one the leading works dealing with the subject matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2636.555" offset="10619889">Now, I am not suggesting that the way that is foreclosed by speech or debate is the conversation having to do with whether or not a bribe would or would not be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.155" offset="10658341">I am saying that government said, in this case, we intend to show the receipt of campaign contributions because the first in count, which the Solicitor General selected as typical, and which I will use as typical if the Court will keep in mind that count nine has a slight variant and it refers backward to the receipt of moneys there for as distinct or action taken there for to as distinct from anticipated action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.935" offset="10753427">It is alleged in this indictment that the defendant sought, accepted, received and agreed to received the sum of $5,000.00 for himself and for an entity the DC Committee for Maryland Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.017" offset="10801701">A political fund in other words, it is what is alleged to be involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2711.942" offset="10921447">And that being the case, it is perfectly clear that this was an attempt to precisely stage this case for that decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2751.821" offset="11081003">And that against the background of a fully known revelation to the trial judge of precisely what factual data that government intended to prove which they supplied as they say is pre-handed fashion to the defendant but did not put into the record because of the very good chance of pretrial, prejudicial publicity in a case for trial then pending shortly after the hearing date of the motions which were then before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.018" offset="11189776">And it was, as I suggest to the Court, a perfectly useful, desirable, and necessary proposition that courts proceed on this particularly areas whereas the Court said in Powell.</text>

            <text syncTime="2839.757" offset="11432715">In order to put our position in this case in proper context, I think I return to the basic principle from which we rely may be help.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.045" offset="11473884">First of all, we premise our argument on the announced concept as laid down by this Court, that one of the functions of Speech and Debate Clause is to relieve the senator of a duty of expanding itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.345" offset="11523099">That is announced in several of the recent expositions as respect to meaning of speech or debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.591" offset="11548072">We further would state to the Court that this imposes a duty on a trial of such cases or one before in such case comes to inquire into the case which is intended to be made by the prosecutor against the defendant on the particular facts of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.581" offset="11619961">Now keep in mind, if you will please that our opposition is that if there is an interrogation which is violative of speech or debate, and an indictment has already been returned or has been at least one violation of speech or debate in the very inquiry which was the underlying, critical for the indictment which is returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.131" offset="11706165">Therefore, the rules of the District Judge before such a case comes, to look to the facts of the case, to look to the indictment, and to see whether what has been done, is a set of circumstances which leads to application of speech or debate and which are properly to cause him to enter into the case for the purpose of dismissing it because he has an obligation to honor the senator’s right, not to be called upon to defend, if the case is violative of speech or debate.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norman P. Ramsey</label>
            <text syncTime="2950.249" offset="11874707">As a practical matter, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the way we see it and what we premise our argument on is a direct quote out of the Johnson case and in that case this Court said, "Speaking thereof conspiring to give a speech in return for a compensation from private sources."</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.477" offset="11939595">However reprehensible, we believe that the Speech or Debate Clause extends at least so far as to prevent it from being made the basis of a criminal charge. Speaking backward through the quality of that as it sufficiently indictable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.178" offset="12002394">And I think the policy considerations sir, which is behind that is simply this, the clause is designed to prevent harassment of the legislator by either an unfriendly executive or by an unfriendly judiciary if that be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.032" offset="12057773">But in the first instance, the Grand Jury investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.847" offset="12069058">It is to shield him from being hailed in before the Grand Jury, queried as respects to his motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.124" offset="12094136">Now, if I may postulate a case which is illustrative, I think it would run this way, if the court does not vindicate speech or debate as stopping Grand Jury inquiry, is it not perfectly possible for an unfriendly prosecutor to hail in any member of the Congress, put before that Grand Jury a list of the contributors who contributed to his last campaign and within the frame or reference to the bribery statute, then put against that testimony that a given Senator and/or Congressman voted, in a particular way, favorable to the very interest who had contributed so heavily to his campaign funding at the time when he ran?</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.631" offset="12252229">Now, from that, it would be postulated that you may draw the inference that the vote favorable to whatever interest it may be, could be said to be or an inference could be drawn that it was predicated upon the earlier contribution of money to his campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.691" offset="12316490">It is this peculiar aspect of the elective process the need of the representative to get himself elected which sets apart the legislative from all the balance of government with the exception of, of course the president and vice president who are in a position where they necessarily are participants in political campaigns in order to become elected representatives of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.753" offset="12404679">But basically, we think the policy is cleanly stated and we think the policy a wise one in that, the essence of the charge again is this Court said in Johnson, and speaking there to the Johnson charge, in this context, is that the congressman’s conduct was improperly motivated and as well appear that is precisely what the Speech or Debate Clause generally forecloses from executive and judicial inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.529" offset="12523798">Now, coming back to my original view of the matter, I would say, sir, that we approached it this way, the Court owes an obligation because of the prayer, the Court I am talking now the Court hearing such a case, owes was an obligation to examine the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.130" offset="12586178">In this case, it was conceded by the government and found by the court that a necessary root of the case was inquiry into legislative conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.171" offset="12634348">And it was at that stage that Judge Hart granted the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.348" offset="12651066">Now, the price of the prosecution to this sort is, that it would seek to have a finder of fact, usually a jury but not necessary so, to draw inferences between the campaign funds on the one hand and positions taken politically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.971" offset="12709581">Judgment calls by a man who makes policy, by a man who does indeed address himself to consideration which are based upon the well being of those whom he represents.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="3291.965" offset="13241538">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.856" offset="13257107">It seems to me that Mr. Ramsey unduly treats legislative act as synonymous with and absolutely the equivalent of speech or debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.678" offset="13320428">There is nothing in the constitution which relates and which refers in anyway to legislative acts and we submit that there are many acts which a legislator may do and may properly do as a legislator which are appropriate for a congressman or senator to do which are customarily done by congressman or senators which are not speech or debate and which are not within the protection of the Speech or Debate Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.157" offset="13438292">If the Court should reach the conclusion that the Speech or Debate Clause protects a congressman or senator with respect to anything that he does after he takes the oath of office, our case would be difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.694" offset="13500464">Although, as Mr. Justice Marshall has suggested, it is very hard to accept the conclusion that taking a bribe is a legislative act even within a very broad definition of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.769" offset="13568800">As we see in this case, the case can be proved without bringing in to question any legislative act, any speech or debate, the only word in the indictment which gives me any pause at all is the word “vote.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.199" offset="13646436">If the word vote were not there, if we now excise it, we make no use of it, I can find that nothing in the indictment which is in anyway in conflict with the Speech or Debate Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.955" offset="13697532">It is suggested, turning to another matter, that the matter of punishing a Senator who takes the bribe is by the constitution committed solely to that House of Congress and that Congress has a legislative body, has no power to deal with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.514" offset="13771719">I should think that that was adequately disposed off by this Court’s decision in the Burton Case, some 60 years ago, where a congressman was convicted under a statute for taking fees in connection with appearances before the Executive Branch of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.570" offset="13851967">And more recently in Powell against McCormick where a similar argument has made, that the power of Congress of the House or the Senate to exclude was exclusive and that prevented the Court from giving a declaratory judgment on the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.157" offset="13938276">Both of those cases seem to me to dispose of that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.779" offset="13956771">And then finally, as has been suggested in the argument, it seems to me that the -- or our position is here, that the offense was committed when the bribe was solicited or taken with the requisite intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.067" offset="14025943">It is immaterial thereafter, whether any action including even any legislative action that short of speech or debate was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.750" offset="14068679">The argument is that rather similar to that which was rejected in the case in the Second Circuit involving Judge Matten, or a part of the defense was--it's a different statute, the case is not controlling but the analogy is close.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.755" offset="14144748">Part of the defense was that though we took the bribe, it didn’t influences decisions that all of the cases were decided right and a part of the charge which was sought to be submitted to the jury there was, that if the case where decided right, and then he could not be convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.605" offset="14228131">That was--the argument that was rejected by Court of Appeals which Mr. Justice Sutherland sat and that the decision was that the taking in the bribe completed the offense and it was not necessary to show that the promised action was carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.127" offset="14314230">Similarly here, the taking of the bribe, at least for the record was an intent, is the essence and the substance of the offense and as we see it, it is not necessary to prove certainly any speech or debate in order to maintain the prosecution accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.847" offset="14385074">We think the judgment below should be reversed.</text>
