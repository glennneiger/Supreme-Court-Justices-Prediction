            <text syncTime="219.160" offset="876565">Now in this effort to find a publisher, Dr. Rodberg consulted with the witness Webber, it was mentioned in the record and also upon -- on behalf of Senator Gravel an agreement with the Beacon Press of Boston to publish the Pentagon Papers which had been inserted in the committee records, in a book.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.757" offset="999027">The government issued what I call a John Doe grand jury investigation in the district of Massachusetts.</text>

            <text syncTime="340.526" offset="1362024">Now, the controversies, three -- there is a controversy here between the government on the one hand and Senator Gravel on the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="720.978" offset="2883814">If those two things are concur, the immunity to the aide is exactly like the immunity of the legislature, and it is held by the court below, I think quite wiseman has held in other cases that that is so (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="742.642" offset="2970540">The government takes a very peculiar position in this case, it takes a position at the Speech and the Debate Clause, protects a legislator only in three respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.339" offset="3029264">First, it protects him against criminal prosecution for what transpires within the scope of his legislative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.727" offset="3062805">Second, that it exempts him from the civil liability and third that it exempts him from being the person to be dragged before a Grand Jury by subpoena and in the person interrogated by the Grand Jury, that's the position of the Solicitor General and he takes a very strict construction of -- he should place that on the fact that the clause says for any speech or debate in either House, they, that is legislators shall not be questioned in any other place.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.462" offset="3209822">He says that, the only people mentioned as the legislators. Now that reminds me the argument that was made in the Court in Venice when Shylock demanded his pound of flesh.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.511" offset="3266038">He said that its nominated in the bond, I am to get my pound of flesh.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.292" offset="3289130">Well my reply to the argument of Solicitor General is that same as posture made.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.915" offset="3307624">It's also impliedly nominated in the bond that all you get as your pound of flesh, you don't get a drop of blood, and this -- this bond in this case could not possibly to be subjected to the interpretation that the government places upon it without taking the life of blood of the Constitution because this clause was imposed in -- it was placed in the Constitution for a two-fold purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.973" offset="3423817">The first purpose was wrath on that experience in the England and there in England, the Quito and the Stuart kings have the members of the parliament held in the court, prosecuted, convicted and sentenced to jail falsely, making speeches on the floor, making speeches in parliament which was displeasing to the crown and so in the Bill of Rights of 1688, the provision was incorporated that members of the parliament should not be called upon to answer in any court or in any other places except for parliament for their activities as members of the parliament.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.076" offset="3620258">And so that was brought in down prosecution for that reason and as so well stated by Justice Harlan in the Johnson case for an additional reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.154" offset="3668532">He quotes in his very fine opinion in that case, a statement of Madison and Federalist Papers on the separation of the powers of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.892" offset="3715553">And after pointing out how the powers of the government are separated by a written Constitution in this country, Madison says that the next important thing is to have some practical methods by which to enforce the doctrine of the separation of the powers and prevent one branch of the government from trespassing upon the domain of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.435" offset="3805727">And in the Johnson case, it is said that the Speech and Debate Clause was one of the practical obstacles created by the Constitution to forbid the trespass by the other branches of the government upon the domain reserved by the Constitution to the legislative branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.344" offset="3893290">Now manifestly, if you take the interpretation this Court would place upon this false of the Constitution, the interpretation for which the government contends, it would make the clause virtually worthless because it would allow even aides of these Senator, or third parties to testify the Senator's conduct within the scope of his legislative activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.186" offset="4016692">Now the purpose of this clause as the Court held in the Johnson case is to keep legislators from being a accountable to the other two branches of the government and to keep them from being intimated by the other two branches of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.354" offset="4093388">The Solicitor General suggests that or having the -- the Senators conduct testified to by his aides or by third persons has no more deterrent effect on his legislative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.996" offset="4167889">Then having him the subject to the criticism of his constituents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.038" offset="4188056">Well I submit that that it's not a valid, that shows it's not in accord with the facts of legislative life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.526" offset="4218044">I have spent about six years serving in the legislature of North Carolina and altogether I have served almost 19 years in the Congress in one House or the other and I have to testify this Court that among the most timid creatures I have ever met are legislators and they can cope with an isolated criticism of their constituents who have right under the Constitution incidentally to criticize them and they can cope with the criticism of the press which has right criticize their conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.674" offset="4362658">But I don't know anything that would come nearer scare the poor Senator or poor Representative to the death than to have either the executive branch of the government with all the might, governmental might which the executive branch possesses, or the judicial branch of the government with all of the respect which the judicial branch enjoys as an impartial body, of holding a Senator or a Congressmen accountable not for the legislative acts that they have right to review and exercise a judicial power to measure their constitutionality but to have the power to pass officially in any way, all of their conduct as a legislator, that would absolutely destroy the independence of the legislative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.621" offset="4574459">And that was precisely the reason I think the Court said in the Johnson case, that this was intended to keep legislators from being held accountable to the other branches of the government or intimidated by the other branches government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.690" offset="4634749">I respect to submit that the question is whether the Dr. Rodberg is exempt, is the answer to the decision of this Court in the Johnson case where a Representative was prosecuted for conflict of interest, the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.094" offset="4728372">And this Court said the language of the speech or debate clause clearly proscribes at least some of the evidence taken during the trial exclude extensive questioning without concerning how much of the speech was written by Johnson himself, how much by his administrative system and how much by outsiders representing the loan company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.986" offset="4815935">The government will try to ask specifically about certain sentences in the speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.286" offset="4833071">He has taken the stand there in his own behalf that the reasons for that inclusion and his personal knowledge of the facts and materials supporting those statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.360" offset="4873404">In closing our argument the theory of the prosecution was very clearly depended upon the wording of the speech in addition to questioning the mammoth preparation and the precise ingredients of the speech, the government inquired into the motives for giving it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.222" offset="4940800">The constitutional infirmity, in fact, this prosecution is not merely a matter of introduction of inadmissible evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.012" offset="4972042">The attention given to the speech of substance and the motivation was not an incidental part of the government's case which might have then aborted by omitting certain lines of questioning or excluding certain evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1536.574" offset="6146194">I think that some that – that Woodrow Wilson said one of the most important functions of Congressman, his important function he has a duty to inform his colleagues, the duty to inform his constituents, the duty to inform the general public about he thinks the government is being run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.118" offset="6228428">They now use not only the with congressional record and the committee reports, but in many instances Congressmen use a radio and a television, they are right books on the subject and I think that this Speech and Debate Clause is broad enough to cover any activity where a Senator or Congressmen attempts to inform either his colleagues or his constituents or the general public and I think it's protected by the Speech and Debate Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.133" offset="6336470">But, I think if he is not protected by the Speech and Debate Clause, then he is protected by the First Amendment because everybody gets a right to comment on the government under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.804" offset="6379207">And I think that if you could summon even third parties and the Court held in this case you couldn't summon third parties to testify to the meeting of the committee, but I think if you summon third parties that if you do not transgress, regardless the third party should testify that action of a Senator or Congressman and inform his constituents, that is covered by the Speech and Debate Clause, but it is not covered in that by is right as a citizen under First Amendment because if you intimidate a publisher or a publisher acting for Senator, by asking him to the divulge names of the purchasers of this book just equals as intimidating having official inquiry made by the government as to the circumstances under which they agreed to publish the book.</text>

            <text syncTime="1665.525" offset="6662060">I want to join with Senator Ervin in thanking this Court for allowing us to orally argue this case, representing the Senate as amicus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.839" offset="6703334">I think it is particularly important to note that this is the first time the Senate has, as a body appeared before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1737.480" offset="6949825">Many Senators, including myself, feel that the junior Senator from Alaska deeply abused the rules of the Senate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2471.251" offset="9884944">Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.143" offset="9896542">As Senators Ervin and Saxbe have indicated, there are really two basic issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.290" offset="9921097">One issue is that scope of the Speech and Debate Clause, that is the kinds of activities for the member of Congress which are privileged under the Clause and the second issue was whether the grand jury can conduct an inquiry into these activities if they are privileged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.191" offset="9980761">I would like to spend the time remaining today, to talk about the first issue and in particular on the question of publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.353" offset="10013362">First of all it is far too late today and indeed by about 300 years to argue that the free speech privilege of legislators encompasses only speech and debate in the literal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.432" offset="10057665">The privilege has never been construed that way in America or in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.425" offset="10073652">On the contrary it is always been construed broadly, to cover all functions of legislators, which are necessary to fulfill goals of representative government and according to Kilbourn case codified that by saying, those customary actions of members of Congress which are relative to the legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.429" offset="10149616">Obviously house breaking for example, isn't related to legislative process, it would not fulfill any goal of representative government, even under some kind of claim that the Senator needed the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.319" offset="10189218">But, the standard that we were suggesting is the broad standard of the Clause, those activities necessary to fulfill goals of representative government, is we think the only kind of standard which meets the purposes of the Clause and the Senator Ervin said, so well, those purposes are enforced to preserve separation of powers and to enable a representative to discharge its obligations to the electorate without fear of either Executive or Judicial intrusions.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="2601.522" offset="10406034">Another way to say that I suppose is that it's to preserve the integrity of an independent legislative body, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2608.738" offset="10434873">Yes Your Honor, both the independence and the integrity of an independent legislative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.735" offset="10454936">Therefore, the Clause does cover broadly all of those necessary functions and we think it is also a little too late in the day to argue that the informing function of Congress does not fall within that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.746" offset="10498926">In our system of government the because of the sovereignty of the people, because of the necessity of securing the rights of the people, Representatives have a duty, they have an obligation to inform their colleagues and their constituents and the public at large, about matters of public importance and specifically as Woodrow Wilson said in his classic study on Congress, specifically about executive conduct in both domestic and foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.472" offset="10593802">This obligation does not only derive from the fact that the people must be able to have this information in order to govern themselves intelligently, but it is also from a perception about the very operation of the Legislative process and that is the people must have this information in order to inform -- in turn inform their representatives of their well considered views on pending and potential legislations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.237" offset="10684918">What this is an interplay and I think Your Honors that practically every Congressman from the birth of the Republic has recognized this that there must be an interplay between a representative and the people and that this interplay is the bed rock, the heart of our system of a representative government.</text>

            <text syncTime="2704.187" offset="10816679">The question there Your Honor in the securing information for the subpoena power of Congress, is whether or not there is an executive privilege implied in Article 1, to prohibit this power, to prohibit the scope of the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.292" offset="10865162">This is never really been decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.128" offset="10876447">There is of course an article 1 enumerated executive privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.645" offset="10890553">It has been implied in the constitution by – at least as has been arguably implied because many Presidents have asserted the privilege and one would get into a conflict there between two constitutional privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.955" offset="10947814">One the privilege of Congress to obtain information and the second the privilege of the executive branch so withhold information from Congress, it's a difficult problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.562" offset="10982191">We don't have any kind of conflict of that sort here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.812" offset="10991177">What we have here is a member of Congress, who has information critical of executive conduct in foreign policy making not available to the people of United States through the holding of the subcommittee and through the publication material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.796" offset="11043109">And this is exactly the kind of conduct that is fallen within the mainstream of the hardcore purpose of the Speech and Debate Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.435" offset="11069649">The privilege both in England and America arose in order to allow unrestrained criticism by members of Congress of the administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.437" offset="11101727">We don't have here a civil case, where an individual claims that his constitutional rights are being violated, willfully by a member of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.396" offset="11133492">Those cases have been before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.440" offset="11141747">Normally you have a case here of bribed Congressmen, who argues a separation of power theory in some attenuated fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.992" offset="11163899">What we have here is a situation of United States Senator who is criticizing the executive about matters of overwhelming public importance, and if this kind of conduct is not protected by the Constitution then the promise of the Speech or Debate Clause which is as Mr. Justice Brennan and the Chief Justice have said, to preserve the independence and the integrity of the legislature, than that promise is illusionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.291" offset="11257104">Now I don't want the Court to think that we are making a novel argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.808" offset="11271210">In fact the free speech privilege of both England and America we think that there is overwhelming evidence to support the proposition that these privileges were designed specifically to enable members of Congress to inform the electorate about executive behavior, and specifically through the publication of committee records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.418" offset="11345607">The English Bill of Rights resulted from a notorious prosecution of the Speaker of the House of Commons, who assert -- who had privately printed and distributed a committee record, accusing the King of malfeasance in office and that led to the exile of James II and the enactment of first free speech privilege and historians are unanimous and concluding that the very purpose of the codification was to bring publication within it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2866.861" offset="11467442">The Court of Appeals felt that there might be a common law privilege akin to the executive privilege, but we think that the Speech or Debate Clause itself is adequate and that no additional privilege need to be implied or created out the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.886" offset="11519478">In our own country Thomas Jefferson and James Madison both articulated the view very eloquently that the free speech privilege covered communications from a member of Congress to its constituents in the form of newsletters or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.635" offset="11570469">There was a Grand Jury investigation during a reign of the (Inaudible) laws fairly similar to this one, the claim of the executive laws that members of Congress were giving aid and comfort to enemies of the United States and Jefferson condemned that investigation as a blatant violation of privilege.</text>
