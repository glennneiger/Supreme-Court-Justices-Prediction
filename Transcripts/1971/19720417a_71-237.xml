            <label>Ms. Maria L. Marcus</label>
            <text syncTime="21.765" offset="160763">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.943" offset="173406">This habeas corpus proceeding presents the question of whether New York is prohibited from using a 1964 Tennessee murder conviction as a predicate for increased punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.052" offset="221890">This Tennessee conviction resulted from a retrial where the prior recorded testimony of a witness was read into the record because the witness had since moved to Sweden.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.115" offset="266089">To state briefly the history of the Tennessee and New York proceedings, the crime of which respondent Stubbs was convicted was a 1954 murder of Mrs. Alex Holm.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.365" offset="315094">Stubbs met Mr. and Mrs. Holm, an elderly Swedish couple who were strangers to him at a road side picnic table.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.117" offset="346128">He kidnapped them at gunpoint and ultimately murdered Mrs. Holm and seriously wounded her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.655" offset="376325">At Stubbs' 1954 trial, defendant was represented by three appointed counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.402" offset="403284">Alex Holm testified as did Stubbs himself and Stubbs was convicted of first degree murder, kidnapping and assault with intent to murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.981" offset="437556">Nine years later, Stubbs moved for a writ of habeas corpus in the District Court in Tennessee asking that his conviction be vacated on the grounds that his attorneys were appointed three days before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.982" offset="489592">The District Court under a former Circuit Court rule, which required automatic reversal in cases of tardy appointment of counsel, vacated Stubbs' first trial and remanded him for possible retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.106" offset="546121">At the second trial in 1964, the prosecutor sent a subpoena to Alex Holm's former address, a farm in in Texas, which was returned unsigned and he also contacted Holm's son, who advised the court that his father was now a permanent resident of Sweden.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.177" offset="626370">His son took the stand and so testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.867" offset="641103">The prior testimony of Holm was then read into the record over objections by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.148" offset="662314">Stubbs was among the witnesses who testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.353" offset="675062">He was convicted of first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.724" offset="684570">The conviction was appealed to the Supreme Court of Tennessee and affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.443" offset="703483">After his release from the Tennessee prison, he went to Monroe County, New York, where he was arrested and convicted for first degree assault and possession of a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.275" offset="750817">Based upon the predicate of the Tennessee conviction, his sentence as second felony offender was 32-34 years.</text>

            <label>Ms. Maria L. Marcus</label>
            <text syncTime="180.438" offset="795434">Well, when he appealed his conviction to the Tennessee Supreme Court, they gave him credit for the 10-year period between trials and apparently he served only about two more years and it's not explained exactly why he was paroled at that point but that's apparently what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.169" offset="862307">A petition for writ of habeas corpus challenging both convictions was filed in United States District Court for the western district of New York, which denied the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.399" offset="907238">The Second Circuit, which had granted a certificate of probable cause solely on the grounds of the validity of the Tennessee conviction reverse the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.757" offset="948721">The Court below held that respondent had been deprived of his right of confrontation at the Tennessee retrial because due diligence had not been exercised to obtain the presence of the absent witness before the testimony of Alex Holm was read into the record and because counsel of the first trial had been tardily appointed and had not questioned Holm about whether after Stubbs had kidnapped the Holms at gunpoint, they had made him welcome as their Guest.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.580" offset="1079960">This absence of questioning on the Guest theory; the majority held it could not be harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.406" offset="1107336">The dissenting judge Leonard P. Moore called the majority decision an extraordinary example of justice dispensed by the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.999" offset="1145684">We urge reversal of the decision below on three grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.932" offset="1161357">First, that there was no lack of due diligence in obtaining presence of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.336" offset="1182987">Second, that even assuming that due diligence was not exercised, the error in this case would have been harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.538" offset="1215796">And third, the tardy appointment of counsel at the first trial did not in fact, deprive respondent Stubbs of effective legal assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.752" offset="1260727">Barber versus Page was not violated by the use of testimony of the witness permanently domiciled in a foreign continent.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.866" offset="1289148">This Court in Barber versus Page, ruled that a good faith effort must be made to have a witness present, prior to reading his testimony into the record at another trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="324.178" offset="1370337">Of course, this was not only before this Court decided Barber, but even before this Court decided Pointer.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.736" offset="1400639">However, it should be pointed out that it would have been greatly to the prosecutor's advantage to have this witness at the trial, simply because he was a victim to a very, very tragic circumstance; his wife had been murdered, he himself, was shot twice in the face, and of course the sympathetic effect of such testimony in the jury, would have been much greater than simply --</text>

            <text syncTime="1611.548" offset="6519907">Perhaps in order to clarify the questions that are raised, I should address myself first to what happened, the facts of the case at the Tennessee trial a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.236" offset="6574660">The un-controverted testimony was that some 55 miles away from the homicide, the place where the homicide took place, in another part of Tennessee, Stubbs approached Mr. and Mrs. Holm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.348" offset="6643101">Now Stubbs was hungry, he had been without food.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.822" offset="6652923">His, this is Stubbs' testimony, for some time he was desperate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.326" offset="6674970">He wanted a ride to get up to New York where he had relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.145" offset="6702242">As he approached the Holms, asked them for a ride, was refused, went away and then he said, he remembered he had the gun, he came back, forced his way in their car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.645" offset="6748218">He drove, they were in the back seat and away they went.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.628" offset="6764205">Now, at this point, of course, we have a serious misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.970" offset="6789596">Now the testimony of Stubbs was that very shortly, after this trip began friendly relations began to exist between him and the Holms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.937" offset="6841423">They began to express sympathy for his condition and said, if you had only asked us properly for a ride, we would have given you one, or food.</text>

            <text syncTime="3345.931" offset="13457403">The sentence here is not different, but as this Court pointed out in both Sibron and Morgan, it must be considered what would happen on a subsequent conviction and what would happen is that the sentencing Court would undoubtedly regard as crucial in determining what kind of person this is, what sort of chances for rehabilitation and what sort of danger he poses to the public in being released.</text>
