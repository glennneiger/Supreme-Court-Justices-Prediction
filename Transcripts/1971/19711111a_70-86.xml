            <label>Mr. Allan A. Tuttle</label>
            <text syncTime="28.550" offset="187827">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.206" offset="198485">This case involves the question of the propriety of the use in a 1953 sentencing hearing and sentencing proceeding of records of prior convictions, in 1938, 1946, and possibly 1950, which were obtained in the absence of counsel or alleged to have been obtained in the absence of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.702" offset="292526">Tucker was convicted in 1953 of the robbery of the Federally Insured Savings and Loan Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.904" offset="321260">He was convicted in the United State’s District Court for the Northern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.811" offset="340904">Now, the evidence in the case which consisted of four eye witnesses and fingerprint evidence and testimony is concededly overwhelming and the validity of his conviction and the strength of the evidence against him is not challenged in this proceeding or before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.868" offset="409136">Tucker took the stand in his own defense in these proceedings, in that trial and he was cross examined with respect to certain prior state felony convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.454" offset="451455">He was cross examined with respect to and admitted a 1938 conviction for theft of an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.994" offset="477682">He was cross examined and admitted a 1946 jewelry store robbery in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.007" offset="505685">He was cross examined with respect to and admitted a conviction for armed robbery in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.930" offset="529404">He was shortly thereafter convicted of the crime of robbery of a Federally Insured Savings and Loan Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.727" offset="556571">Thereafter, the judge, the trial court conducted a sentencing hearing at which it took evidence with respect to the defendant Tucker.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.025" offset="589799">With respect to these convictions which I have mentioned, certain further evidence was brought out.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.136" offset="610175">It was brought out with respect to the 1938 automobile theft conviction that he had served seven of the 10 years which had been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.990" offset="645597">With respect to the 1946 jewelry store burglary that he had served 45 months out of a four-year sentence, and with respect to the 1950 armed robbery conviction, that he had served no time because he escaped after a sentence of five years was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.517" offset="711739">Other information with respect to the defendant was also brought out.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.099" offset="726054">It was brought out for instance that he was under indictment in the Los Angeles for another federal armed bank robbery, which was to precede the trial immediately after the sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.791" offset="764820">It was brought out that he was a suspect in four other federal bank robberies and seven or eight armed robberies of local savings and loan associations in the San Francisco area and the evidence with respect tot those robberies was elicited, that is to say that there was evidence, eye witness testimony and fingerprint testimonies with respect to those other charges and investigations against the defendant Tucker.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.886" offset="853218">Tucker was sentenced to the maximum permissible term under the statute providing for armed bank robbery of the Federally Insured Bank, which is 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.442" offset="899402">Now, later on in the same year, the State of California brought proceedings against Tucker for armed robbery and he was convicted of four arm robberies under California Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.984" offset="941616">This proceeding occurred under the California recidivist statute, so that the indictment on that case charged to four arm robberies and in addition charged two of the three prior felony convictions I have mentioned, the 1938 auto theft and a 1946 jewelry store burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.050" offset="1017894">Following this Court’s decision in Gideon versus Wainwright, Tucker successfully attacked, first his habitual offender status in California and later on the underlying California convictions for armed robbery on the ground that the use of those two priors had been prejudicial in as much as he had not had counsel in 1938, and he had not counsel in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.923" offset="1125414">Now, following the state court’s vacation of those two prior; 1938 and 1946 convictions, that is to say its finding that there had been no counsel, Tucker brought a motion under 2255, attacking the conviction which is the subject of this case, the bank robbery conviction, alleging that the use in cross examination of those two priors which were concededly on counsel and also alleging that the use of the 1950 conviction which had theretofore not been challenged as counseled or un-counseled, had prejudiced him when it was used for cross examination and impeachment purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.884" offset="1285179">Now, the District Court and the Court of Appeals, both found that the use of un-counseled priors was improper, but they found that the error was harmless because of the overwhelming evidence against the defendant in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.778" offset="1352784">The Court of Appeals, however, found further that those priors had been used at the sentencing hearing and at the sentencing hearing, the judge might possibly have relied upon and the Court of Appeals said that the reliance could not be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under Chapman and remanded the case for re-sentencing without the use or reliance upon the un-counseled prior convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.147" offset="1458214">Therefore, the case is before this Court now, at the request of the United States to determine whether the Court of Appeals was correct in remanding that case for re-consideration of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.483" offset="1503562">The question which this Court, this case presents in this Court is whether a particular rule of evidence, specifically an exclusionary rule of evidence, should be applied to sentencing proceedings, so as to deprive the sentencing judge of knowledge or reliance upon prior convictions which were obtained without the assistance of counsel prior to Gideon.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.106" offset="1598126">Now, it seems to be common ground among all the parties in this case, that a judge should have access to and should be entitled to rely upon all reliable, relevant information concerning a defendant’s character, background, habits or dispositions which can be brought before the sentencing judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.001" offset="1745665">Before this morning, I have been of the impression that the 1950 sentence -- the 1950 conviction had not been challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.914" offset="1781296">Within the hour, Mr. Reppy showed me a copy of the 2255 motion in District Court, which was not made part of the record certified to this Court which indicates they also challenged the 1950 conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.736" offset="1848588">I believe it was, but I simply do not know because I had thought that that conviction was not being challenged before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.939" offset="1881397">We are informed by the clerk of the Dade County Court because we inquired with respect to this, that petitioner did have counsel during the 1950 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.921" offset="1929358">I should say that the respondent Tucker alleges in his brief that he did not have counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.955" offset="1953495">That question was never decided Mr. Justice White because that 1950 conviction was not one of the two priors that was alleged in the California recidivist prosecution, and therefore, not one of the priors with respect to what you are hearing --</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan A. Tuttle</label>
            <text syncTime="490.009" offset="2033744">The court -- the District Court simply held that the use of priors, un-counseled priors without making specific findings, but acknowledging the United States' admission with respect to the 36, 38 and 46 priors that they were un-counseled, said that the use of un-counseled priors in cross examination would be bad.</text>

            <text syncTime="523.719" offset="2168535">I do not think that that is a dispositive consideration Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.473" offset="2187553">I know that the two, 38 and 46 were pleas of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.082" offset="2206047">As I said, I have believed until today that the 1950 conviction what not being challenged at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="546.720" offset="2260591">At the Trial, and I think this is quite significant, he neither denied the convictions nor as I want to say with respect to the 1938 and 1946 convictions, he not only did not deny those convictions, he admitted those convictions, but he want further, he admitted the underlying conduct.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="allan_a_tuttle" startTime="568.265" stopTime="743.181">
            <label>Mr. Allan A. Tuttle</label>
            <text syncTime="568.265" offset="2346691">He affirmatively admitted the underlying conduct and I think that insofar as there might be a question about the reliability of un-counseled convictions, this cannot be considered in this -- in the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.120" offset="2406145">I call the Court’s attention to page 24 of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.544" offset="2427879">With respect to the 1938 automobile theft, the question about that conviction, answer, “it boils down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.225" offset="2462570">I was 17 years old, broke into a man’s garage, took his automobile, went joyriding in it, and received a 10-year sentence for it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="606.437" offset="2499455">So, he admits the conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.638" offset="2508232">He says it was joyriding, but he admits he took the car and went from the man’s garage.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.590" offset="2532055">With respect to the 1946 jewelry store burglary, again on page 24, “I broke into a jewelry store” and on page 24 where New Orleans, question; day or night; answer “at night.”</text>
            <text syncTime="630.714" offset="2596526">So, that with respect to those two convictions, the question of whether counsel -- whether the absence of counsel makes the conviction unreliable does not appear before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.959" offset="2641456">With respect to the 1950 conviction, the record as at now stands indicates that there has been no determination; first of all, whether was counsel or not, no judicial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.604" offset="2704046">We have made inquiries and we have been told and we recite in our brief that the Dade County Clerk indicates to us that counsel was supplied.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.004" offset="2741662">The respondent Tucker in his brief says that he did not have counsel and there has been no determination of that fact, but we submit that it seems to us that all of the considerations of modern criminology, calling for the individuation of punishment require that a sentencing judge have all relevant information before him, which will help him in determining that punishment, and that what include evidence of un-counseled convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.628" offset="2872170">The application of ordinary rules of evidence or in particular an exclusionary rule of evidence to the sentencing proceedings, would it seems to us to deprive the judge a valuable information concerning a defendant’s background, a defendant’s character and dispositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.527" offset="2935804">Now, in Williams versus New York, this Court specifically refused to apply ordinary rules of evidence, the sentencing proceedings and specifically recognized that the application of ordinary rules of evidence would frustrate the purpose of individuation of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.502" offset="3003722">You will recall that in Williams, the judge had to report that the defendant was involved in some 30 other burglaries, in addition to the murder which was the charge in the indictment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan A. Tuttle</label>
            <text syncTime="744.716" offset="3052519">Just hearsay information, Your Honor and this Court and the judge relied upon it, said he relied upon it, acknowledged that there had been no convictions resulting from those report of the other burglaries and as you recall sentenced William to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.626" offset="3108212">Now, in this case also, the sentencing judge had before him substantial information concerning this defendant’s criminal activity which had not resulted in a conviction un-counseled or not or an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.283" offset="3162756">There was the allegation that this defendant had been involved in four federal bank robberies, the allegation that he had been involved in 7 or 8 armed robberies of Savings and Loan Institutions and the sentencing judge was told by the witness, he was examining out for this purpose that the evidence was substantial, that it was substantial and the same as it had been in this trial, that is eye witness testimony and fingerprint testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.699" offset="3260454">And the use of that information, which is allegation of criminal conduct, falling short of a conviction counseled or not, is not challenged in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.236" offset="3302668">It seems to us that it would be ironical, if it were proper for a Court to rely upon such hearsay information as Mr. Chief Justice describes it, rely upon that information in the assessment of sentence and yet would be deprived of reliance on the same information when it matured into a conviction, merely because the conviction was un-counseled.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.167" offset="3394305">Now, we know in this case that there is no doubt that Tucker committed the 1938 and the 1946 violations because he admitted that he did, but we submit that even un-counseled convictions where had been no such admissions are no more unreliable, then much of the evidence which is historically and traditionally been considered proper for a sentencing judge to rely upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.901" offset="3509244">We also would point out to this Court that the use of un-counseled convictions in this context has some evidence of criminality on the part of the defendant, is totally different from the use of such convictions under ordinary recidivist statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.868" offset="3573192">There, the prior convictions automatically increase the exposure or increase the mandatory minimum and it is the fact of conviction that creates automatically a harsher sentence and in that case we submit, the conviction operates to deprive the judge of discretion with a mandatory increase in sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.193" offset="3662426">Whereas the information here, the un-counseled conviction and the information suggests is merely being used to inform the discretion of the Court to give the most intelligent individual treatment to a particular offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.363" offset="3715089">For this reason, we think that this Court’s holding in Burgett versus Texas has no application to the facts at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.005" offset="3753646">Now, quite apart from the question of whether a sentencing judge should be permitted to rely upon un-counseled convictions, the law seems clear that a sentencing judge can rely upon the conduct, which underly conviction and any competent evidence of this criminal conduct, any reports of this conduct would be permissible information for the judge to use, even if he could not rely upon the fact that the conviction itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.112" offset="3866077">And we submit that any rule which would exclude the reliance upon such conduct, falling short of a conviction, would deprive the judge of much valuable information which Courts have traditionally, historically and properly relied upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.994" offset="3925636">A charge might be dropped because the prosecuting witness did not appear, or it might be dropped as an exercise of prosecutorial discretion --</text>

            <text syncTime="977.066" offset="3981956">That it -- I think that is an important distinction, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.350" offset="3999092">There are cases, even sentencing cases where suppressed evidence has not been used or permitted to be used as information before the sentencing judge and the rationale of those cases is part and parcel of the whole deterrent rationale of the perspective application of math.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.678" offset="4072340">The theory of the Courts that forbid the use of illegally seized evidence in a sentencing hearing suggests that if it were permitted, a prosecutor or the police could deprive an individual, would be encouraged, if they have enough evidence to seize a person for a narrowed crime, would be encouraged to engage in rampant searches thereafter, figuring that once they could convict him of the narrow crime, they could put in everything else on the sentencing hearing and obtain a maximum sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.920" offset="4253316">And, I -- I cannot tell you that the Circuit, but it is cited in the respondent’s brief, but it seems to me that the rationale, the deterrent rationale which would prohibit the use of that evidence all be in significant evidence is distinguishable from this case where we are only concerned about the issue of reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.558" offset="4339938">It is common place in pre-sentence reports, for instance, for a Probation Officer or the Prosecutor in talking to Probation Officer, to try and put the defendant in a context of criminality which may not be revealed by the indictment of the trial itself to give the sentencing judge some idea of this person’s place in an entire criminal scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.959" offset="4429486">That kind of information has always been included in pre-sentence reports, but it is information that may enhance punishment and it is not sworn, and it is not usually subject to cross examination, and yet it is information which we feel ought properly to be before the sentencing Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.955" offset="4505450">Further, even regardless of the reliability of the conviction, it seems to us that incarcerations that result as a basis of -- as a result of un-counseled convictions are information which a sentencing judge should have before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.791" offset="4568875">The Court will notice in this case, at the age of 17, Tucker is convicted of auto theft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.810" offset="4592908">He is sentenced to 10 years in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.778" offset="4600744">He stays in jail till mid 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.970" offset="4613597">Released in mid 1945, he is probably convicted again in 1946, stays in jail for mid 19 -- from 1946 until mid 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.034" offset="4653825">Released in the middle of 1949, he probably commits an armed robbery in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.032" offset="4673783">He is sentenced on that and he escapes, but less than a year later in 1951, he commits the crime which is subject of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.913" offset="4705339">Thus from the age of 17 and from 1938 to 1951, Tucker spent the entire intervening period with months exceptions in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.180" offset="4746403">Now, it seems to us the sentencing judge could not rationally individuate the punishment, or the treatment of Tucker, in ignorance of those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.334" offset="4782975">And, I think that respondent Tucker really admits that when he suggests that perhaps that information should be before the sentencing judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.753" offset="4828637">Now, I think finally, Your Honor, there is a -- there is no real evidence in this case that the sentencing judge relied upon these prior convictions in imposing the sentence which he did impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.227" offset="4894570">The judge was specifically told in this case that Tucker was a suspect in four other robberies, federal robberies, seven or eight other savings and loan robberies, and he was told on the strength of the evidence with respect to those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.083" offset="4957995">He was told about a pending indictment in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.490" offset="4971683">Now, the judge specifically said he would not consider the pending indictment in Los Angeles because in essence, that case would take care of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.505" offset="4999686">It would be a sentence appropriate to that offense, but his statements and these occur at the end of the sentencing hearing, indicate the matters which he truly relied upon and those are these pending investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.295" offset="5050886">This occurs on page 37 of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.434" offset="5063425">With the Court’s permission, I will read a few lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.058" offset="5077949">“I take it,” this is the Court asking the question, “You did not present these cases until you determined the fate of this particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1263.906" offset="5129254">”The witness, who is an FBI agent, “Well, these particular cases I am talking about are local.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.734" offset="5148584">They are under the jurisdiction of the local Police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.872" offset="5161123">There is no federal jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1281.332" offset="5198948">And then the Court, “I assume that whatever sentence is meted out to the defendant in this case at bar will be considered in connection with the Prosecution or absence of Prosecution in those cases.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1345.726" offset="5456620">Tucker then moved and this does not appear in the Appendix because it was not certified to this Court, Tucker then moved for a reconsideration of sentence on the ground of the sentencing judge, who incidentally was the same judge who in 1953 had heard the case, move for reconsideration of sentence on the grounds with the use of priors at sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.209" offset="5538540">And, the judge’s disposition of that was preemptory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.576" offset="5547944">He simply said this raises no new issues which would require consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.367" offset="5563095">Therefore, I think that it is clear that the sentencing judge in this case did not feel that those priors had influenced his sentencing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1948.497" offset="7867618">What the first one is that he realized or believed that the convictions then subject to collateral attack because Gideon had not been decided, were conclusive and as noted in respondent’s brief, there was considerable authority at that time that was so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.637" offset="7932193">Whether that be authority that commends itself to out logic, it seems to be irrelevant because defense counsel who was there at sentencing had told Mr. Tucker not to get into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.252" offset="7978691">The other possibility is that Mr. Tucker felt he would simply irk judge Harris by protesting innocence of matters by which he stood as the law then read validly convicted and judge Leventhal of the DC Circuit in his concurring opinion in the Scott Case which is cited in respondent’s briefs, states that the overwhelming majority of sentencing judges in his view do not like see a defendant before him protesting innocence after a lawful conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.986" offset="8113587">So, it is quite possible that had Mr. Tucker had the benefit of Gideon Mr. Tucker and his counsel at that point, he would not have stopped, and we would have had some explanation here of these incidents, the 1938 incident when he was 17 and the 1950 incident in Florida, and it is reasonably possible that he might have been convinced judge Harris.</text>

            <text syncTime="2395.957" offset="9657528">Well, I was not aware of that, but I think that the -- regardless of what procedure was originally used at sentencing, the procedure mentioned in the Fifth Circuit decision of Pat versus United States in 1966 is the desirable procedure to handle a collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.088" offset="9730044">Now, in the Pat case there was a federal prisoner, a direct prisoner is sentenced in a federal prison and he submitted a 2255 motion in which he alleged that the sentencing judge had before him on the pre-sentence report an entry that this man had been convicted of burglary and an entry that this man had raped someone, a girl and the judge took this, and I believe, although it is not clear, without holding an evidentiary hearing or without appointing counsel, he obtained the record of the sentencing and he made extensive findings as to what he would have done or how he would reacted, had the entries been false and had he no match, and his conclusion was that there was so much other criminal activity on the record that he would have given the same sentence in any event because the additional burglary and the additional rape did not make that much difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.135" offset="9966191">Now, that maybe true in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.429" offset="9975386">There was a lot of criminal activity, but I do not see any reason why it is too much to ask of judge Harris, who was still sitting, to make these types of findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.577" offset="10015928">I feel that he ought to have done so when the motion originally came up to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.015" offset="10033691">As Mr. Tuttle has indicated, Mr. Tucker the prisoner, and respondent here in propria persona filed a petition under Burgett versus Texas attacking the conviction itself, on the basis of what we have read at page 24 and what preceded it when the priors were introduced to impeach him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.658" offset="10112268">He did not in his original moving papers mentioned the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.535" offset="10127837">The Government did not in its reply papers mentioned the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.280" offset="10150824">The judge then wrote the opinion which is in the appendix which does not mention sentencing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.532" offset="10175797">The opinion relies heavily on the record to indicate that as far as impeachment went, there was harmless error because the man was thoroughly, Mr. Tucker was thoroughly, discredited on rebuttal evidence and this is true and then, after this opinion came down from judge Harris, Mr. Tucker filed what he labeled a petition for rehearing which goes on for several pages laying out what happened at sentencing and requesting sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.859" offset="10289064">And Mr. Tuttle has accurately described judge Harris’ response to that, a truce order saying rehearing denied, the petition raises no new issue that warrants reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.939" offset="10337443">And it was a new issue if the Court please, because instead of weighing the priors as impeaching devices against the testimony of guilt and the discrediting testimony, the judge should have then weighed the priors as evidence of guilt against the other evidence of guilt that was done in the Pat case to see if it would have made any difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3110.929" offset="12517414">I do know that the one’s that he is not on the parole out on which he is not on parole are those which are discussed in the appendix to the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.503" offset="12563703">I would like a little briefly in argument to the point made in part 3 of respondent's brief and that is that judge Harris in 1953 when he was sentencing petitioner had no way to know that petitioner had previously spent eleven-and-half-years in prison wrongfully because of unreliable convictions, convictions which were made without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.315" offset="12678955">Perhaps the judge would have want to have shown some leniency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.632" offset="12696196">Now, we have the statement at the bottom of page 35 of the Appendix, “there is no room for the Court to entertain elements of great sympathy” because Mr. Tucker was using a gun, even though he did not point it to anyone, but there was some room not for great sympathy but some and if there was only sympathy of a matter two years or three Mr. Tucker would now be have finished his sentence, it appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.645" offset="12804238">The Third Circuit cases, the District Court cases from the Third Circuit have developed a theory of relief given on 2255 in Habeas Corpus “that it is only fair and just to return a sentence to the sentencing judge for reconsideration when it appears after sentencing that the man, the defendant, has served time in prison on wrongful convictions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.422" offset="12915311">A thought as I believe to give a little mercy to make up for this wrong that has been done to him which cannot be righted in any other way and certainly insofar as fact there is retribution and deterrence of others two of the four factors that are frequently considered at sentencing, so far as they are involved, there is room for mercy because of the prior time in prison and in Mr. Tucker’s case not only was he in prison, he was on a chain gang for five-and-a-half years and what that means I do not know. One other point in respect to a passage on page 24, Mr. Chief Justice is concerning you is that Mr. Tucker in 1953 may never have consulted with an Attorney about his criminal responsibility for this 1938 robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.273" offset="13130769">Now, on the basis of my correspondence with him which I am not going to go into because there off the record, I think that he might have developed a duress defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.737" offset="13168594">If he had had the chance to talk with an attorney about this and while he admits, “I broke into it, I stole the car,” it does not negate a possible defense that would limit the criminal responsibility and not make him see less evil in the eye or less wicked in the eye of judge Harris in 1953 when sentencing occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.146" offset="13262217">Certainly, some further explanation of what happened might have been proper and also, Your Honor, in respect to the Florida conviction, the fact that he served seven-and-a-half years, a very severe sentence, might have indicated to --</text>

            <text syncTime="3353.469" offset="13487497">The remand order is appropriate and a procedure for the future that would be appropriate is to require or direct the lower Courts in this type of case to got through the motions which do not take very long and which do not require an evidentiary hearing of explaining as was done in Pat versus United States in the Fifth Circuit of explaining why there is a denial.</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan A. Tuttle</label>
            <text syncTime="3392.590" offset="13644023">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.248" offset="13650710">First Mr. Chief Justice, you asked the citation of the Vertigo case which related to the use of a evidence which had been seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, that is a Ninth Circuit case, Your Honor, it is 402 F. 2d 599.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.648" offset="13716225">With respect to petitioner's contention that at the sentencing hearing, he protested innocence and he meant to say “both,” that is to say both the 1938 Florida conviction for auto theft, and the 1950 Florida conviction for armed robbery, as I read the record and I have nothing outside the record to rely upon, it seems to me, your Honors, that what he is saying with the respect the auto theft is that was a joyride.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.409" offset="13815282">That was not grand larceny auto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.102" offset="13822073">I mean, I did it, but it was not a crime of that magnitude and that is a sense of innocence which he is asserting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.665" offset="13852375">Now, I would like to address myself very briefly to this notion of conclusiveness which Mr. Reppy has raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.814" offset="13880901">There is an extensive portion of the respondent’s brief addressed to the notion and to the rule of law that for certain purposes convictions are conclusive evidence of guilt and that arises principally in impeachment proceedings where a person is often not allowed to explain that although I was convicted I felt in fact guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.919" offset="13965329">That only arises in context where rules of evidence supply and I submit that importing conclusiveness into sentencing, a respondent commits the same error that he is attempting to do when he wants to import the rules of evidence into sentencing generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.345" offset="14023007">Whereas we would claim that the rules of evidence do not apply and any reliable information can be used, we would maintain the same with respect to any doctrine of conclusiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.030" offset="14061773">I cannot conceive of a Probation Officer, if a defendant being examined by him for the purpose of preparation of a pre-sentence report says “Yes, I have the X conviction, the Y conviction, but I did not do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.256" offset="14114645">I did not have an Attorney or I did not do it or I was under duress.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.828" offset="14128960">I think that all of the books which have been collected in respondent’s brief and all of the learning that the Court may find on the subject of sentencing in preparation of pre-sentence reports indicates that these gentleman, the Probation Officers are trained to be open minded and train to include everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.253" offset="14198655">And I do not think that doctrine of conclusiveness would ever precluded a defendant in a pre-sentence report from alleging his innocence or circumstances of mitigation and I simply feel that conclusiveness has not relevance in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3569.987" offset="14353613">With respect to matters that judge Harris considered, I would like to address myself that very briefly because Mr. Justice White you raised a question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.209" offset="14394468">I think that if you read the record, it is clear that he did not rely upon the pending federal Los Angeles indictment, but that he did rely upon the seven or eight pending state investigations, four of which did later in fact resulted in convictions and which were later collaterally attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.347" offset="14463014">So, I think that his -- the things that he did not rely upon was the situation, where there was indictment and in the judge's eyes the indictment was going to take care of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.542" offset="14495824">That there would be a prosecution in appropriate sentence, but as to those pending state proceedings, he felt that the state might prosecute or not prosecute or prosecute some and not others depending on what happened at his sentencing.</text>
