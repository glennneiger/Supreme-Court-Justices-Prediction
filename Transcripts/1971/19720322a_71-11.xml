            <text syncTime="42.573" offset="243931">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.895" offset="257201">This is one of those cases that in attempting to characterize what you are doing to your colleagues back in the office, you have a little bit of difficulty identifying exactly what it is because I hate to refer to it as the Strange case.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.655" offset="316238">What it is, is a direct appeal from the Three-Judge Court sitting in the District of Kansas which declared unconstitutional and enjoined the future enforcement of a statute passed by the 1979 Kansas legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.710" offset="376528">The statute involved, KSA 1971 sub 22-4513 is a part of the Aid to Indigent Defenders Act passed in that year by that legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.880" offset="429191">I think what happened to generate the passage of the entire Act was that the confusion that existed with regard to the manner and method of not only determination of indigency for the purposes of appointing counsel in criminal cases, but also the method of payment of counsel and some fashion caused the legislature to pass a rather comprehensive Act and that Act provides for the establishment of a Board of Supervisors to govern the administrative work of the system which is administered directly by the State's Judicial Administrator, Mr. James.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.608" offset="600137">The Board of Supervisors is authorized to cause to be accumulated a panel of attorneys in the various districts and to formulate rules and regulations for the implementation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.308" offset="658860">Once the panel of attorneys is formulated, any district judge or magistrate may rely on any attorney on that panel for providing counsel to those who he finds indigent and requiring counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.536" offset="719777">The challenged portion of the Act provides that when any expense has been advanced or paid by the state on behalf of somebody who has been found to be indigent, the state is allowed an opportunity to cause repayment to -- at least be attempt a procedure that is used in 4513, a repayment statute, is that the judicial administrator causes a notice to be sent to the person upon whose behalf the expenditure was made.</text>

            <text syncTime="214.652" offset="932310">Currently what -- no I should not say currently because this has been true through the history of the Act, each year the judicial administrator on behalf of the Supreme Court proposes a budget to the State Legislature which appropriates the money to fund the indigent program.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.484" offset="1007647">His estimate is really a guess, at least it was to start with, so in any event the money is appropriated, then the Board of Supervisors which includes the Judicial Administrator and a Justice of the State Supreme Court determine rates of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.173" offset="1070341">Currently the rates are figured at about $15 to $20 an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.205" offset="1086537">$15 an hour for out of court time and $20 an hour for in court time with a maximum of $500 in any case not involving a sentence of a life imprisonment or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.654" offset="1132303">In another words for practical purposes everything, but a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.830" offset="1152992">Also the statute authorizes the expenditure of funds to provide defense services, let us say an investigator, I would assume the transcripts would be included although I have no state decision controlling it one way or another, perhaps experts, fax or anything that the state is authorized to initially provide on the indigent defendant's behalf under the act which covers the criminal trial, the post conviction, the collateral attack, the appeal stages of the proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.891" offset="1825279">I would expect.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.437" offset="1835415">I think the, regardless of what the statute in its current form provides, under the District Court's decision, the Three-Judge Court the state would be prohibited from taking any kind of action to allow reimbursement or recoupment because what the District Court, excuse me, what the Three-Judge Court decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.769" offset="1924754">If I may refer to the court's opinion as printed on the jurisdictional statement and the appendix to the jurisdictional statement, I would like to refer to pages seven and eight of the appendix, where the Three-Judge Court on page eighty-seven says, “Hence any construction of the Kansas' statute which leaves intact the state's right to recover legal expenses from indigents is a construction which inevitably impinges upon and determines the rights protected in Gideon and the same reasoning is employed in the next page, leading us to conclude that whatever form the state might have enacted or might choose to enact in the future, would under that philosophy be an unconstitutional burden on the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.361" offset="2143137">This action was filed in a Federal Court in behalf of a plaintiff, David Strange who had been charged with a felony crime in the District Court, ultimately in the District Court of Shawnee county in the state of Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.623" offset="2208130">He was, he received the letter of demand from the Judicial Administrator notifying him of the states claim as a result of a direct outlay of $500 to his court appointed attorney, it was Mr. Wilkinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.111" offset="2274063">At that time the Federal Court action filed and ever since then the state in that case has agreed to not proceed any further and when the District Court handed down its decision, a permanent injunction restraining any enforcement of that provision of the statute was also avoided.</text>

            <text syncTime="577.987" offset="2385658">It's -- that is my understanding, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.724" offset="2416587">The issue as we see it is one that is a little bit for me to vocalize.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.249" offset="2450651">The issue stated in the brief is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.756" offset="2464653">Whether the existence of a state statutory procedure providing for the collection from an indigent defendant of moneys expended by the state to furnish him counsel constitutes an unlawful burden upon an indigent defendant's Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel and that is pretty wordy.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.309" offset="2522853">But it is difficult to approach the subject without having to do a little bit of defining what we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.570" offset="2559947">The state has attempted to treat all those who are found to be indigent equally with regard to this particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.703" offset="2616476">They, the state has attempted to treat them the same as would any civil judgment debt ought be treated in the state courts with one possible exception and that relates to the exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.358" offset="2671124">The exemptions for civil judgment debtor in a state are a little bit broader than those under the Aid to Indigent Defenders Act and the statute specifically defines what exemptions are available and what are not, and primarily the exemption is the homestead exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.799" offset="2732878">The statute is much broader, however, than simply allowing the state to take a judgment against the person found to be indigent because it authorizes in effect the setting aside of a fraudulent conveyance and an establishment of a lien against any property that might have been transferred by the indigent prior -- subsequent to the time the crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.096" offset="2865998">In trying to define what the precise issue that, the Lower Court treated, the Three-Judge Court, we have to look to the Sixth Amendment, which provides that in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to have the assistance of counsel and the precise question we ask is, what does it mean when it says the right to the assistance of counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="724.006" offset="2969652">Does it mean that the state has to provide free counsel?</text>
            <text syncTime="727.781" offset="2984803">Because that is adding a word that is not in the constitution and in the decisions of this Court relating to the right to counsel, when this Court speaks in terms of protecting the Sixth Amendment right to counsel by providing counsel or seeing that the defendant at a criminal trial has the opportunity to be heard by a counsel, does that mean that the state has to bear the expense of providing that counsel under all circumstances?</text>
            <text syncTime="757.683" offset="3104444">It is a state's position that at the time the criminal defendant is tried in the State of Kansas under the Aid to Indigent Defenders Act, the constitutional right to counsel is protected.</text>

            <text syncTime="1165.774" offset="4736783">but my assessment of what is occurring would be that because of other reasons, our judges are getting much more careful about examining persons who allege they are indigent for the purposes of appointing an attorney and the primary reason is that the increase in the number of representations by attorneys in court appointed cases has increased so much in the last three to four years that the courts are becoming very, are much more seriously inquiring as to the indigency status than they ever did before and that approach is implemented even more by the statute, which the current statute which is in another, current Act, excuse me, which is another provision specifically authorizes the trial judge if he wishes in his discretion to require the indigent applicant to file an affidavit setting out certain information concerning his finances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2009.426" offset="8111386">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.662" offset="8136359">I suppose that I am the one who failed to tell David Strange that I was not free court appointed counsel and consequently, I felt morally obligated to carry his cause pretty much at my expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.495" offset="8231653">When I first confronted David Strange in the jail, I was under the impression that I was free court appointed counsel and had the statute had been called, had I known about the statute at that time, the statute became effective July 1, I think I was called on July 10, 1969, some nine days later, ten days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.880" offset="8337188">I perhaps would have done essentially the same thing I did after I plead David Strange guilty under Ex parte royal which I believe Mr. Justice Brennan decided in the favor of (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.184" offset="8390373">I would have attempted to stop the criminal proceedings at that time because contrary to what Mr. Chief Justice Burger has said he thought he would take judicial notice at, I think it is important for a young man to be advised and particularly in this young man's circumstances where he is guilty or committed his first offense to be given a chance again, and that is what he has been grappling with in his own situations from a family of 11 children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.327" offset="8550974">He had a brother who was in the hospital for the criminally insane who set a bad example for him when he ran away from the (Inaudible) state hospital and got him into trouble in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.744" offset="8596636">After I have plead him guilty to his offense David Strange got a job and he is working today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.938" offset="8621400">He has a marginal existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.509" offset="8631745">He does not need this $500 judgment or any judgment against him, but he is gainfully occupied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.770" offset="8656718">He is taking care of his wife, he is taking care of his baby.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.702" offset="8672496">This $500 judgment at the time that was to be levied against him on February fourth 1970 I believe would have put him in the ranks of the people who could not honestly apply for a job because he was judgment for material, he was legal fee material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.018" offset="8765701">His work would have required -- his judgment against him would have caused his employer to expend legal fees on his behalf just to meet garnishment problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.751" offset="8832679">Now the state says and has said all along that there is only the five years involved but they can renew this judgment by a simple matter at the clerk of District Courts office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.161" offset="8886282">So whether if he has five years or twenty years, it is a matter of levying execution, returning to execution unsatisfied.</text>
