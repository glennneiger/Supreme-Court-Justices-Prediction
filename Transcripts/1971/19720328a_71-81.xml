            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73725">We’ll hear first in No. 71-81, United States against Biswell.</text>

            <label>Mr. R. Kent Greenawalt</label>
            <text syncTime="11.193" offset="118447">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.172" offset="134329">This case is on review of the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit that an agent of the Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Division of the Treasury Department searched respondent Biswell’s business premises in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.755" offset="196709">The issue involved is a narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.749" offset="208621">Whether Congress in regulating the distribution of firearms, may authorize treasury agents to make routine inspections during business hours of the business premises of licensed dealers in firearms and whether Congress may impost upon these licensed dealers a duty to admit the agents even though the agents do not possess a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.460" offset="303498">Putting the question somewhat differently, thus the congressional authorization of such inspections and the imposition of a duty upon licensed dealers to admit the agents without warrants conflict with the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.509" offset="363684">We believe the constitutionality of the authorization and the duty Congress has imposed is plain under Colonnade Catering Corporation versus United States and that therefore the court below erred.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.909" offset="425333">The relevant facts in this case are quite straight forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.193" offset="438394">Loarn Anthony Biswell is a pawnbroker in Hobbs, New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.269" offset="454799">A substantial number of the items pawned with him as security for loans are firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.006" offset="477683">At the time of the inspection here he held some 444 firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.929" offset="497431">Biswell was a licensed dealer of firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.983" offset="509656">Under Section 923 of Title 18, dealers and firearms must be licensed and dealers who are explicitly defined to include pawnbrokers.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.074" offset="549989">Special Investigator Hupp of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Division made a routine compliance visit to Biswell’s pawnshop.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.890" offset="589278">According to Hupp, such visits of dealers are made about once a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.563" offset="607877">Hupp identified himself and first inquired about Biswell’s records.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.089" offset="626058">He ascertained that Biswell was not keeping records in the form required of all firearms dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.819" offset="648941">Hupp then indicated that he wish to see the storerooms where the firearms were kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.697" offset="668481">Biswell kept these along with other pawned items in a locked storage room.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.822" offset="688961">Biswell inquired if Hupp got a search warrant and Hupp said no but he showed Biswell a copy of the statute authorizing treasury agents to search the business premises of firearms dealers without warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.233" offset="738594">At that point, Biswell said, well, that’s what it says so I guess it is okay and he unlocked the storeroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.225" offset="774538">Inside the storeroom, Hupp saw a rifle with an 11 and 3 quarter inch barrel.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.447" offset="799511">Any rifle with a barrel of less than 16 inches is an illegal firearm under the National Firearms Act of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.321" offset="834933">That Act does not absolutely forbid possession of such firearms but sharply constricts a rightful possession and commerce in such firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.059" offset="873908">Each set of firearm must have serial number, each dealer in such firearms must pay a special occupational tax and be specially registered with the Secretary of the Treasury and whenever any such firearm is transferred, the transferor must pay a $200.00 transfer tax and obtain approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.306" offset="962933">It was clear to Agent Hupp that Biswell did not legally possess the sort of rifle he saw.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.990" offset="985607">There was no required serial number on the rifle.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.817" offset="996892">Biswell indicated that he had no idea such weapons had to be specially registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.438" offset="1015387">Finally, it was obvious that no owner would pay transfer tax of $200.00 to get a $3.00 loan although of course Hupp didn’t know the amount of the loan but he knew it was much less than $200.00 from a pawnbroker.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.375" offset="1063139">Soon after seeing this rifle, Hupp noticed another with a short barrel and he seize both rifles.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.676" offset="1092396">The District Judge denied a motion to suppress the two sort of rifles and they were introduced at Biswell’s trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.129" offset="1118205">They in the observations of them by Agent Hupp irrelevant to the count for which Biswell was convicted, engaging as a dealer on illegal firearms without having paid this special occupational tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.372" offset="1167211">Among other claims on appeal, Biswell asserted that the search leading to the seizure of the rifles was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.500" offset="1195632">The Court of Appeals agreed that the search was unconstitutional and that the evidence should’ve been suppressed and it reversed the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.687" offset="1228442">I think it may be useful that the outset to put aside what is not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.392" offset="1251221">There is no assertion by Biswell that Hupp performed other than routine actions under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.268" offset="1274731">It is not disputed that he was engaged in the periodic compliance visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.891" offset="1293225">It is not disputed that such visits typically involved inspection of the firearms on the premises and if the entry into the storeroom was valid, the appropriateness of the seizure of the two clearly contraband weapons is not challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.980" offset="1357591">At the same time it is clear that Biswell unlocked the door of the storeroom because he acquiesced in an apparent show of the lawful authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.980" offset="1393640">In an ordinary criminal investigation, his action would not of constituted consent to an otherwise unauthorize search.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.103" offset="1430107">Thus, we do not argue that this search was consented to in the ordinary sense of consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.461" offset="1467514">The case thus presents very clearly, the power of Congress to authorize treasury agents responsible for enforcement of the firearms laws to authorize those agents to inspect the business premises of firearms dealers without warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.103" offset="1534074">Both the Criminal Code and the Internal Revenue Code contain a multiplicity of regulations governing the sale and distribution of firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.111" offset="1566153">I take it there can be no question of the importance of close regulation of the gun industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.738" offset="1588618">Approximately 60% of the murders in the country by use of firearms as are 95% of the killings of police officers on duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.467" offset="1627593">The power of Congress to require licenses in registration and to tax this incidence of the gun industry has been consistently upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.037" offset="1669807">That power is not questioned in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.730" offset="1684644">As a central aspect of the regulatory scheme, Section 923 (g) of Title 18 provides for inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.653" offset="1724246">The relevant language for this case is “The Secretary may enter during business hours the premises including places of storage of any firearms or ammunition dealer for the purpose of inspecting any firearms or ammunition kept or stored by such dealer at such premises.”</text>
            <text syncTime="435.896" offset="1817242">The clear import of this section is the treasury agents need not have a warrant to inspect and that licensed dealers have a duty under the statute to permit inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.888" offset="1869173">This Section is virtually identical with the Section considered by this Court in Colonnade Catering Corporation versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.707" offset="1912536">In Colonnade, this Court held with three dissents that Congress had not authorized entry by physical force without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.588" offset="1948063">The significance of that case for this one however, is in the Court’s reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.907" offset="1969274">The Court acknowledged that treasury agents have been given broad authority to enter and inspect the premises of liquor dealers and it determined that this authority is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.644" offset="2016295">Both the majority and the dissenters agree that the rule of Camara versus Municipal Court and See versus City of Seattle was inapplicable to that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.496" offset="2055687">That rule of course is the one that requires a warrant for administrative search that has not been consented to but as I have said all justice, all of the justices agreed that that was --</text>

            <text syncTime="613.787" offset="2528817">There were old statutes before the constitution was adopted that prohibited concealed weapons and state regulation of the gun industry has proceeded in this century and there were federal laws on the book as early as 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.540" offset="2591825">So when you say recent, it isn’t the last few years but it certainly is.</text>

            <text syncTime="638.251" offset="2626724">The history isn’t of that such close regulation as existed with respect to liquor industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.690" offset="2644383">It is our contention however that reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment in this context in determining what kinds of inspection require warrants has to be determined with the view toward an evolving society and the needs of the society at this time and we do not see how it can be said that despite the greater history of regulation of the liquor industry that the need for inspection is greater in regard to liquor than it is with respect to lethal weapons and so are -- and I think that’s borne out by the findings of Congress in passing the most recent legislation in 1968.</text>

            <text syncTime="798.272" offset="3266724">First of all, unlike the ordinary homeowner or the person who had business premises in a sea, this is not a citizen who is just subject to searches that happen to every homeowner or every owner of a business office.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.128" offset="3346136">This is someone who’s licensed in a particular industry and a very closely regulated industry who knows who the authorities are that have power to inspect, what agency it is that’s regulating the gun industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.687" offset="3404442">So that -- first of all, when an agent of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms unit shows up at his premises he is virtually certain that there is proper authority in that officer to inspect assuming that there isn’t a problem I think that there was in Camara or in See that somebody might show up in the -- the homeowner or the warehouse owner wouldn’t know whether this fellow really had the power to make a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.895" offset="3517291">Secondly and I supposed this is quite crucial, this is not like an ordinary administrative inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.076" offset="3549996">If there is a fire hazard, faulty wiring or defective elevator and the inspector shows up and says I want to check your wiring, I want to look at your elevators, if entry is refused it’s unlikely that the condition is going to be corrected within three or four hours or however long it would take to get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.468" offset="3631498">If the condition is corrected, the substantial purpose of the administrative regulation is achieved since the substantial purposes to correct the wiring or to get the elevator on proper working order and that just isn’t true here in respect to these inspections.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.103" offset="3710074">When the inspector shows up, if he has to go for a couple of hours to get a warrant, a gun dealer can just put aside whatever weapons may be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.709" offset="3752497">The inspector comes back with his warrant, he makes the inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.237" offset="3766603">He doesn’t find the guns and then the gun dealer puts the weapons back in their place, I mean the entire purpose of the inspection would be forwarded.</text>

            <text syncTime="1060.087" offset="4314025">I think at that point, he saw a copy of the regulations that certainly Biswell have been notified of the content of the statute and had received the regulations indicating both what the substantive regulations were and the power of the agents of the division to search his premises, inspect his premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="1424.191" offset="5770404">Well, you do not have the specific language that you have in Colonnade but we think that that really is surplusage that the clear implication of that provision is that the agents have authority to enter and that therefore the dealer has the duty to allow them to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.503" offset="5839681">Even if we were wrong about that in terms of whether it’s criminally punishable whether 924 spells out the criminal sanction with such clarity that a refusal to allow entry would be a criminal violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.407" offset="5895269">We still think it’s clear that the import of the statute is that under the statute, dealers are supposed to allow entry and so then we view that by saying that you have a duty which might result in loss of license, might not result in criminal sanctions but nevertheless a duty illegally imposed by Congress so that once you do allow the entry that’s an acquiescence and a lawful duty imposed by Congress and that makes the inspection proper and that the fruits of the inspection therefore admissible in evidence in the criminal trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1521.418" offset="6159315">Well, I deal briefly with the point that is raised in the amicus brief by Civil Liberties Union if the inspection was lawful we think it is clear that the evidence is admissible in a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.116" offset="6206127">Again, going back to Colonnade, that evidence presumably would have been admissible in a criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.782" offset="6232772">The evidence was suppressed in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.266" offset="6242698">There were criminal sanctions as they are here for the violation of the regulations in Colonnade as well as here and this Court has always assumed that contraband found in the course of a lawful inspection can properly be introduced in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.899" offset="6353248">In short, in summary, it is our position that Colonnade dictates reversal of the decision below unless the major reasoning of that opinion is to be repudiated or the gun industry regulation of the gun industry is to be distinguished from regulation of the liquor industry and we urge very strongly that in light of present social conditions, it must be that Congress has as much power over the gun industry in these terms as it does over the liquor industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="1614.426" offset="6531403">Mr. Chief Justice and if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.942" offset="6557421">Our position is far as issue one is concerned in the petition brief is that not only does the gun inspection statute violate the Fifth Amendment rights of the respondent, I mean the Fourth Amendment, it also violates the Fifth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.717" offset="6628579">That by forcing upon him the obligation to allow inspection he thereby incriminates himself of any criminal acts are discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.219" offset="6674554">At the outset, I would like to point out to the Court that this came up, I don’t believe that it was relevant to the argument before the Court but I would like to point out that Mr. Biswell was found innocent for possession charges of the guns and found guilty of not being licensed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.274" offset="6766819">So query, what did the jury believe?</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.225" offset="6778522">I believe we are all confused about that outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.170" offset="6790329">But getting to the constitutional question, actually what the petitioner is advocating here is the same thing that Franks did which this Court overruled later that is create an additional exception to general rule under the constitution that there must be a search warrant with probable cause before you can search not only private homes but the private portions of the premises of businessmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.887" offset="6917180">And in Frank as the Court recalls the Court in that case said well, if this is an administrative search which is essentially civil in nature, no criminal investigation that there are safeguards then we will allow such a search and call it to be constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.686" offset="7016445">The -- this Court in the Colonnade case which See followed as far as commercial premises are concerned indicated otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.637" offset="7072243">At the outset I would like to point out that it is the respondent’s feeling that there is a much greater issue facing this Court today other than just the gun statute which is a subject to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.325" offset="7134936">As the petitioner cited in his brief, in his footnotes, there are some dozen pieces of federal legislation existing today which call for inspection of premises of businessmen all the way from poultry, drugs onto to a new act which we have now the National Safety and Health Practices Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.429" offset="7239426">Now, prior to the enactment of this Act most of these acts where a specialized area of business and probably didn’t step on the toes of these many people as this new Act will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.376" offset="7287178">This Act covers all employers whose businesses are engaged in commerce and it contains penalties of up to $20,000.00 in one year for violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2604.471" offset="10491567">Mr. Chief Justice, we don’t expect the Court or ask the Court in this case to uphold the inspection provisions of every federal statute that provides for inspection without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.898" offset="10549245">We do think that there may be differences and their differences in the practices now, for instance, I am told that in regard during inspections of food, that there’s never been any problem because they would simply stop inspecting the food if the inspections weren’t permitted and then I suppose the food will be harder to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.852" offset="10621029">The FDA has informs people that they have a right not to consent to a search without a warrant and goes out and gets warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.425" offset="10663348">It’s acting in accord with the holding of Camara and See, and the considerations there may be quite different and they are in the gun industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2738.142" offset="11026241">In any event, we think that the relevant factors are whether somebody has knowingly undertaken an obligation as a licensee, the reasonableness of the regulation whether there’s a narrow and falsely regulated industry so that the authority of the inspector is known and the person knows the area to be inspected, how great the invasion of privacy is here -- reached on the business premises and whether there is a need for surprise as there are -- as there is this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2809.707" offset="11312543">The only line -- there is no language to that effect but there are very substantial criminal penalties for a variety of acts and there is a provision that the Secretary can enter the premises during business hours to inspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.256" offset="11370744">Now, I would think that an ordinary, reasonable businessman would know that if criminal violation is found during an inspection he is in serious trouble and maybe prosecutor and that the agent, he is going to testify as to what he found in the inspection and is going to produce any contraband that was seized at that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2863.754" offset="11528732">Yes, it would be noble rule to say that the contraband which is properly seized cannot be introduced in the prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2884.664" offset="11612324">It says you can seize them because they are contraband but because of the self protection and of course you can’t admit them in a criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.028" offset="11637820">That as far as I know is without support of any opinion that’s been written on the Court in the majority or in the dissent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2912.246" offset="11722665">Why should you be able to use it to revoke a license if you can’t use it in a criminal prosecution?</text>

            <text syncTime="2923.168" offset="11766342">You don’t think really you could distinguish between permitting a search for the purpose of enforcing the obligations of a licensee and yet not permitting the evidence to be used in a criminal prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2940.793" offset="11836873">Well, first of all that would be inconsistent with anything this Court has ever said about the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.713" offset="11860487">And there are -- the Zap case which is cited in our brief is an example of inspection without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.803" offset="11884834">They are consented to by contract and in which it was introduced in the criminal trial and that’s been the assumption of every holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.427" offset="11923390">Practically, the result of the rule, that kind of rule in this area would be to require the Government to get warrants, I think it would -- since these are very serious violations of the criminal law in most of the weapons that are forbidden under the National Firearms Act for the things like machine guns and bombs and hand grenade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.677" offset="11996429">In addition, the sort of rifles and shot guns and if the Government upon finding that could not be used as evidence in a criminal trial, it would certainly defeat the purpose of the inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.063" offset="12041882">I might -- just one point in answer to Mr. Justice Marshall’s point that Colonnade statute did not contain any language of the client that you suggested either and so I again would say this case is governed by Colonnade on that.</text>
