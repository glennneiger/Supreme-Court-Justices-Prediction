            <text syncTime="44.546" offset="251892">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.344" offset="271014">This case is here on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which denied enforcement of the board's bargaining order.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.068" offset="313959">The question presented is whether an employer violates his bargaining obligation under the National Labor Relations Act by refusing to bargain with the Union representative of his employees about the changes in health benefits which the employer proposes to negotiate with employees who have already retired.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.646" offset="420225">Now the basic facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.805" offset="432868">Since 1949, local one of the Allied Chemical Workers of America has been the bargaining representative for all hourly employees at the Barberton, Ohio plant of the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.061" offset="505907">In 1950, the Union and the company negotiated a contract which for the first time included provisions for pension and hospitalization and surgical insurance plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.491" offset="563690">At the same time the parties orally agreed that the employees who retired could participate in the medical plan by contributing the entire cost of the insurance premium which would be deducted from their pensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.379" offset="627219">In 1959, retiree benefits under the plan were improved and as a result of contract negotiations 1962, the medical insurance plan became contributory for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.112" offset="690122">The company agreeing to two dollars towards the cost of insurance premiums for employees who retired in future.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.022" offset="729724">This was available to both the retiree and spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.393" offset="747278">At the same time a change was made in the pension plan to make 65 the mandatory retirement age.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.232" offset="782596">A new contract was negotiated in 1964 and that forms the basis for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.931" offset="813420">At that time the company agreed to increase its monthly contribution of medical insurance from two dollars to four dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.847" offset="853022">The increase was made available not only to employees who retired after the effective date of the contract, but also to each participating employer or employee in the health plan, who had retired on or after the effective date of the 1962 contract, in other words it went back indefinitely to reach employees who had already retired.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.813" offset="972976">In anticipation of the enactment of Medicare, however, the agreement further provided that the company could rescind the two-dollar increase in its contribution, if a government health program were enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.810" offset="1040895">Now, Congress enacted Medicare on July 30, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.357" offset="1067121">This contract as I said was negotiated in 1964 and by its terms it had until October of 1967, before it would terminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.434" offset="1131383">In November of 1965, the Union asked the company to engaged in bargaining for the purpose of negotiating insurance benefits not covered by Medicare.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.157" offset="1198361">The company responded several months later by stating that the because of enactment of Medicare it intended to rescind the two-dollar extra contribution that it was making to the health insurance plan and it intended as a matter of fact to cancel the medical insurance plan for retirees entirely because the enactment of Medicare would render the company insurance plan useless.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.341" offset="1335033">Instead the company said that it would pay the three-dollars per month subscription cost of supplemental Medicare for each retired employee who elected that and decided to leave the company plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.699" offset="1452480">The Union conceded that under the contract, the Company by virtue of its reservation had the right to reduce its contribution to the health and welfare plan from four dollars to two dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.524" offset="1535758">However, the Union vigorously protested the company’s further action in canceling the company plan all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.431" offset="1599393">And the Union further inquired what provision did the company intend to make for those pensioners and their wives who are under 65 and not eligible for Medicare at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.948" offset="1669505">The company challenged the Union’s right to bargain about retirees and acknowledged that there was a problem about the pensioner who would not -- or were not eligible for 65 and said that they have to think about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.460" offset="1727497">Several days later, the company informed the Union that it would not cancel the medical plan for retired employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.889" offset="1761247">Instead it would write each retiree notifying of the pendency of Medicare and indicating that it would give it the option for either remaining under the company plan with reduced contribution of two-dollars on the part of the company or getting out of the company plan in which case the company would pay the three-dollars supplemental Medicare subscriptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.425" offset="1895412">The Union objected on the ground that such change should be the matter of negotiations and could not be done unilaterally by the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.965" offset="1953508">The company took the position, the reiterated position and said we will not apply the matter and went ahead and bid to contact the retirees individually about the offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.649" offset="2004290">As a result out of 15 out of the 190 retirees availed itself of the company's option, the remainder remained under the old plan with the reduced employee contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.383" offset="2063223">The Union thereupon filed charges with the board alleging that the company's refusal to bargain about the changes in the health plan for the retirees violated the company's bargaining obligation under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.859" offset="2133126">The Board sustained the complaint which is an issued by the Board's general counsel, agreeing with the Union's contention that company had violated its bargaining obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.998" offset="2193626">There were two basis for the Board's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.716" offset="2204597">First of all that retirees remained employees under the act for purposes of their retirement benefits and secondly that even if they were not employees, there was the duty to bargain about this matter because changes in retirement benefits had a direct and vital impact on the terms and conditions of the employment of the active employees as to whom there was clearly a bargaining obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.809" offset="2308878">The Board entered an appropriate order.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.688" offset="2320477">The Six Circuit denied enforcement of the Board’s order and we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.534" offset="2347853">Now we submit that the Six Circuit erred for two basic reasons which I will try to develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.174" offset="2398426">Section 8 (a) (5) and 8 (d) of the National Labor Relations Act imposes on the employer and the representative of his employees the obligation to bargain with each other in good faith with respect to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.817" offset="2472927">By now it is well established that employers are obligated to bargain with Union representative about pensions and insurance benefits to be enjoyed by active employees upon their retirement and indeed a large percentage of Union represented employees are currently working under negotiated pensions and retirement plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.694" offset="2588493">However, experience and the facts of this case show that retirement benefits once negotiated do not remain static, but they are subject to unanticipated events even after the employee has retired.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.288" offset="2670831">Monetary inflation is one obvious unanticipated event.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.236" offset="2690579">The other one, a change in public law, in this case illustrates that because at the time that the parties originally hammered out a health insurance plan nobody contemplated what effect Medicare would have on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.073" offset="2761946">So the question presented here is whether when these changes are to be made in the benefits of employees that have retired, the employer must bargain with the Union on behalf of the employees, of the retired employees about those changes just as it did with the Union when they were originally negotiated or whether it is one of the three and act unilateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.466" offset="2891513">Now this Court in the Fiber Board case indicated that industrial practice in this country is a very important consideration in determining whether a matter is a mandatory subject of collective bargaining and further the amenability of the subject to the collective bargaining processes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.617" offset="2984196">This experience we submit, supports the Board's conclusion, the changes in retiree benefits are a mandatory subject of collective bargaining because as shown in the amicus brief that has been filed by the AFL and CIO and by the Senior Citizen's Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.973" offset="3077610">Employers and unions have for many years regularly and consistently bargained not only about the pension and retirement benefits for active employees to be enjoyed upon their retirement, but also upon improvements in the benefits for employees who have already retired.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="778.444" offset="3187428">Yes You Honor I think that that is basic to the Board's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.781" offset="3224836">That was certainly the basis on which the pension and retirement benefits were held for active employee to be enjoyed upon retirement was found to be within wages, hours and terms and conditions and to carry that to retirees is just a what we submit as a natural progression, it is a part of the wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.510" offset="3323683">Now both the company and the Union however arrived at a contrary conclusion, principally in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.211" offset="3354508">They say Section 8 (a) (5) of the Act requires the employer to bargain with the representative of his employees, subject to the provisions of Section 9 (a) which in turn makes the representative selected by a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit, the exclusive representative of all the employees in the Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.216" offset="3450534">Now since retirees are no longer on the payroll of the employer and the Board does not permit them to vote in a representation election, the argument runs they cannot be regarded as his employees or employees in such units within the meaning of Section 8 (a) (5) and Section 9 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="870.717" offset="3556591">We submit that there is not warrant for such a restrictive interpretation of the terms employee and unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.592" offset="3596088">However, if we prevail on our first argument, namely that there is a duty to bargain about the benefits paid to retirees because of the direct impact that it has on the benefits of the active employees, we do not even have to reach the, what is the principle thrust of the opinion of the Court of Appeals and of the company here.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.739" offset="3716669">That comes in only on the second prong to the Board's argument, namely that in any event a retiree still remains employee for purposes of the retirement benefit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1325.106" offset="5374086">The company, there is no question is required to bargain with the Union, respecting their wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1361.136" offset="5518178">This Court's decision in the Oliver case, we submit, establishes the proposition -- the contrary proposition because in Oliver as the Court will recall, it held that a bargaining unit, including an overwhelming majority of concededly employed drivers of carry your own equipment was entitled under Section 8 (b) of the National Labor Relation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.414" offset="5635311">The bargain to impasse concerning the minimum rentals to be received by owner-drivers when they became leasees of the carrier and as the Court explained in the Drum case, it is holding in Oliver, said “it was not necessary to determine whether the owner-drivers were employees protected by the Act since the establishment of the minimal rental to them was integral to the establishment of a stable wage structure were clearly covered employee drivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.344" offset="5791105">Now we submit here that so here the benefits paid to retirees are integral to the establishment of the terms and conditions of employment are clearly covered active employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="1513.725" offset="6128607">Well when we say immediate threat to wages I think that is where we would differ with the company here because the adjustments that are made in the benefits for retired employees directly affect the bargain that is going to be made for the active employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.606" offset="6212095">If the adjustments made for retirees are too liberal, as obviously it is going to be less in the path where the active employees because the employers generally allocate a certain amount for their total labor cost fixed beyond that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.752" offset="6280744">The active employee being aware of these unanticipated changes is going to look to what the retiree is getting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.640" offset="6336228">If there is a history in this plan of negotiation to improve the retirement benefits, the active employees will might well be willing to settle for a fixed retirement plan and a mandatory retirement age, living the negotiations, the ironing out of the unanticipated events develop in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.968" offset="6437584">If there is not this history of bargaining or this possibility of bargaining, the chances are that the active employees are going to insist upon some kind of a flexible retirement plan where the cost of living escalates across.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.785" offset="6496829">This is going to make it much harder to get a bargain for the active employees so that there is a very close relationship here between the bargaining for the active employees and the adjustment in retiree benefits.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mortimer Riemer</label>
            <text syncTime="1818.628" offset="7348212">Yes indeed, they do, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.042" offset="7361900">I could mention many that do and it is a definite program of many Unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.276" offset="7386769">This small independent Union had never been able to bear the financial cost of such a program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.340" offset="7415086">What I want to say Mr. Chief Justice and to the members of the Court is that from 1950 down to 1964, this insurance program was a negotiated program and it usually reached at or about the time collective bargain negotiations were entered into and adjustments were made to the pension agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.088" offset="7518008">So it was not a loose and formal arrangement, but it was a firmly bargained arrangement, particularly the 1962 and the 1964 agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.877" offset="7569208">Now in 1962 and I think this the most significant, when the collective bargaining agreement was negotiated, when changes were made and the pension agreement, the company exacted from the Union a promise as part of the collective bargaining agreement that retirement would become mandatory at the age 65, effective in 1964 and at that point it seems to me the Union members must look to the Union, the retiree must look to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.782" offset="7712777">For some quid pro if I am going to be forced to retire when I reach the age of 65 then at least I must look to the Union to be sure the bargain for program on surgical benefits, on hospitalizations benefits is going to be carried out and if there are going to be any changes in what the Union bargained for me, since I must retire at the age of 65 then I must rely upon the Union to accomplish those changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.741" offset="7848614">But what happened in between 1950 and 1964 as I related was consistent with what was happening throughout the entire industrial movement and this brings me to one point that I should like to make, and that is to deprive what I think is a misleading effort on the part of the company to challenge the statistics and studies which have been included in the briefs of the Board and the brief the Union and then the amici briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.911" offset="7989361">We think we had the right, we think we had the right to call to this Court's attention of luminous studies of the Department of Labor, other authentic information, showing the growth of the industrial practice of bargaining about hospitalization and surgical benefits for retirees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.621" offset="8076193">And under to this Court's decision in Vaca against Sipes and in Fiberboard I think there is ample authority to sustain what was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.436" offset="8127393">The 1964 agreement, Your Honor, was a firmly bargained agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.398" offset="8159262">It had three years to go, expiring in 1967 and supplementing that collective bargaining agreement was the insurance agreement in the appendix was co-terminus, this too had three years to run, subject only to a deficiency if you want to call it that, that effective with Medicare, the company would reclaim the two-dollar additional contribution which it had agreed to 1964 and so it is understandable with the approaching effective date of Medicare and its impact upon the active employees now retiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.217" offset="8342537">The Union was in a position to inquire and asked did the company proposed to do, come July 1966 when Medicare became effective?</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.905" offset="8409306">The Union had bargained for these benefits for these people when they were active.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.862" offset="8437100">The benefits were being enjoyed now that they were retired and they have assumed a continuing responsibility to these retired employees which could not be awaited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.339" offset="8495092">And so in November 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.438" offset="8503451">This was an entirely plausible and understandable and I think correct from the Trade Union point of view, inquiry to make of a company, what you propose to do in 1966 when Medicare becomes effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.964" offset="8565518">The company replied, we are going to cancel because Medicare has made this program useless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.491" offset="8599686">We are going to take back the two dollars and we are going to contribute three dollars to Medicare.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.088" offset="8622047">This was challenged sharply by the Union and had it not been at that point, had it not been for the challenge of the Union, the entire company program in Barberton would have been canceled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.944" offset="8681502">Not only retirees eligible for social security would have lost the advantage of their insurance, but retirees who are not eligible for social security or Medicare because they were below the age of 65 and their spouses too would have lost their insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.902" offset="8753286">But for the intervening and necessary act of the Union this was prevented and two days later the company came in with a new program of no cancellation, but refusing to consider or discuss with the Union any modification of the insurance program effective on Medicare became -- went into effect in July of 1966.</text>

            <text syncTime="3465.557" offset="13935876">This is the way they presented below and this is the basis on which the court below decided it and incidentally we could add I think very little to the analysis of the court below simply here repeating I think arguments that have already been made by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.544" offset="14003899">We think it covers the case in the most excellent fashion and there is very little that I can say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.928" offset="14033365">Now, let me just say about the Oliver case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.596" offset="14056039">Well, certainly they do try to get a lot of millage out of Oliver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.746" offset="14072653">They are saying that -- and Oliver of course was a case where the Union had a legitimate interest as this Court found in saying that it's job -- that their jobs as drivers were not eroded by phony arrangements made with driver-owners, and therefore the Union and the company made an agreement that the amounts paid to these owner-drivers would not be below a certain minimum, that was just to project the erosion of the jobs in that bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.832" offset="14189055">Those owner-drivers presented a direct threat to the jobs of these employee drivers and this Court so hell in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.015" offset="14229701">Now to say that to these retirees who have no bargaining strings whatsoever who are not competing for jobs, they are not competing for wages that they present such as threat to these active employees who have the power to shut down this operation anytime to get their demands and say that these retirees threat them so much that the actives have to have control over their benefits, I think becomes almost absurd argument and I do not think that Oliver, it was intended to go that far at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.407" offset="14371285">In no case prior to this has a Board ever come to this Court or any other court, had made the argument that a Union has the exclusive right to represent people who are not in the bargaining unit and the Board it made sure that retirees are not in the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.362" offset="14447144">In fact the Board has uniformly excluded them for all bargain units saying they do not have a community interest with the active employees and probably they are not employees at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.993" offset="14485701">They have excluded them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3659.363" offset="14711086">The Board is arguing here today and I believe for the first time that bargaining unit does not control the scope of the bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.836" offset="14749015">It does not necessary control the scope of the bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.128" offset="14766152">This I think it is basic to this case and this is a change of position on the part of Board, the position it took in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.719" offset="14808575">In the Court below the Board conceded that the obligation to bargain is limited to bargaining unit and that position is supported by a long line, unbroken line of decisions by the Board itself and by the courts and is supported by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.622" offset="14892166">I did not cite Section 8 (b) (3) in the appendix to read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.353" offset="14911079">I didn't cite 8 (a) (5) which says that the employer's bargaining obligation is to bargain with the representative of his employees subject to Section 9 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.368" offset="14959144">Section 8 (b) (3) says same thing with respect to Unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.842" offset="14981087">It says that a Union bargains subject to Section 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.828" offset="15005015">That as the Court said, the Second Circuit said in the one of the two ILA cases where the ILA tried to force a company or the shipping companies in New York to bargain for Longshoremen in Florida and other places which were not in the same bargaining unit a.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.509" offset="15091742">The Board went into court in that case and got an injunction against that strike and later held that it was a violation of the Act to try to force bargaining outside the bargain unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.056" offset="15141897">And in that case, I believe it judge friendly who said, Section 9 fixes the framework within which labor and management are required to bargain and the Court of Appeals here in the second ILA case under similar circumstances held the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.636" offset="15224235">It said that the extent of the bargaining obligation is determined by certification of the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.540" offset="15251820">That is precisely what the Act itself says in Section 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.271" offset="15270733">Now, the Board would have to concede here that people who have retired permanently and no longer are employed or employment services are not in the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.566" offset="15323918">The Board does not pay as I understand, in fact these people are in the bargaining unit, that they project here an entirely new argument that a Union can under certain circumstances not clearly defined demand bargaining for people who are not in the bargaining unit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3874.669" offset="15572395">Now, it seems to me whether Congress designed the Act, designed it around the theory of industrial democracy and the employees in groupings that the Board would determine which are called bargaining units that they would select by a majority vote their representative and that representative would then represent all of them exclusively in that unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3900.869" offset="15677198">But by like token that representative was not intended to have any authority to represent anyone who was not in that unit for which it had been selected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.797" offset="15720875">Now in this particular case the Board has certified the unit back in 1949 in which it excluded which it limited the unit to active working employees and not include those pensioners and then allowed them to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.252" offset="15786704">But that is in accordance with the Board's uniform policy which they followed in every case in which this issue has ever come up and they are saying today in their brief that they still would not allow retired people to vote or be a part of a bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.466" offset="15859533">They say that they do not have a community of interest with these active people sufficient to allow them to be in the same bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.364" offset="15887118">And yet inconsistently it seems to me they are still arguing that the bargaining unit representative is their exclusive representative so this is representation without any voice in the selection of the Union or provisions in the Act whereby a Union can be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.480" offset="15955559">They have no voice in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.512" offset="15963709">They have no voice in this particular Union in ratifying agreements that are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3977.706" offset="15984503">Now, it may well be that Unions would not as a matter of fact just want to try to injure retirees.</text>

            <text syncTime="4011.459" offset="16119504">I think regardless of arguments about the right to fair representation and arguments that the unions are altruistic and all those things which they are, nevertheless the opportunity would still exist and we could not say and I do not believe anyone could say that it would not happen that a Union might under certain circumstances act to the determent of these people who have no economic strength of their own because they scattered all over, those 190 people in several different states and some are even in Yugoslavia today where they are obviously would not have any economic strength in this picture as the court below pointed out.</text>

            <text syncTime="5035.666" offset="20216339">And things that today are routinely accepted as bargainable in 1935 or even in 1947 were looked at as being unheard of extension, but the concept does grow and we submit that this a reasonable extension of the holding in Inland Steel in 1947 that the whole matter of pensions and health and welfare matters are part of matter.</text>
