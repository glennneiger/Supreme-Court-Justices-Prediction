            <text syncTime="25.326" offset="174965">Five years ago, last month the Director of Corrections in California adopted a new regulation regarding prison law library.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.573" offset="211954">It was in response to a certain problem he faced.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.842" offset="228986">In two of the three institutions under his control there were few or any law books at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.804" offset="256885">In two of them, San Clinton and Folsom there had over the years accumulated a rather rugged collection of law books mostly case reports and mostly more than 10 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.497" offset="315608">Of course such obsolete law books were worst than to assist.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.015" offset="329714">They were potentially dangerous because misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.385" offset="347164">Nonetheless, despite the poor condition of the law libraries, inmates and other institutions have a misimpression that they were first class library and with that, the director has request to transfers to San Clinton and Folsom in order to utilize the library facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.122" offset="418112">The new rules attempted to solve those problems by standardizing the libraries at all 14 institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.660" offset="448310">This was to be done by providing a carefully selective list of what they call basic codes and references.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.872" offset="633152">This carefully selected list of law books contained the various Codes of the State of California designing team in census, the State and Federal Constitution, a Law Dictionary, Rules of this Court, the California Courts, and Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit, inadvertently omitted and regrettably so all the rules by Federal District Courts in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.827" offset="724999">And also in the list where in The Standard Work on California Criminal procedure, Mr. Watkins(ph) worked on that title and the subscription to the weekly law digest, the California publication which summarizes the most recent decisions of this Court and the California Courts and all areas including criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.305" offset="826876">The response were totaling this complaint on October 27, 1966 by the plaintiffs, a group of inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.191" offset="862403">They challenged the constitutionality of the regulation because it provided, as necessary part of the standardization plan that law books, existing law books at the two institutions, San Clinton and Folsom would have to be removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.420" offset="939307">A counsel was ultimately appointed, the very able gentlemen on my right.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.106" offset="962086">Thereafter, I think at all times through counsel, the inmates filed an amended complaint alleging new causes of action not related to the infinite deal and the filing motion to a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.859" offset="1013077">This motion was denied but then it was able to persuade the single judge to certify the question as of propriety of the three-judge court to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and an interlocutory appeal along that issue was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.902" offset="1081309">The Court of Appeals held it was the case of a three-judge court and it reversed the order of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.699" offset="1108476">We disagreed and filed a certiorari petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.737" offset="1120597">Now, during this premise as early as they could it was not a three-judge court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.175" offset="1138361">Our position is requested and filed and certiorari was unanimously denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.610" offset="1164065">The case went back to the District Court where a three-judge court was convened.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.462" offset="1179530">The Court met on August 6, 1969, requested that the party isolate the issue suitable for a three-judge court determination and certify them clearly and aid the court as much as possible in the existing issues to those of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.763" offset="1256747">We complied by filing lengthy speculation and several statement of issues which we listed five issues, and the first two of which we consider relevant to the appeal and that was the constitutionality under first the Due Process Clause and second to Equal Protection Clause of this regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.479" offset="1339608">We stipulated and suggested relief which included, should the Court find the regulation unconstitutional or the declaration has been constitutionality and then the injunction against this enforcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1100.254" offset="4474720">The District Court relied on it, but the basic course of its position was that the restricted nature of the law book was denied inmates' access to the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.633" offset="4520173">We think that it is not declared totally speak equal protection in this context because if inmate or by their indigency disadvantaged so greatly that they are denied in fact of this access of the Court and of course equal protection would be denied in any other circumstances because the mere fact that they are not as well of as a rich man does not add much to the discussion that equal protection, including a major issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1187.266" offset="4822775">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.722" offset="4832597">This case is about tools which are necessary for access to the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.256" offset="4854645">In the English speaking world the common law entries for history of development of tools which are necessary for access to Courts has been a history wherein the executive has resisted the extension and the granting of these tools, starting with the great struggle to achieve the great writ of freedom, the writ of habeas corpus highlighted by the English statute in 1695 wherein treason defendants were allowed to have counsel at the trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.539" offset="4995810">Before 1695, neither treason nor felony defendants of course could have counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.118" offset="5022142">Then highlighted by our own Sixth Amendment because at that time in England even felony defendants could not have counsel, they did not get the right to counsel until 1836.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.769" offset="5068744">Finally highlighted by our great line, your great line of equal protection cases rendering rights to transcripts and counsel beginning perhaps in 1956 with Griffin versus Illinois through Andrews versus California, so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.654" offset="5140320">As I have mentioned the executive has historically resisted the making available tools for access to the Courts and we believe that executive branch of the California government again does so here and does so strongly and does so quite ably through my brother Nock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.253" offset="5218687">We concur with the Attorney General of California that this is a proper case to be heard by a three-judge court and the three-judge court was properly convened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.085" offset="5262050">We think the strong interest of the California government even resisting the order of granting relief which came from that three-judge court shows that this is the kind of case that Congress had in mind in passing Section 2281 of Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.262" offset="5362674">This regulation which was promulgated pursuant to authority granted by the California Penal Code, by the California Director of Corrections, involves the legislative policy of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.570" offset="5427980">Section 5058 of the California Penal Code allows the Director of Corrections to provide regulations, to establish regulations for the government of the California Prisons and the change from at his pleasure and he has done so here as counsel pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.145" offset="5506243">In September of 1966, five years ago, he promulgated a regulation limiting law books in prison libraries to 12 named law books with which you are familiar from counsel’s argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.124" offset="5578132">He also incidentally in the same transmittal letter in which he promulgated that regulation, promulgated an additional regulation ordering all law books in inmates' personal possession removed and destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.967" offset="5653574">Since that time the California legislature has enacted California Penal Code, Section 2600 which allows inmates to receive and own law books in their own cells.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.139" offset="5714178">But the restriction and this is the whole aspect of this regulation which is really onerous, the restriction of prison libraries to 12 named law books we contend violates the rights of indigent inmates and only indigent inmates to access to the Courts, it is an integral aspect of due process of law and their rights to equal protection of the laws.</text>
