            <label>Mr. Devereux Milburn</label>
            <text syncTime="73.140" offset="366225">The question which this appeal presents to the Court is whether or not this Court should recognize a right to contribution in maritime noncollision cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.598" offset="440099">An obstacle to granting such a right is Halcyon Lines against Haenn, a famous case.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.967" offset="477611">A subsidiary question is whether contribution by the Erie Railroad is precluded by the Longshoremen &amp; Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.245" offset="534662">An alternative is should the Court of Appeals have applied a New Jersey statue, creating a right of contribution by supplementation.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.663" offset="592341">The factual setting in which these questions ought to be decided is relatively simple and can be briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.950" offset="637480">An action was commenced in May of 1966 against Atlantic by a plaintiff Benazet for injuries he sustained on July 30, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.543" offset="699861">For those injuries, Erie Railroad paid him compensation under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.630" offset="728178">The jurisdiction of the District Court rested on diversity of the citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.225" offset="766630">A box car belonging to Atlantic, but on Erie's tracks and having been in Erie's possession for three days, rolled down the Erie's tracks, across a floating bridge and on to a car float which was floating.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.171" offset="850431">Benazet climbed of the back of the box car to adjust the brakes and while turning the wheel, the brake wheel, the foot board gave away, thus throwing his weight backwards against the wheel and the supports of the wheel gave way and Benazet fell to the deck and suffered serious injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.477" offset="959622">This occurred after the Atlantic box car had been through many railroads as stated in the brief for Erie Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.275" offset="1018764">Erie, although it had a duty to inspect upon receiving the car, did not detect the decay of the foot board or the fissure in the supports of the wheel which could be detected from the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.709" offset="1104550">The case was -- as was set aside, the case was tried on the grounds that it was a common law tort and a maritime law was not thought off until after the summation by both counsel and just prior to the charge, when a memorandum was submitted that this thing, that the box car was on it was float and not attached to the pier and not attached to the land except by the floating bridge and therefore maritime law applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.874" offset="1241222">Counsel were given from 5 'o clock that evening until 9 'o clock next morning to readjust their thinking and suddenly become experts in maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.890" offset="1289288">The District Judge gave a questionnaire to the jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.894" offset="1317291">The jurors found that Atlantic was negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.377" offset="1335263">The jurors found that Erie was negligent and the jurors further found that Erie’s negligence was a substantial factor contributing to the injuries of Benazet.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.306" offset="1406943">The Judge, judge Cooper dismissed Atlantic's third party claim against Erie on the ground that in maritime law, no right of contribution existed and refused supplementation by using the New Jersey Joint Tortfeasor's Contribution Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.619" offset="1496178">The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed while finding that our arguments were appealing, nevertheless stating that they propound by the Halcyon decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.286" offset="1562842">Certiorari was granted by this court on October 26, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.862" offset="1597115">The first problem that we are faced with, obviously is Halcyon against Haenn.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.273" offset="1622819">That decision decided that a right to contribution had never been extended in maritime noncollision cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.144" offset="1666287">This was true even though such a right existed in collision cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.774" offset="1688752">Furthermore, the court held that this was a subject for Congress rather than for judicial decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="494.613" offset="2052168">Well, I think the only way it affects it, is that it establishes, (a) unfortunately the negligence of Atlantic and (b) the negligence of Erie and the fact that Erie was, it's negligence was a substantial factor in contributing to the injuries of Benazet.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.567" offset="2123952">Well, I think that, that is important when we get into the active passive arguments which have been used so often in indemnity and in other cases such as this.</text>

            <text syncTime="772.258" offset="3162790">Now, if I could spend a very few seconds on lack of congressional activity, we didn't have it, there isn't any.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.280" offset="3202809">Two decades have passed since the Halcyon decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.435" offset="3223498">There have been bills in Congress which are in the briefs which indicate that in a periphery sort of a way, this was considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.226" offset="3262578">It was put in Bills but it was never reported and never amounted to anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.271" offset="3278774">This is understandable probably because of the decision in the Ryan case which followed the Halcyon case by some two years and in the Ryan case which I am sure Your Honors are familiar with, an indemnity was found by an implied warranty on the part of the stevedore and the shipowner recovered from the stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.473" offset="3379606">This relieved the shipowner in most cases of his absolute liability and his failure to be able to contribute -- to obtain contribution from the stevedore company.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.388" offset="3439270">Now I think, that though there are -- that the Ryan case explains that I think, in our brief you will find a footnote which indicates that far from coming in to argue about Halcyon, they came in to say that the whole unseaworthiness theory was wrong and a Bill should be introduced to eliminate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.751" offset="3524742">But, we do not have any congressional action in the last two decades which would change the result of Halcyon.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.948" offset="3553477">I think our answer to that is contained completely in our quote from Maragni (ph) which appears in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.870" offset="3585138">I think, that in the interest now of symmetry and the Maritime Law, it is time for this Court to create such a right, to recognize a right of contribution in cases similar to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.429" offset="3655459">Now if I might spend just a second on the history of Halcyon and that line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.839" offset="3689105">It started, because I am sure you know with the (Inaudible) case and then through Sieracki to Halcyon and from Halcyon to Pope &amp; Talbot.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.648" offset="3732259">A great deal was made of the Sieracki case, I would like to just point out one difference between that case and our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.546" offset="3775936">There was a great deal of language there and there is a great deal of language in all these cases on this point about the absolute liability of the shipowner and the non-delegable character of that liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.412" offset="3827345">Many cases go off on that line that we cannot let him pass on any part of his liability because if he does so, he will not have a safe ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.857" offset="3869141">He will not have the incentive to have a safer ship.Well, the difference is that we are not the ship owner, Erie is the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.700" offset="3904458">We don't have that, we don't have liability without fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.451" offset="3919505">Erie is the one that has that and I think that that to some extent distinguishes Sieracki and Pope &amp; Talbot, and to some extent Halcyon.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.277" offset="3974780">Now, when they get to -- through Halcyon and Pope &amp; Talbot, the law suddenly takes a bend to the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.357" offset="4015113">The shipping industry, the Maritime law finds the Halcyon case hard to stomach and instead of that it develops the Ryan Theory and the Ryan Theory came two years later, decided by Mr. Justice Burton who had dissented in Halcyon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.148" offset="4082300">The Ryan case, developed a theory of Indemnity and said that the Stevedore had an implied warranty, had given an implied warranty for workmen like service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.999" offset="4137680">In some cases, there was a written warranty of working rights service, but in the Ryan case, it was an implied warranty of workmen like service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.402" offset="4183342">From Ryan, we went to Weyerhaeuser against McQuinn (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.887" offset="4205285">There, the indemnity held even though it was equipment that was used negligibly by the Stevedore and had said in that case, this Court said in that case, that not even the negligence of shipowner would defeat this claim of indemnity against the Stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.213" offset="4290548">That was the case that also said that the active, passive concept of negligence was not important and it was in opposite in cases such as that we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.690" offset="4336419">After that, we have the Fisser case, the Crumady against Fisser, where even their equipment that was thoroughly in use, in a faulty manner by the Stevedore was supplied by the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.411" offset="4395351">Then in Boudoin, we have the warranty not only running to the shipowner but it went to the consignee of the cargo, and finally in Ataya (ph), we reached the conclusion that the Stevedore was liable for indemnity even though he had not been negligent himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.955" offset="4493572">The next case which came along and which really is where we are at present moment was the Federal Maritime against Isbrandtsen, which suddenly showed the opposite side of the coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.309" offset="4558982">This case suddenly said, that the shipowner might owe some duties itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.963" offset="4585523">They did owe a duty to the Stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.705" offset="4608511">In that case, where they said, all the duty to the Stevedore and it's last sentence said that it did not judge at that time, between the liability of the Stevedore for indemnity and the negligence of the shipowner for violation of his duty to the Stevedore and it left it at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.886" offset="4725226">Now the Isbrandtsen case pointed out that there was no quid pro quo running between these two people, the Stevedore and the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.705" offset="4776530">There is a quid pro quo running between the stevedore and his employee and that is contained in the Longshoremen's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.861" offset="4805160">He gave up and he accepted the Stevedore absolute liability and in return for that, he gave, he received a limitation of his damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.175" offset="4858450">Now, that Isbrandtsen leads us to looking for a possible solution, I might just add one other line of cases running out of Halcyon which is the Fifth Circuit, the Horton and now the Second Circuit with its latest Moragne case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.607" offset="4956148">All those cases interpret Halcyon as being limited towards facts, as holding that there is only -- no right to contribution when one of the parties is barred -- his limitations, his liabilities is limited is limited by Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.947" offset="5037546">Now we have maintained and said throughout in our brief that the liability of Erie in this case is not limited by statute or is not exclusively set by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.974" offset="5105569">As I stated before Benazet has right to sue Erie for unseaworthiness and if he did sue on this -- based on the Yaka and the Jackson against Lykes cases, if he did sue Erie and was successful, it could recover in addition to its payments under the Longshoremen's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.729" offset="5204625">We therefore could extend the Cotton and Watz and Moragne case in such a way is to avoid Halcyon and say that Halcyon is limited to its facts and here the liability is not limited and only under the act, but there was also the unseaworthiness liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.363" offset="5315175">On the other hand by so doing, we will avoid the frontal attack on Halcyon which we feel is so necessary at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.372" offset="5367211">Now as was stated in the Ataya case, contribution is based on law and indemnity is based on a contract theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.325" offset="5419038">Both are unjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.686" offset="5428442">I don't say contribution is unjust but the denial of the right of contribution and indemnity are unjust in that both put 100% of the liability on one side or on the other, unless of course the indemnity is set by a written contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.789" offset="5504824">Now, that brings me to a interesting case which is annexed to applied brief as an appendix, Dole against Dow Chemical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.598" offset="5560099">That case was decided by the New York Court of Appeals within the last week or so, came out with in the last week or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.400" offset="5595312">In that case the manufacturer manufactured an insecticide or a powder of aerosol of one kind or another and the user sprayed the room and shortly that after his employee walked in and died because of the effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.237" offset="5670649">The user claimed that, there wasn't on the can how it should be used, the manufacturer said it was on the can, you didn't use it rightly, you should have aired the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.316" offset="5714953">Judge Began (ph) in that case threw aside all considerations of active and passive negligence and that case was a natural for active and passive negligence in an indemnity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.763" offset="5776707">But he threw that aside and he decided that he was going to fashion a new remedy and that remedy was going to be decided upon where did the fault lie and if the fault was evenly divided or unevenly divided in either case, he was going to decide where the fault lay and at what percentage and at what proportion and in that way distribute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.561" offset="5883913">Now, he talks in the language of indemnity, but he comes out with a result of the contribution and quite frequently during his opinion, he certainly stops talking about indemnity and talks about contribution, but it is the result that we are particularly interested in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.660" offset="5956325">It is the discarding of the active-passive theory and the idea of sitting down and looking at this problem, if negligence was against -- now you ought to pay in proportion of how you -- in proportion which you are negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.509" offset="6015779">And we recommend the consideration of that decision as a solution, as a cutting of this knot between indemnity a 100%, and denial of contribution a 100% and let the damages for wherever this Court will decide within the next few weeks, either equally divide it if it is a maritime or in some other way depending on (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.894" offset="6141271">Now, one thing about the Dole case that I would emphasis is, at the end, he ends up with a tort solution and this is a tort case and his was a tort case and you ought to have a tort decision dividing the remedies equally or unequally in accordance with Fall but you should not -- these cases should not really be decided on the basis of contract and implied warranties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.925" offset="6273451">Now, the next problem that arises is the Longshore and Harbor Workers Act and its language which might to some at first blush indicate that it was exclusive -- that it was the exclusive liability of the Erie Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.099" offset="6362058">I would say, that there are three reasons why -- not reasons but three reasons why this was not necessarily true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.163" offset="6406362">It was decided in the Ryan case that the act did not -- was not exclusive and in Weyerhaeuser against United States case, it was decided that it was said our act, The Longshore act is virtually identical with the Workmen's Compensation Act, the Federal Employees' Compensation Act which is under consideration there, and that didn't bar what we are asking for and thirdly, there is no principle of court that we are saying as they said in the New York case and as was indicated in Isbrandtsen that we have a separable, legal entity of rights here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.209" offset="6546587">We have got Atlantic against Erie, Erie against Atlantic, all Mr. Benazet does really in this case is to measure the damages which are to be apportioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1647.580" offset="6664034">I am Barrett Prettyman and I represent the respondent the Erie Lackawanna Railway in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.562" offset="6687962">I think there is something superficially appealing about the proposition advanced by petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.738" offset="6712622">We have two people at fault plus petitioner, make them divide the damages which are due to injured party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.505" offset="6743760">Well, it's not so simple and I think once we will get into it, I will show that it's not so appealing either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.627" offset="6768210">Let's look first to see how the rule would operate within the specific facts of this case and then let's see how they would operate generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.658" offset="6804364">There were two serious defects in this railroad car which was owned by Atlantic and both of these defects were at least two years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.925" offset="6849399">During those two years, this boxcar had been in the possession of 49 different railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.158" offset="6878342">It had been in the possession of 7 railroads as often or more often than it had been in the Erie's possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.155" offset="6914287">It had been in Atlantic's own possession eight times, twice as many as it had been in Erie's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.766" offset="6944798">More importantly, it had been in Atlantic's repair shop for other repairs, at least four times during this period and there were three additional inspection reports by Atlantic, one of them within seven weeks of this accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.668" offset="7028390">It had never been in Erie's repair shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.130" offset="7042182">Now, the test -- the relevance of that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.456" offset="7051482">The testimony shows that the owning railroad has a very special duty in regard to its own cars.</text>

            <text syncTime="1757.237" offset="7102682">The only railroad when it has its car, now this is not just in the repair shop, but when it gets hold of its own car, it looks for cardable (ph) damage, damage which was done by others and should have been repaired by others, it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.062" offset="7145941">It looks for excessive wear and tries to anticipate excessive wear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.552" offset="7163913">It looks also at empty cars and this is important because in this case for example, the car was full.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.442" offset="7187423">We couldn't have looked inside and while the particular defect happened to be outside, it indicates the only railroad has more of a chance to review the damage to a car and moreover, once the car goes into the repair shop, it gets a complete inspection supposedly from top to bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.199" offset="7266522">Thus while the normal inspection of a braking system which is done by a car into its possession, the car happens to fall, is a two minute examination, normally walking around the car and inspecting things on sight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.692" offset="7328485">The owning car has a special duty to look at its own cars and particularly when it's in his own repair shop and remember this car was in Atlantic's own repair shop four times during this two-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.658" offset="7384387">It was pure happenstance, that this accident happened while the car happened to be in Erie's possession, rather than somebody else's, one of these 48 other railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.537" offset="7427854">There was nothing wrong with the car float or a car barge which was what Erie, Erie owned here, nothing wrong with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.087" offset="7458052">There is no evidence that Mr. Benezet, who was Erie's employee was negligent, or contributorily negligent, in fact, the jury said no he wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.183" offset="7490444">There was no evidence that any other Erie employee was in anyway negligent either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.953" offset="7509565">This accident could as easily have happened on any other person's properties as Erie's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.636" offset="7540285">Following the accident and here is rather unique point going to your point Mr. Justice White, following the accident, Erie promptly paid Mr. Benazet over $11,000 under The Longshoremen &amp; Harbor Workers' Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.254" offset="7594725">And I think one of the interesting facts here is that you have a man, who was paid under the Longshoremen's Act, treated as a Longshoremen and yet if he is a ship owner, why isn't he a crewman and if I may very respectfully suggest that this is one of a number of reasons why, my own view is that this is quite an inappropriate case to decide this far-reaching question of Maritime law because you do have this confusion between things like the Safety Appliance Act and the Longshoremen's Act and so forth, in this particular rather peculiar incident where you have railroad car sitting on a car bridge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1945.309" offset="7854904">Now I want to emphasize that in paying under the Longshoremen's Act, Erie had no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.359" offset="7883116">This was an absolute duty and without relation before, no normal defenses applied, such as the fellow-servant or assumption or as a contributory negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1988.234" offset="8026685">Now, to turn to the law, there was no contribution as you know, in common law and then the courts fashioned an exception in collision cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.063" offset="8065974">What Halcyon did really, was to extend, was to refuse to extend this particular exception to noncollision cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.423" offset="8095440">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.719" offset="8100560">Well I think it did so for a very good reason. Congress had repeatedly legislated in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.973" offset="8125637">Harbor Workers' Act, Harbor Act, Jones Act, Public Vessels Act, Death on the High Seas Act, Extension of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act, Limited Liability Act and yet it had repeatedly refused to provide for contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.217" offset="8186555">If there really was a need for contribution, said this Court in Halcyon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.676" offset="8204422">Let Congress provide for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.880" offset="8213200">Congress is better suited to say, not only whether contribution ought to be provided, but also if so, what measure of contribution should be provided, that is equally divided, proportionate or as the Court of Appeals said in Halcyon, limited by the amount of compensation, which the employer would have paid, if in that case, he had paid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.529" offset="8303792">The Court pointed out that there are awful lot of people interested in these admiralty matters and they could present their diversion views to Congress and these views could be reconciled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.161" offset="8342349">Now that was 20 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.771" offset="8352798">Congress has refused to change the Halcyon Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.940" offset="8365441">Where are all those people who were so quick to find Maritime abusive, the insurance companies, Maritime administration, Interior, Treasury, Justice, Commerce Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.331" offset="8407028">Insurance companies as I said, Shipping and Stevedoring companies union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.253" offset="8426672">They have not come forward to complain about the Halcyon Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.612" offset="8448197">It is true, as we stress that Congress has introduced Bills which we think would have the effect of changing Halcyon, but the interesting thing about it is that the reports on those Bills not only indicate that Congress didn't have in mind changing Halcyon, but more importantly, none of those Bills have even gone out of committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.369" offset="8523221">Congress is satisfied with the Halcyon rule as established by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.126" offset="8542238">Now as a matter of fact, I was informed several days ago that on May 2, S525, which was introduced on behalf of the administration will have hearings in the Congress and with the Chief Justice's permission, I would like to submit copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.127" offset="8614231">Mr. Chief Justice, if I may, of that Bill to the clerk, copies, I have given copies today to my opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.221" offset="8646623">That bill would make a compensation the exclusive remedy by anyone against any employer and this even would include indemnity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.722" offset="8688628">Secretary of Labor as I understand would testify first on May 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.304" offset="8702943">So this is hardly a dead issue in Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.746" offset="8712661">This issue, which this Court said in Halcyon was peculiarly one for the Congress, is actively under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.539" offset="8747874">I would next like to point out that even if Halcyon were restrictive in some way, there would be no contribution here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.695" offset="8776504">In Halcyon no compensation was paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.715" offset="8796566">The injured worker sued the shipowner, which impleaded the employer and the Court of Appeals held that the employer was liable in contribution only for the amount it would have paid in compensation, if the employee had elected to sue for compensation, but in this case, Erie has already paid compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.222" offset="8878591">So even if the Halcyon rule is restricted back to the view of the Court of Appeals in that case, Erie still owes nothing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.383" offset="8911191">Secondly, in Halcyon, the employer was the real party at fault, not the shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.093" offset="8934075">The jury found in that case that the employer was 75% negligent and here of course the situation is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.293" offset="8966885">So if the court adopted a rule of contribution, which was designed to make sure that the chief wrongdoer will not be immune from all liability, which really happened in Halcyon, that purpose would not be served by contribution in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.058" offset="9037938">But in any event we claim that Halcyon shouldn’t be cut back, much less to overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.327" offset="9059045">Barring contribution is entirely consistent with established law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.878" offset="9081196">Unlike indemnity, contribution is based on joint liability as joint tortfeasors to a common injured party resulting from a single tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.753" offset="9136680">This Court has made that distinction many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.481" offset="9147652">There is no such joint liability here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.070" offset="9157996">Erie’s obligation without regard to fault to this injured party was to paying compensation under the Act, which it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.896" offset="9189239">Mr. Benazet, the injured employee could not have sued Erie for negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.727" offset="9208569">With all due respect, Mr. Justice Stewart indicated a minute ago, that the court had established that anyone could sue for negligence, that is accurate with a single exception [Attempt to Laughter].</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.610" offset="9260187">Here the Longshoremen cannot sue his employer for negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.485" offset="9283698">The furtherest the Court is gone in the Yaka and Lykes brothers case is to say that he can sue for unseaworthiness if the employer is also the owner of the vessel and the employer is solely responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.201" offset="9346496">But there is a large difference between suing for unseaworthiness and a suing for negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.871" offset="9369170">On negligence, we are absolutely protected by the specific words of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.586" offset="9392054">The Act could hardly be clear in regard to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.184" offset="9406473">Therefore, contribution is totally inapplicable here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2400.280" offset="9674803">[Attempt to Laughter] Now the same argument, precisely the same argument that Atlantic is making here in terms of the equities, that was made by the shipowner in Pope &amp; Talbot v. Hawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.007" offset="9717748">I would like you to refer very specifically to that case because in that case here’s what the shipowner argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.291" offset="9746901">He said to allow the employee to get full recovery and then to pay over to his employer, what he had received in contribute -- in that compensation, would reward the employer who had also been negligent, that was precisely the argument that he made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.579" offset="9816073">This Court said no, the Act intends that employers who are absolutely liable to employees for compensation being protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.694" offset="9852436">Therefore if the Court overrules Halcyon, it's also going to have to rule this portion of Hawn as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.052" offset="9885872">Moreover, it’s simply not fair to impose contribution in this case for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.563" offset="9907920">Here, Erie and Atlanta of course happen both to be parties, but in another cases, where the employer recovers against the third-party, that third-party can turn around and sue the employer later for contribution, doesn’t have to be on the same suit and when it does, the employer is not allowed many of the normal defenses, including statute limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.588" offset="10008021">The burden in these cases, we submit, should fall on the responsible party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.045" offset="10029859">There’s no question here as judge Cooper found that there was no intervening cause between the negligence of this boxcar’s owner and the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.423" offset="10079387">More importantly, the burden and this is something that's been developed in your recent cases, the burden should fall on the party best able to prevent the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.102" offset="10122124">This theme runs through so many of your recent opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.899" offset="10133304">Isn’t that what we’re really trying to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.469" offset="10143544">We're going to talk about the acts of equity, trying to prevent the accident itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.217" offset="10166532">If Atlantic can get contribution from Erie, when Erie's only fault, only fault was a failure to inspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.453" offset="10199551">That's what the pleading even said on behalf of Atlantic, that’s all we were ever charged with, was a failure to inspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.764" offset="10224733">I see no reason why we couldn’t bring in the other railroads as well, rather Atlantic could bring in the other railroad as well, who had had this car in their possession and further dilute its responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.754" offset="10272694">But even if it splits only with us, the net effect is to give comfort to this one party best able to cure the defects in this boxcar and that's its owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.544" offset="10319923">If you gave contribution in this case, you would be saying that Atlantic doesn’t owe a $100,000 of this judgment, even though for two years it allowed its own boxcar to stay in this condition and even though it had this boxcar in its possession 8 times in its own shop, four times, and never could detected this condition in its own boxcars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.166" offset="10434339">Now I would like to point out to you in the light of the rather simplistic argument that you should simply allow contribution to some of the difficulties and a few other things that you will have to face if you say that it is applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.547" offset="10495884">First, if you decide that contribution is not absolutely barred as a kind of general proposition, then you’re going to have to face the question that would not have to be decided in Halcyon and that is does the Harbor Workers' Act bar contribution where the employer has paid compensation?</text>
