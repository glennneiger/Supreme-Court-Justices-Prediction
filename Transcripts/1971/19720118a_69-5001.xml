            <text syncTime="30.580" offset="195981">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.916" offset="225343">In the prosecution for murder, the state concealed six items of exonerating evidence and used a weapon that was not connected with the petitioner Moore or the offense, that announced him as a bad man generally and the jury that had been selected in violation of Witherspoon standards found petitioner guilty and fixed his punishment of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.508" offset="367658">This case begins at 10 PM on Wednesday, April 25, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.046" offset="405901">A bartender in Lansing, Illinois ejected a profane customer on this tavern.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.591" offset="435994">At 10:55 PM that customer rushed back in with a twelve gauge shot gun and shot him in the heart and killed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.156" offset="482283">Two days later in the nearby Tavern a man known only by the nickname Slick bragged that he had shot the bartender in Lansing.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.848" offset="545081">Trial was held 25 months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.891" offset="565248">Two state witnesses identified petitioner Moore as the assailant.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.684" offset="596386">Two of his employers testified that he was at work 50 miles North of Lansing, Illinois in Wilmette Country Club until after midnight.</text>

            <text syncTime="156.206" offset="698472">I would say it about the 27 to 30 miles and a little bit East.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.768" offset="728775">This is far southeast you should not get to (Inaudible) and Wilmette is way North and this was before we had that Dan Ryan Expressway opened up.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.415" offset="775377">You could not have got there 50 miles except by going through small side streets of that, but nothing open, of course the auto drive is open.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.461" offset="823547">Now, opposing those two people that said that he was the assailant, that these employers and verified by the work records, he was paid overtime, worked till after midnight that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.209" offset="906512">The most damaging evidence against this man Moore on the testimony of state witness Virgle Sanders.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.429" offset="939426">Virgle Sanders identified the petitioner Moore as a man that he knew, a man that he had seen several times before, but knew only by the nickname Slick.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.979" offset="1001597">He testified that on Friday afternoon, 1:30 PM, that is less than 40 hours after this killing, this man Slick was in the Tavern, Ponderosa Tavern and said to him “Hey, Virgle, it's Open Season on bartenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.258" offset="1082681">I shot one in the Lansing on last Wednesday night.”</text>
            <text syncTime="259.902" offset="1113297">Now five of the concealed items of exonerating evidence involved Virgle Sanders.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.495" offset="1147674">They were uncovered in the post conviction hearing that took place on January 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.821" offset="1192918">Friday night, I mean Friday afternoon, April 27th at 1:30 PM that is the bragging incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.913" offset="1221339">Really the voluntary confession of this man Slick that he killed the bartender.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.150" offset="1246312">Next day, Saturday, a Lansing police are in that Ponderosa tap in their clock in to a man named William, Leon Thomson.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.309" offset="1274943">“Did you hear about it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="301.656" offset="1280272">“Oh, yes he heard about it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="305.382" offset="1295214">“Can you identify Slick?”</text>
            <text syncTime="306.463" offset="1299498">“Yes, I can.”</text>
            <text syncTime="311.861" offset="1321127">Monday, April 30, 1962 8:50 PM, Sanders is in the police station of Lansing and he is giving the statement and tells the police that he first met Slick about six months ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.466" offset="1387583">Now, that would make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.889" offset="1397196">November 1, 1961 in Wanda and Del’s tavern.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.072" offset="1421960">Of course the police would not know the significance of that after six months later but that statement is one of the things that was withheld from the trial lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.138" offset="1470234">Immediately, after getting his statement the Lansing police get their shotguns and automatic weapon and they go and they raid Wanda and Del’s tavern looking for the man called Slick and he was not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.242" offset="1518613">They talked to the owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.119" offset="1522166">His name is Delbert Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.325" offset="1530943">“Do you know him?”</text>
            <text syncTime="367.510" offset="1543690">“Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="366.290" offset="1543586">“Can you identify him?”</text>
            <text syncTime="370.557" offset="1555916">And that is the second thing that these trial lawyers do nothing about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.763" offset="1636686">This is only a man known by nickname Slick and that is all.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.109" offset="1654136">Now the Lansing police after this raid, let us make at May 1, they have an immediate suspect James E. Watts, James E. "Slick" Watts.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.531" offset="1707844">Nobody knows about that until right near to the end of the post conviction hearing when the state brings it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.233" offset="1742639">And that's January 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.603" offset="1756118">So that is the third thing that was withheld from this trial matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.769" offset="1780778">They did not know that they had an immediate suspect named James E. “Slick” Watts.</text>

            <text syncTime="435.287" offset="1814841">That comes right from the Chief of Police.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.383" offset="1823201">The Chief of Police testified that he assigned Lieutenant Turbin to look for James E. “Slick” Watts.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.467" offset="1855592">Now, where he looked for him, I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.722" offset="1868549">But they have never found him.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.203" offset="1874505">Not even to this day as I stand before you now in 1971 or 1972 Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.363" offset="1915152">That is the third thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.695" offset="1920481">Now on May 1, 1962, the Lansing police, let's just recapitulate little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.218" offset="1942528">They know three people who all know each other and who all know a man named Slick and that's Virgle Sanders, William Leon Thompson and Delbert Jones, the owner of Wanda and Del’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.809" offset="1996863">Six months later, petitioner Moore is arrested and the Lansing police photographed him, take the photograph over to William Leon Thompson's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.926" offset="2057362">That ain't Slick.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.678" offset="2064363">It does not resemble him.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.432" offset="2075439">Tells that to Lieutenant Turbin Sergeant Bandernerd (ph) and they do not tell that to anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.650" offset="2104278">Excuse me, they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.285" offset="2110861">They tell it to the prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.622" offset="2120161">They don't tell it to the defense lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.369" offset="2135103">And right after they took petitioner Moore in to custody they get a report and a kick back sheet from the FBI which shows that petitioner Moore was in a federal penitentiary from February 18, 1957 to March 4, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.241" offset="2222665">Now, you put that together with the statement that he originally gave and what do you find out that it is impossible for him to be the man known as Slick that Sanders first met in Wanda and Del’s owner about November 1, 1961.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas J. Immel</label>
            <text syncTime="1762.586" offset="7124072">Mr. Chief Justice, and members of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.481" offset="7147583">I would like to say as a prosecutor from the state of Illinois that as the evidence in this case remotely resembled the characterization which has been described to, and my colleague and friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.007" offset="7205679">I would not have the courage to stand before this court this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.475" offset="7231592">Counsel has been involved in this case for considerable length of time and my fair judgment as a attorney he is more than a legend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.002" offset="7261686">And for that reason I am going to take the liberty of restating the facts as I truly think they are reflected in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.423" offset="7291361">And I only turn the court to April 25, 1962 when a gentleman who I contend was Lyman Moore and a companion who was a dark haired man wearing a mustache went into a Tavern in Lansing and where the petitioner Lyman Moore was subsequently objected for profane language who returned approximately one hour later and at time later shot gun across the bar and terminated Mr. Bernard Zitek.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.952" offset="7409434">Now, not mentioned this morning at all is the fact that two people, one the cocktail waitress Patricia Hill from a distance of six feet observed this whole incident twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.477" offset="7459589">She observed the ejection, she observed the subsequent shooting an hour later and she said at trial the Lyman Moore was the gun man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.989" offset="7505669">Lyman Moore was the man who ejected an hour earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.683" offset="7524373">Another patron of the Tavern, a man by the name of Henley Powell was present in the Tavern at the time that the shooting took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.479" offset="7563557">He is not able to tell us whether Moore was the man ejected from the Tavern, he may not even have been there at that time but Henley Powell was playing pinochle with a few other gentlemen around the table and his testimony is pertinent in another point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.904" offset="7625310">Playing pinochle, severed the fate of many pinochle players he cannot beat, so he lays his hand down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.882" offset="7649238">He is sitting out of the the hand and he looks toward the door and what does he observe that Lyman Moore, who he identifies at the trial, come through the door carrying a shotgun, walk up to the bar and killed the bartender Mr. Zitek.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.881" offset="7701170">Henley Powell pursued Lyman Moore out of the Tavern and was confronted with him in a well lighted street where upon Lyman Moore told Henley Powell according to Mr. Henley Powell “get back or I kill you too.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.321" offset="7754982">Now, these two people were not discussed this morning but this was the state's case and chief, this was the eyewitness to the killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.890" offset="7797196">Now, two days later in another Tavern call the Ponderosa Tavern no way related to the Tavern where the killing takes place, Vigle Sanders is having a beer with the gentlemen who he at the time is identifying as Slick and at trial says he knew as Slick and this gentleman says to him, “It is open season on bartenders, I shot one over in Lansing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.829" offset="7912970">Now, totally unmentioned in any the petitioner's brief and not mentioned here this morning is, there were a couple of other people there when that conversation took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.257" offset="7954662">One of whom was the bartender, skinhead Joyce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.172" offset="7978381">Now, skinhead is standing behind the bar and Vigle Sanders approaches him and said, “This gentleman would like to have a ride over to Harvey, can we arrange that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.193" offset="8022476">And Mr. Skinhead Moore, Joyce rather testifies at trial that, “Yes, he arranged for the ride that Lyman Moore was the man in the bar conversing with Virgle Sanders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.117" offset="8082139">Now, they need to get a ride from Mr. Moore who they contacted, they contacted the owner of Ponderosa who is also in the Tavern at the time and he says, “Can you arrange for a lift for this fellow here?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.802" offset="8128846">And his companion who again by the way is the dark haired man wearing a mustache, same description we have of the companion of Moore at the time he is ejected from the Tavern, okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.311" offset="8170956">What happens then?</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.345" offset="8179106">Mr. Fair accommodates these two gentlemen and drives them all the way to Harvey, in the course of which they stopped twice in two different tavern and enjoyed themselves as companions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.565" offset="8235948">Now, Mr. Fair testifies at trial that Lyman Moore is the man that he accommodated and he is the man who is the Ponderosa and he is the man he drove to Harvey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.471" offset="8275550">And that furthermore in the course of their automobile ride and this time his testimony he is referring to them as Moore and Barbee, because they are on the first name basis at this point or second name basis and I knew that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.848" offset="8321108">At this point he says during the course of the automobile ride one of them and it is not clear from the record which said, “If we have to have that trouble with that bartender in Lansing we would be in this spot,” testimony that of Fair, “Well, if we had to have a trouble with the bartender in Lansing we had been alright,” that is what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.246" offset="8398639">Now, Mr. Fair was called to testify at trial and he testified that Lyman Moore was the man that went from him from the Ponderosa, after he request of Joyce, the bartender and he is the man that he drove to Harvey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.367" offset="8455168">Now, that tells me that Virgle Sanders statement that Lyman Moore was in Ponderosa with him has been corroborated and that any misidentification or confusion of identities that Virgle Sanders is subsequently trapped with because of his murky recollections of phantom named Slick was yet to be underground by anybody and the police obviously abandoned once they had three, two eyewitnesses to the killing and three witnesses to the brag.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.160" offset="8582332">It tells me that Vigle Sanders testimony is accurate, insofar as it purports to reflect the conversation that he had with Lyman Moore and that it is inaccurate insofar as he purports to tell us that Lyman Moore and a fellow by name is Slick are same people, they are not, Slick was a -- If Lyman Moore is Slick it is impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.322" offset="8670939">Slick is a fellow that this gentleman Sanders met in Wanda and Del’s back in November sometime I suppose in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.647" offset="8704272">Lyman Moore is in the federal penitentiary that time, a bank robbery charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2489.427" offset="10031397">He is bartender at a suburban country club and he testifies that the pay records indicate the petitioner was paid for working as a cocktail waiter that night and from that he construes that he must have been there, although he cannot testify and it is determined that he cannot, he actually said, Lyman Moore was there, he did not see him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.995" offset="10097643">At cross examination, he is confronted with the fact that he had previously made a statement to the police that he simply had not seen Lyman Moore that night and I think his testimony is taken for what it is worth, this is worth little but in any event Herbert Anderson the manager of the country club is then called to testify and he tell us that their pay records reflected Lyman Moore, who was paid for that evening and that he did not see Lyman Moore that evening because but he sure he must have been there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.549" offset="10211850">So under veracity of the bookkeeping entry which was not admitted in evidence the books and records were not admitted that is the alibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.339" offset="10251034">Now, interesting thing about the alibi that ought to be brought to the attention of the court in as much as it is characterized by the defense is unimpeached and the valuable and characterizing in the dissenting opinion in the Illinois Supreme Court which I certainly have cognizance of, as unimpeached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.863" offset="10321147">The same alibi was introduced at the armed robbery trial which I have just referred to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2835.293" offset="11414841">And he said “yes” one of two things would have happened in this case, either the prosecutor would have pulled the statement out of the file if he had it or he would have turned with a horrible grimace on his face that the police man at the table and said, “Where is the statement?”</text>

            <text syncTime="3085.155" offset="12414286">But I am simply stating to the court at this time that the prosecutor had he known about a written statement certainly would have pursued the matter and certainly at that time would have been unnoticed because by that time he has Lyman Moore grab sheets (ph) from the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.185" offset="12486384">He knows that Lyman Moore was in the penitentiary if he has in his hand a written statement from Lyman Moore that says he met the man six months ago, isn't he certainly got to clear it up before he lets him go on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.393" offset="12531210">It is clear discrepancy, of course the simple answer to it all is that Lyman Moore is not Slick and that he is not the man that Virgle Sanders met in Wanda and Del’s back in November or whenever it was in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.158" offset="12582306">It is a simple mistaken identity situation and to that extent Virgle Sander's testimony is potentially impeachable as to whether or not he can accurately recall who it was that he talked to in the Ponderosa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.498" offset="12655658">And it is material only on the aggravation or penalty phase of this case, if you will because it was a brag that's an issue here, that the brag did not take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.420" offset="12703305">Lyman Moore cannot be nearly as bad a man as you might presume.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.162" offset="12718352">And that is why this would naturally be a relevant question but two other people that completely rehabilitate in the course of this trial, any potential impeachment of Virgle Sander's testimony with reference to who he talked to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.477" offset="12787628">He might have mixed him up with Slick, he might have thought he met him before, and obviously as far I am concerned, I am completely wrong about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.826" offset="12820961">But then he was talking to Lyman Moore is established beyond any doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.515" offset="12839769">Not a reasonable doubt but any doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.692" offset="12848441">And the testimony of the people who identified him they are Fair and Joyce, the people who have spotted him in the Ponderosa, a place in there is not impeached in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.360" offset="12903090">He was referred to as I say by name in the testimony of Mr. Fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.323" offset="12934959">Now, Henley Powell, I would like touch on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.137" offset="12954185">Henley Powell as you recall, the gentleman was playing cards and he witnesses the shooting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.201" offset="12974456">When the police went out there that night and the officer name Koppitz apparently drew a rough diagram of the premises, that is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.651" offset="13012281">He drew a card table and he placed Mr. Powell at the seat and Mr. Powell said he was identified and he was sitting at the time which would have placed him roughly looking toward you Mr. Justice Blackmun, the door being somewhere over toward my back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3248.579" offset="13067975">Now, it is the contention of the petitioner that this diagram which has did not come to light until the post-conviction was heard has a devastating effect on the varsity of Henley Powell as a witness and it shows that he purged it himself when he said, he could see what was going on over by the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.374" offset="13159194">And this to me is an example of attempting to use diminimus to simply defeat due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.704" offset="13184481">Henley Powell's testimony was that even playing pinochle sees in the position like through his handout because he could not bid he was looking towards the door when he saw Lyman Moore come in, but he supposed to purge it himself because he was facing and seated and facing at that direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.950" offset="13233486">Now, this is the kind of critical argument was presented to the highest court in the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="3606.403" offset="14499276">There was an implication in the Anderson opinion from the California Supreme Court that they like inference release of decided that the court by inference has reach this conclusion as this is an improper use of peremptories, my simple statement for the court would be as most unusual way of Rosaline versus Alabama that I could possibly imagine, it could not possible have been in the mind of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.230" offset="14582554">In this case had the eight jurors, who are arguably removed for cause and I think, some of them properly were but in any event, my intention would simply be that under present standards and under present techniques on Witherspoon questioning, most of those people would have gone off anyway because when asked the second question, when you could sign the verdict, it would say “yes, our experience teaches us that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.904" offset="14685268">From all across the country in our conversations with prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.445" offset="14695508">Therefore we still have peremptory challenges to eliminate the rest if that is desire of the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.948" offset="14717450">I do not think the jury tried this man would then compose with any differently I think that the opinion of the late justice Black and his dissenting opinion has proved to be rather prophetic, in a sense that the conversations of the juries in not going to do any different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.945" offset="14781503">If Mr. Justice Blackmun had any further questions on Witherspoon, I think I stand on the brief for the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.098" offset="14802087">Thank your honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3711.736" offset="14920579">Now, Virgle Sanders knew of him, so why bring in the people that did know but one fellow told the police that he sure looked different, that is not in the record because you cannot get all of this from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.547" offset="14963837">And the gun, it is terribly denigrating to the Chicago Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory, a scientist said it comes from 12-gauge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.592" offset="15008037">All you got to do is buy the shooters bible or sport's field or anything to find out the differences a great deal, 330 seconds of an inch between the 12-gauge wadding and the 16-gauge wadding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.254" offset="15062685">And it is not a legal argument, it is an argument based on the immutable laws of the universe, the exact science of measurements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.103" offset="15106048">Mr. Anderson stated at trial that his opinion that if Lyman Moore was missing for any length of time, he would have notice him being missing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.606" offset="15148053">He says that these people have been asked to make the statements, asked to make the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.250" offset="15182639">There was a written motion for all statements given to the Lansing police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.959" offset="15205522">There was a promise by the prosecutors on page 32 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.904" offset="15233317">We will give them to him when the witness is finishing testifying on direct examination your honor and they did with two.</text>
