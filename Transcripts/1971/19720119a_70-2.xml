            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="44.320" offset="250952">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.234" offset="270596">This case comes here on appeal from the Central District Court of California, which held unconstitutional an act of Congress providing for the forfeiture of obscene material imported into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.790" offset="356800">This present case and the one which follows are sequels to the decisions of the Court last term in United States against Reidel and United States against Thirty-Seven Photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.111" offset="426181">Those cases involved transmissions through the mails and importation of obscene materials for commercial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.336" offset="474978">The distinctive feature of this case is that the importation here is alleged to be for private use.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.184" offset="518446">The present proceeding is an in rem proceeding against a number of items which were imported by the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.329" offset="558988">Some of those have been returned to the claimant as not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.890" offset="581244">The others are on file at the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.512" offset="599739">I believe it can be said that if anything is obscene, these items are and particularly the printed material.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.550" offset="643833">These in my view are not borderline materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.239" offset="666612">If the Court is disposed to hold that there is nothing that can be held to be obscene under the Constitution, that will dispose of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.585" offset="712065">But if obscenity still has any constitutional meaning, then I believe that these materials would have to be found to be obscene by any standard which has ever been suggested by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.779" offset="780819">When the complaint for forfeiture came on to be heard, the District Court granted a motion to dismiss, relying on the prior decision of the same court in the Thirty-Seven Photographs case, the one which was reversed last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.623" offset="864202">At that time the claimant filed an affidavit, stating that the items were not, and I quote “were not imported by me for any commercial purpose, but were intended to be used and possessed by me personally.”</text>
            <text syncTime="214.158" offset="930344">And in response to the United States Attorney filed a motion for a stay of the order of dismissal in which he stated that the United States had and again I quote, “No evidence with which to contradict Mr. Paladini’s affidavit and therefore does not confess the fact that this was a private importation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="243.499" offset="1047686">There are at least two lines of reasoning on which the government’s case maybe rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.467" offset="1079556">In the first place, if these materials are obscene as I have contended or if they must be regarded as obscene, since the court below has rendered a motion to dismiss without determining the question of obscenity, then the materials are not entitled to the protection of the First Amendment and that would seem to dispose off the matter since no Fourth Amendment question is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.667" offset="1212362">Nearly 15 years ago in Roth, this Court decided that obscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected speech or press.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.877" offset="1265234">There is nothing in this Court’s subsequent decisions to indicate that this is still not the law and quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.055" offset="1309956">In Stanley against Georgia which is the basis of the decision of the court below, this Court said Roth and the cases following that decision are not impaired by today’s holding, that was in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.461" offset="1391562">In last term in Reidel, the Court quoted the language from Roth and said, Roth has not been overruled, it remains the law in this Court and governs this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.525" offset="1455824">In Thirty-Seven Photographs decided the same day, Mr. Justice White speaking for four members of the Court, reiterated the statement that obscenity is not within the scope of First Amendment’s protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.649" offset="1536281">If this material is obscene by any standard as I have contended and if obscenity is not protected by the First Amendment, then it would seem to follow that there is no constitutional basis.</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="456.963" offset="1901577">Or if you say that obscenity is not relevant in the case, it seems to me that it should not be disposed of on ground that obscenity has not been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.035" offset="1969809">Another approach leads to the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.635" offset="1996245">Stanley against Georgia held that obscene material seized in a man’s library in his home under a search warrant, authorizing a search for evidence of gambling materials could not be made the basis of a criminal prosecution for possessing the obscene items.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.588" offset="2100003">I find no basis for objecting to the result, though as I contended last week in Counselman against Hitchcock, some of the language used may have been unnecessarily broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.331" offset="2163010">As it was pointed out by the three concurring justices in that case, the decision is perhaps best rested on the Fourth Amendment as an illegal search, not adequately supported by the warrant which the officers had obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.941" offset="2237407">But on that basis, it is not a First Amendment case and has no application here.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.714" offset="2272516">This is borne out by the Court’s decision in the Reidel and Thirty-Seven Photographs cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.849" offset="2305117">The Reidel decision held that the rationale of Stanley was not sufficient to bar a prosecution of a person who on a commercial basis mailed obscene material to a recipient at his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.938" offset="2381394">Though Stanley had referred to the right to receive information and ideas, this right for receive was not sufficient to allow the recipient to obtain obscene material through the mails from a commercial mailer as against the right of the United States, constitutionally to forbid its passage through to the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.732" offset="2484630">And in Thirty-Seven Photographs, this conclusion was reached with respect to obscene material, a single set of 37 photographs which an individual had acquired abroad and sought to bring into the United States through customs with a view to using them in a commercial publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.153" offset="2590269">As indicated by my response to Mr. Justice Brennan's question, the sole difference between this case and Thirty-Seven Photographs, is that here the importation is allegedly to be for the personal use of the importer, and we have no evidence to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.674" offset="2672398">In view of Reidel however, that would seem to be a distinction without a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.223" offset="2702596">If a person cannot have things mailed to him without causing the mailer to commit a crime, it is rather hard to see that he should be able to bring things into the country himself as against the “broad and sweeping” powers of Congress to regulate foreign commerce and the traditional comprehensive power of this and all other nations over all materials entering the country at the borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.982" offset="2833626">Now this was the view of the four justices constituting the plurality in Thirty-Seven Photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.189" offset="2870406">They said in Thirty-Seven Photographs, the trial court erred in reading Stanley as immunizing from seizure, obscene materials possessed at a port of entry for the purpose of importations for private use.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.341" offset="2946997">And then obscene material maybe removed in the channels of commerce when discovered in the luggage of a returning foreign traveler, even though intended solely for his private use and the finally, a port of entry is not a traveler's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.885" offset="3037277">As I have contended the First Amendment does not apply since the material is obscene or must be taken as obscene and it is no less obscene, because it is imported to private use.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.592" offset="3092029">The Court would not hold I suppose that a person who would lawfully bring in narcotics or a hand grenade on the ground that he was going to use the narcotics or the hand grenade personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.240" offset="3146677">I know of no basis on which it can be determined, either under the First Amendment or otherwise that personal use provides some sort of a protection against otherwise applicable laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.896" offset="3209267">Now I suppose if the Court hold is a person can import foreign credit book, which violates an American copyright on the ground that he is going to use the book himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.166" offset="3266318">I well remember the (Inaudible) editions of American books, which we used to buy in Europe a generation ago, and there a clear statement that they could not be imported into the United States under the copyright laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.029" offset="3333819">I've read a Farewell to Arms in a (Inaudible) edition and took care to have it finished before I came home, perhaps this was unnecessary, if the decision below is sound, but I did not think so then.</text>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="831.364" offset="3399125">Because that was well before Stanley decided.</text>

          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="833.456" stopTime="1107.322">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="833.456" offset="3407484">That was before Stanley was decided, but this is the same constitution Mr. Justice and the same for First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.088" offset="3446041">Congress has sweeping power at our borders though its power to regulate foreign commerce, not power of course to violate the Constitution, but power under the Constitution to regulate foreign commerce in terms which are not qualified by the constitutional provision itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.582" offset="3560039">I can find nothing in the terms of the First Amendment, which limits the power of Congress to bar the importation of obscene materials, even when they are intended for private use.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.191" offset="3622419">It can be done, I suggest, only by erecting a very substantial penumbra around the First Amendment extending quite far beyond its terms and beyond the privacy of the home or the person which were involved in the Stanley case and in Griswold against Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.390" offset="3727223">Such an extension is not warranted by any constitutional precedent or standard that I know of.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.336" offset="3758988">If it were done, it is hard to tell how the limits of the penumbra could be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.081" offset="3790021">It would be I suppose whatever this Court thinks it should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.475" offset="3811546">Of course, constitutional improvisations cannot always be interpreted literally, but finding support in the First Amendment for the result reached by the court below would carry the Court farther way from the constitutional language, I submit, than the Court ought to go, and farther away from the language than is required or authorized by any prior decision of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.750" offset="3944666">Finally, let me suggest that any construction that the materials can be imported for personal use against the will of Congress, though not for commercial purposes, is not only unsupported by anything in the Constitution, but is too illusory and (Inaudible) a distinction to be erected into constitutional terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.975" offset="4069636">How is fact of personal use to be determined?</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.339" offset="4091056">Is the importer's statement to be conclusive either legally or as a practical matter?</text>

            <text syncTime="1023.286" offset="4166811">How in the ordinary case can the government counter the assertion of the importer, that his importation is for private purposes?</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.747" offset="4204637">Of course, if he brings in a bale of duplicate copies, it will look like a commercial importation, but the sophisticated will not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.464" offset="4251553">With the ready availability of duplicating machinery these days, a single copy suffices to make possible wide-scale distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.089" offset="4294080">How can the government, as a practical matter police this?</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.401" offset="4315291">What happens if the importer for private use dies or goes bankrupt?</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.537" offset="4343817">Can his trustee in bankruptcy sell the material along with the rest of bankrupt's valuable library on the ground that it was lawfully imported, indeed, constitutionally imported for private use and if not, why not?</text>

            <text syncTime="1272.021" offset="5161763">Appearing as a friend of the Court, we would urge that the statute in this case is unconstitutional because of overbreadth, because it would seek to deprive one Paladini, the citizen whose luggage was inspected on his way back to this country, of the right to receive information and ideas and to his private possession of that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.056" offset="5333858">In Stanley versus Georgia, the Court recognized two fundamental liberties encompassed within the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.289" offset="5378893">It recognized the right to receive information and ideas, regardless of their social worth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1375.062" offset="5573975">And I quote two sentences from Reidel, “the personal constitutional rights of those like Stanley,” said this Court, “to possess and read obscenity in their homes and their freedom of mind and thought, do not depend on whether the materials are obscene or whether obscenity is constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.930" offset="5697378">Their rights to have and to view that material in private, are independently saved by the Constitution.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1500.061" offset="6073959">The right to have and to view materials in privacy can be meaningful at all only if all places of privacy are given equal dignity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.108" offset="6122129">Materials can be possessed privately outside the home, such as in one's office, something which the appellant’s brief incidentally recognizes, in one’s luggage, in one’s clothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.269" offset="6186808">If Stanley had a right to possess for private use, obscenity in his home, surely it would be a rather narrow constitutional right, if as he stepped off the steps leading to his home with whatever he had in his pocket, that at that point the protection of the First Amendment would evaporate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.676" offset="6292343">It would be illogical and destructive of privacy to permit intrusion into the freedom of mind, and thought in private places other than the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.700" offset="6332467">And it could lead to an absurd result, that a man could be prosecuted for private possession of materials when he left his home, possessing books on his person, on his way to his office, or to take up another residence, or to retire to the privacy of a mountain cabin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.562" offset="6407908">The law recognizes that privacy is not restricted to one's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.594" offset="6432046">This Court has said that the law protects people, and not places.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.754" offset="6460676">Stanley versus Georgia, clearly doesn't derive its vitality, from the fact that Stanley's home was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.349" offset="6503099">The home is not a search proof heaven for possession of illegal materials to the contrary in Stanley itself, a valid search warrant to both local officers and federal officers in the Stanley's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.083" offset="6586064">But this Court vindicated Stanley's right to keep certain articles and there can be no difference between the kind of inspection under the Fourth Amendment in Stanley than the Customs inspection which took place with respect to the luggage of Paladini as he returned to this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.098" offset="6746037">If Stanley had a right of privacy, if he had a right regardless of the type of materials which he had, to possess in his home, should he not have a right to bring similar materials into this country and is it not irrelevant that a customs inspection took place as he arrived back in this country.</text>
