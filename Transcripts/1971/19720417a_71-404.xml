            <label>Mr. Alvin L. Goldman</label>
            <text syncTime="42.858" offset="245087">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.147" offset="250312">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.490" offset="267657">The appellant in this case Louis Colten was convicted under the Kentucky Disorderly Conduct Statute, Kentucky's Revised Statutes, 437-016.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.641" offset="312274">He was convicted under provision (f) of that statute, which can be found on page 2 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.768" offset="344771">The provision under which he was convicted, would read as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.145" offset="374237">A person is guilty of disorderly conduct if, with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he congregates with other persons in a public place and refuses to comply with a lawful order of the police to disperse.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.289" offset="458873">Two issues are presented in this case with respect to that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.762" offset="484682">One, whether the Kentucky Court of Appeals construction of that provision has rendered it unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.434" offset="523448">The other, whether the application of that statute to the facts in this case, is unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.263" offset="566707">The proceeding under which Mr. Colten was convicted, under which he was convicted in the judgment from which this appeal is being taken involves a two step trial procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.376" offset="631177">In Kentucky, misdemeanors carrying potential penalty of up to 12 months imprisonment and up to $500 fine, can be tried in an inferior criminal court as was Mr. Colten tried in an inferior criminal court in this situation, the Quarterly Court of Fayette County.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.487" offset="715605">The only way an appeal can be taken from that inferior court is by filing for a trial de novo in the court of general jurisdiction, the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.489" offset="767641">This is what Mr. Colten did in order to frame his constitutional challenges when he was convicted in the inferior court.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.713" offset="800555">When he was tried the second time, he was again convicted, but this time the penalty imposed upon him was increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.166" offset="838380">That aspect of the case raises the third issue presented before this Court.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="196.170" offset="858338">And what was the increased penalty?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alvin_l_goldman" startTime="198.409" stopTime="248.513">
            <label>Mr. Alvin L. Goldman</label>
            <text syncTime="198.409" offset="867324">In his case, it was a five-fold increase in a monetary penalty and increase from a $10 fine to a $50 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.274" offset="898775">In other case, pending before this Court on a petition for certiorari cases, Bell v. Commonwealth, number 70-5304, involves a much more dramatic increase in penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.797" offset="964813">In that case, the man had been fined and Quarterly Court $1 plus cost, cost paying a statutory requirement in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.490" offset="1003683">When he was retried in the Circuit Court, he will receive the penalty of $500 fine and 5 months 28 days imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.334" offset="1051017">That case also was brought under this disorderly conduct statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="257.177" offset="1102426">In the particular court in which Mr. Colten and Mr. Bell were tried, the court commissioner is a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.666" offset="1144326">The situation with respect to the Quarterly Courts, is that they are adjuncts of the County Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.365" offset="1191138">The County Court is for the most part an administrative position.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.916" offset="1209319">The County judge is in essence the County Administrator in Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.544" offset="1231889">The vast majority of County judges in Kentucky are not lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.550" offset="1247876">In a case of Fayette County, he happens to be a lawyer and in the case of Fayette County, the Quarterly Court commissioner who is appointed is a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.610" offset="1280163">It's my understanding though that frequently the County Judges were not lawyers, try these cases themselves and that where commissioners are appointed sometimes they are not lawyers.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.896" offset="1365218">There is no provision for transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.931" offset="1377443">My conversations on that matter with the prosecuting attorney in Fayette County, is that the defendant can secure a transcript by bringing his own court reporter and then it's a matter of the court reporter's certification being acceptable to any court which is later to review the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.139" offset="1470230">I would point out on that account that the appeal from the Quarterly Court is automatic -- not automatic but it's a matter of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.362" offset="1527073">One does not have to apply for commission to appeal, one does not have to show grounds for appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.287" offset="1550792">One can appeal as a matter of right and I think that probably the reason for the rule being that way is a recognition that the nature of the Quarterly Court proceeding is such, the nature and structure of the Quarterly Court is such that it is readily presumed that errors can and are frequently committed with respect to constitutional rights and even statutory rights and indeed in the opinion of the Court of Appeals below, the court recognized specifically that the nature of these inferior court trials are such, that all of the constitutional rights of a defendant are normally not protected.</text>

            <text syncTime="440.226" offset="1834586">The rule of the Court does permit that.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.146" offset="1850260">I would point out though that to say to a defendant, all you have to do is plead guilty is to say to a defendant, all you have to do is waive your Fifth Amendment rights, that there are decisions from this Court I believe with respect to the plead bargaining cases suggesting that it is not proper for a court to accept a plea of guilty unless the court is satisfied that indeed the defendant is meaningfully admitting his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.305" offset="2002919">That where the defendant feels that he is not guilty, it is improper for a court to impose any form of pressure on the defendant to come before a court and falsely swear, falsely say in open court, I am guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="863.891" offset="3529202">The facts out of which surrounding the arrest of Mr. Colten are, I think of some considerable significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.627" offset="3568176">In the background, we have initially a meeting of Mr. Colten and the officer who eventually took him into custody, Tuper(ph) Harlow at the airport terminal area.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.788" offset="3632855">Shortly before Mrs. Nixon's plane departed.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.377" offset="3647171">At that time officer Harlow testifies that Mr. Colten came up to him and said to him, we are going to have a party out here, and officer Harlow replied in effect not over here, you know.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.719" offset="3704535">He said, they then went off and conducted a scene somewhere nearby.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.216" offset="3738495">In this connection, he testified on cross examination to the effect that he was offended by Mr. Colten's appearance that in substance, he testified the fact that he thinks it's quite improper for a group of people looking like Colten looks to be hanging around in airport entrance where in his words an awfully a lot of important people are going in and out.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.438" offset="3847373">He did not make any arrest at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.968" offset="3857508">Shortly thereafter, a group that was at the airport was departing along the access road.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.449" offset="3883422">One of those departing was driving an automobile with an out-of-state license plate that had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.351" offset="3911112">Trooper Miller pulled the car that was driving with the out-of-date license off to the side of the road, pulled completely off to the side of the access road.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.625" offset="3956147">Trooper Miller pulled in behind that car and Mr. Colten who knew the driver of the car that was pulled over behind the trooper's car.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.295" offset="3994808">He got out of the car, he learned that the car that had been pulled was to be toed away.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.354" offset="4031066">There were total of five passengers in that car.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.111" offset="4042142">Mr. Colten had some room in his own automobile and at least one of the police officers conformed the testimony of the defense witnesses that Mr. Colten said when told to leave by police officers that he wanted to give a ride back to Lexington to these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.440" offset="4123435">The officer who apprehended Mr. Colten admitted that Mr. Colten indeed may have said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.793" offset="4160842">Any event -- some other cars pulled over to the side and there was a number of people variously estimated from about 12 to 18 throughout the area where the cars were pulled over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.542" offset="4219879">One officer testified that there was at one point at least, 15 persons in the access road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.372" offset="4255197">The captain who was in-charge of the detail out at the airport pulled up in the access road blocking that road, got out of his vehicle and told these people to leave, get in your cars and leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.825" offset="4324996">Other police officers stopped and similarly got out of their cars, went over to the crowd and said, leave, get in your cars and leave, you have no business here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1161.983" offset="4721639">Officer Harlow told Mr. Colten to leave several times and then grab Mr. Colten and started to lead him toward the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.788" offset="4764793">At that point, a group of other police officers came over, and record is fairly clear that Mr. Colten was at that point roughed up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.167" offset="4806380">I point that out not in any effort to win any sympathy for Mr. Colten, after all if he has any course for complaint about that, he has a civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.965" offset="4845564">But I think it is of significance in this case, because one of our contentions is that the interpretive gloss placed upon the statute by the Kentucky Court of Appeals, renders it excessively vague and over broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.142" offset="4910243">And this Court has frequently pointed out, that one of the deficiencies, constitutional deficiencies have penal statues which are excessively broad and over vague, is that they provide an invitation to abuse by law enforcement authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.031" offset="4981819">And I think there is good evidence to suggest that, in fact that is what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.906" offset="5001254">That when we look at the situation realistically, what we have here is a group of people who cause these police officers to have a long hard day of duty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.148" offset="6554286">His commanding officer Captain Mayes testified that he gave verbal instructions as to the security, the traffic flow not letting it by stop on the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.736" offset="6600575">I think this is normal precautions when you have a dignitary visiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.876" offset="6633175">And trooper Miller pulled Mendez's car over solely, because it had an expired license plate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1653.215" offset="6686570">He got out of his car, he proceeded up and asked trooper Miller, why he had stopped the Mendez car.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.865" offset="6761175">Colten's reply was, no I want to stay around and see, what's going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.253" offset="6786671">And he keeps badgering and trooper Miller is worried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.384" offset="6799210">He became obnoxious to the point that trooper Miller had to return to his cruiser in order to fill out the ticket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.888" offset="6833273">Captain Mayes (ph) was the next car to stop, the next police car to stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.866" offset="6853126">He came up and tapped on trooper Miller's car and asked him, what the problem was and did he have these people stop?</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.868" offset="6897117">Trooper Miller replied, no I have asked him to leave, I don't have him stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.310" offset="6914880">And Captain Mayes said, well I just want to check and then he proceeded along with, I believe it was lieutenant Maverley (ph) who was in his car proceeded to get out, and expressed general directions to the crowd, to please disperse, to leave, and he testified that he saw appellant in the crowd that he addressed this, these comments to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.246" offset="7010697">By this time there were some six to ten cars which Colten himself testified were part of the procession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.247" offset="7046642">That had gone to the airport together and were leaving together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.787" offset="7064823">And people were getting out of their cars, they were standing in the roadway.</text>

            <text syncTime="1756.367" offset="7099095">And I think that the access road must be understood, it is only a two lane road.</text>

            <text syncTime="2088.469" offset="8427579">And I think that in this case where we have got to apply the standards of vagueness and over breadth to the actual facts and appellant has made much of the fact that he feels his speech, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly was tightened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.943" offset="8505424">I don't think there is any standing for him to allege that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.485" offset="8519634">I don't think that he has any freedom of assembly, freedom of speech in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.452" offset="8555474">The police were merely trying to clear the roadway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.417" offset="8571357">They were not prosecuting appellant, he has made much all the way up here about his appearance and the fact that the police may have been down on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.694" offset="8620467">But I think that the exact opposite can be assumed from this record by virtue of the fact that they told him ten times to please leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.909" offset="8661322">Now, it seems absurd that he didn't understand them, that he didn't realize that they were asking him to leave and several police officers testified that they asked him please to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.158" offset="8726315">And he even states on his direct examination that I know better than to interfere with the police officer in whatever he was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.412" offset="8775321">So I hadn't said a word to the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.206" offset="8786501">Now, this is in contrast of the testimony of trooper Miller who says that Colten comes up and he has asked him why he has stopped the car and he is asked to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.466" offset="8839582">Now, the statute on its face, made me divide it into three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.316" offset="8862988">The first part is was their intent to call this any public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm or recklessly create a risk thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.911" offset="8909277">Now, I don't think that there is any great alarm here, any great annoyance, no tremendous inconvenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.099" offset="8950028">But, the fact that Mrs. Nixon was at the airport, one may assume that there was a fairly substantial crowd, as well-wishers wishing Mrs. Nixon a happy trip back and that they were leaving the airport at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.903" offset="9017319">Now, when you take six cars and pull them off on a shoulder and three police cars in the roadway, so that only one lane is open, you severely congested the traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.474" offset="9071549">Now, the main objective of police was they want to break it up, they weren't trying to arrest anybody, they weren't looking to bust anybody, they just wanted to get the traffic moving.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.707" offset="9120451">And I think the intent is clear by Colten's stopping, by his continued refusal to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.986" offset="9153574">Now, second part of the statute is did he congregate with others in a public place?</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.429" offset="9175412">I think there is ample testimony in the record that crowd was estimated from 12 to approximately 18 people that they were standing in the roadway.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.890" offset="12989185">I think the experience referred to when the Rice case was argued here indicates the contrary. If that were to be done it would be, of course, self-defeating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.853" offset="13029100">The purpose of the Quarterly Court is for the convenience of the state at least as much as and I think more than for the convenience of the defendant and this would only, in fact, force people to or encourage people to exercise their appeal to the circuit court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.737" offset="13100571">So I don't think that's very realistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.724" offset="13108617">And Mr. Justice White asked the question of what if we limit the Pearce decision to all but petty offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.466" offset="13147487">In the case of the Quarterly Court, jail is a realistic prospect, particularly, in cases of public drunkenness, which is a common sort of case to come before the Quarterly Court, disorderly conduct cases where it's a second or third offense, Quarterly Court does meet out jail sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.302" offset="13234841">Even if we are dealing with a much more, narrow definition of petty offenses, I still would argue that the concept of due process is applicable whenever the government of the Commonwealth of Kentucky or the government of the United States is acting vis-a-vis the citizenry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.154" offset="13310282">We're entitled no matter how serious the penalty imposed to a procedure that has an inherent fairness and I think therefore that when there is a purported --</text>

            <text syncTime="3397.152" offset="13662308">And I agree that the way the Kentucky Court of Appeals has construed this statute ad we find that instruction on pages 6 (a) and 7 (a) in the jurisdictional statement, that the way it has construed the statute indeed, any failure to obey the police officer would subject Mr. Colten to a penalty under the statute, unless Mr. Colten could establish that his predominant intent, was to assert a constitutional interest and even then, the Kentucky court would balance mere inconvenience to a police officer or some portion of the public against the asserted constitutional interest, not to balance this.</text>
