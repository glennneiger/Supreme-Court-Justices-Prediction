            <label>Mr. David C. G. Kerr</label>
            <text syncTime="55.167" offset="294318">Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.703" offset="308529">The petitioner here is Unterweser Reederei, a German corporation, domiciled in Bremen, Germany, the owner of the Seagoing tug Bremen.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.547" offset="347921">The respondent is Zapata Off-Shore Company, a multinational drilling company, owner of the drill rig self-elevated drill rig Chaparral.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.779" offset="392852">Very briefly the facts and circumstances which bring this case to this Court, have their genesis in a drilling contract, executed by and between Zapata or through it's wholly owned foreign subsidiary and Italian company by the name of (Inaudible) calling for presence of the drill rig Chaparral, off of Ravenna, Italy at the Adriatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.997" offset="489714">This necessitated of course, towing the Chaparral from it's sites off of Louisiana to the Adriatic, off of Ravenna.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.530" offset="527853">The Zapata solicited this for this towage voyage and several companies responded, including the petition here Unterweser.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.002" offset="573724">Unterweser was the low bidder and subsequently was requested to submit a contract and it did so, submitted a contract to Zapata in Houston and several changes were made in that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.832" offset="621058">It was executed by Zapata, Houston and the contract was then forwarded to Bremen where the changes were accepted and the contract was executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.520" offset="659719">The tow voyage commenced on about January 5, 1968 from the (Inaudible) Mississippi and some 5 days later in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico, a casualty occurred which precipitated a number of losses, very briefly the nature of casualty was a collapse of the three drilling legs and a parting of the tow line.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.973" offset="745609">The tow was reestablished by the tug Bremen and on orders from Zapata, it proceeded to the port of Tampa, Florida which was a nearest port of refuge.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.030" offset="781763">On arrival, at Tampa, the tug Bremen was met by United States Marshal and arrested in conjunction or in connection with a complaint which had been filed by Zapata the previous day, alleging negligent towage and basically a complaint in admiralty based on towage.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.496" offset="855637">That is the first litigation in this particular matter and very briefly, the complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.982" offset="885626">In that litigation, I indicated the day prior to the arrival of the flotilla in Tampa and subsequently, Unterweser filed a motion in the district court at Tampa, seeking among other things that the action in Tampa be stayed, pursuant to a foreign clause in a towage contract which provided that all disputes should be heard by the London Court of Justice in England.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.020" offset="1057720">The only thing we have in the record, Mr. Justice Brennan, is the fact that the Director of Unterweser said that without that clause, they would not have entered into this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.968" offset="1097531">The contract was submitted, as I have indicated, by the Unterweser to Zapata in Houston, was reviewed presumably by Zapata in Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.368" offset="1131177">They made several changes and initialed and sent back to Bremen.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.803" offset="1208917">What you're referring to Mr. Justice Brennan is the fact that the director from Unterweser, that's the affidavit of Eric Oswegon (ph), in which he said that normally Unterweser applies German law and German forums to their contracts but here, recognizing that this tow voyage would traverse many jurisdictions and as a compromise, they selected the London forum and then submitted that to Zapata and Zapata executed the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="347.383" offset="1463245">Zapata filed its motion, as I've indicated, seeking among other things to state.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.744" offset="1700646">As far as I know in this case, the English court has indicated and this I believe was in the Judge Karminski's decision in the London Court of Justice that presumably, English law would apply but whether the entire body or the English law including conflicts and whether you get into a (Inaudible) situation, I cannot answer that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="438.718" offset="1828542">The alternatives would be, you would get in the contact theory, as determined by what law should this contract be construed and what law should govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.018" offset="1861769">I think ultimately, you would get to the conclusion that the contract was executed in Bremen, Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.003" offset="1885698">And this I think would have considerable weight as I understand the cases that have dealt with contacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.925" offset="1905342">It's true you have an American National but that's outweighed by German National and German Flag Vessel.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.138" offset="1934285">So ultimately you come to the proposition that the contract was executed in Germany ultimately.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.697" offset="1976499">Following the filing of Zapata's motions speaking, to have this matter referred to London Court of Justice, the matter rested in the district court for some months.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.431" offset="2011399">In the meantime, the tug was released by agreement of the parties and Unterweser giving security in the amount of $3,500,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.182" offset="2054449">An action was instituted in London by Unterweser, based on breach of the towage contract and Zapata appeared in that action and objected to the action being brought in London.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.338" offset="2099066">Ultimately the London High Court of Justice ruled that the towage contract and its forum provision, particularly the forum provision was reasonable one and that was sustained on appeal in the Court of Appeal in London.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.279" offset="2278788">So it is correct that that action was pending in Tampa and pending on Zapata on Unterweser's motion to have the case referred to London and in accordance with the towage --.</text>

            <text syncTime="1007.450" offset="4103493">I would like to come back to that question on Bisso because I believe that the file analysis, or what you have here is a clash of policies that I think is going to be inherent in any decision this court might make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.732" offset="4184578">On the one hand, we have the so called the Bisso, Dixilyn policy wherein this court stated that it was a public policy, as a public policy matter, tugs should not be permitted to exempt themselves or insulate themselves from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.810" offset="4248943">We believe that in this particular case, there are overriding policy considerations which basically are making parties adhere or stick to their contracts particularly in an international context, where the parties has selected the forum, they've done so for a variety of reasons in an international contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.403" offset="4343298">Particularly, for certainty, for the law that will govern their contract and this is particularly true, we submit in a case, where the performance of the contract will traverse as was the case in this instance many, many jurisdictions and touched on many different -- the waters of many different nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.045" offset="4429920">So, we feel that number one in so far as Bisso sought to enunciate a US public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.358" offset="4459072">It is not all pervasive because in Bisso, Bisso can be circumvented by routine day-to-day commercial insurance practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.702" offset="4496480">This was recognize by Justice Frankfurt in his original, Mr. Justice Frankfurt in original dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.810" offset="4516960">And in fact and indeed is circumvented on a daily basis by simply having the tow purchase insurance and Unterweser way of subrogation against the tug.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.404" offset="4551337">The tug is completely insulated except to the extend of a small deductible perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.453" offset="4571503">So and in other fields of law, this court and other courts have recognize the right to limit one liability by contract or even to exculpate oneself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.907" offset="4617270">So we don't feel that Bisso was in all pervasive matter of public policy, but more importantly in the context of this case, we don't feel that Bisso is applicable because if you extend Bisso to cover this situation, and we feel it's distinguished well on its facts and circumstance but if this court should extend Bisso to that extent, it would have to do so by first of all adopting what we consider is a modern rule on forum contract provisions, that is that they are prima facie valid unless unreasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.491" offset="5391644">The drilling contract which is in the appendix that is a contract that's it wholly owned European subsidiary ended into the Italians interestingly enough, provides for a British forum and the applicability of British common law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.525" offset="5527794">Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.203" offset="5554543">Of course, I have my problem here right now but in view of some the questions that had been asked by served with the justice, I think I would reply to some of these questions, so it will be sensed fresh in your mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.022" offset="5609818">As to the towage contract, it says the provision that the court was inquiring about, with reference to the negotiation for the forum clause although Mr. Bond Oswegon (ph) makes a conclusory statement that he wouldn't have make the contract, he is the manging director of the Unterweser but for the forum clause, in the affidavit which was before the trial court below, regarding the party that signed the contract on behalf of Zapata, it states facts that after Zapata accepted Unterweser's there above mentioned, the contract of towage was drafted to Unterweser and mailed by from Bremen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.490" offset="5799676">Zapata and Houston, the draft included the clause any dispute arising must be treated before the London Court of Justice and this is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.221" offset="5830605">Before and after such draft was extended to Zapata for acceptance, there were no discussions between Zapata and Unterweser Reederei whatever concerning paragraph 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.352" offset="5871147">That further, he also denies that Mr. Oswegon (ph) had been mistaken that the parties “intended that the controlling law to be applied would below the forum English law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.242" offset="5914615">In no time, they had found Unterweser Reederei, discussed or mentioned what law was intended to throw in the vein of litigation, simply “after the low bid by a telegram was received and this is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.085" offset="5969995">Unterweser drafted this clause as Mr. Oswegon (ph) affidavit says, ordinarily we include German, an exclusive German forum clause which means a disclusion of any of them, which I will discuss later on one of the points in our brief and also we usually apply the application of German law, so that's a term of this record here, there is nothing that you cannot rightfully say that the parties agreed that these laws were applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="1744.229" offset="7050628">Now just in order to get to the crux of the things, the end results of this, if this court overruled this discretionary order entered by the limitation court, in which he determined he would assert and retain his jurisdiction, it will necessarily relegate Zathe product to London where under London law, the exculpatory clauses would defeat our claim and the American law being applied is outlined here before under Bisso and Dixilyn and Dixilyn, that was the freely negotiated contract where a reduced rates were given for an exchange for the exculpatory, this court per curiam on Bisso reversed the law court and held exculpatory clauses void and invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1813.541" offset="7327840">The legs are 44 stories tall, this bank had been carefully moved in 32 coast wise voyages on 32 previous occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.213" offset="7370576">Then it was decided to send the ship overseas on a drilling contract, in the Italian sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.969" offset="7401609">Special devices called the locking devices which are in the brief, on the deck, were to be installed on this huge 44 storey leg rig prior to a transocean crossing, this rig with those tall legs simply cannot take the road without the legs locked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.420" offset="7515399">Zapata instructed Bremen to tow the vessel coast wise in 250 foot water deeps, so that in event of a bad weather, it could jack down its legs, jack-up the rig and ride out to weather as I am sure you've heard about during the Hurricane season.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.018" offset="7593766">This was not a Hurricane period but this is was, and no other came through in January, instead of going coast wise and jacked up water dips, the rig was towed directly across, for in 10,000 feet of water, 150 miles from the nearest jacked up water dips, 250 feet, this bad weather hit, the legs rolled and finally all three broke off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.345" offset="7703062">There is a picture of the damaged rig in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.979" offset="7717587">Now, as I have stated under American law, this is not before – of course we can prove it but this, the court below is entirely considered the contention with the party when it gets to around to determining where is the evidence which I am going to discuss in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.266" offset="7782788">Now let's put this – let's focus in on what is at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.563" offset="7799924">Here is a case where after we filed suit, we took, we noticed and took 25 German's depositions including Mr. Oswegon, managing director tended by Mr. Kerr and his firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.234" offset="7882576">Thereafter they noticed, we noticed and they cross noticed and invoking the jurisdiction of the Tampa court and took depositions of Eight Americans on The Chaparral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.419" offset="7931373">After that, invoking the jurisdiction of court below, they took more depositions of the marine surveyors in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.887" offset="7969198">They also filed motion for discovery and we produced documents and the file of the case, I could not put it all on this tape, this case has been deposed and it's substantially was ready for trial in the first suit which we filed when Mr. Kerr's client decided to file the limitation of liability procedure and let me tell you what that is, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.168" offset="8090406">He mentioned that he made a special appearance when he filed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.261" offset="8110782">We will just read the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.572" offset="8119977">Under our rules of practice, you cannot make a special appearance in going and filing a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.494" offset="8143696">Let me tell you what a limitation liability proceeding is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.937" offset="8165430">Under 181, of 46 US Code, Congress provides that a ship owner may limit his liability to the value of the vessel as he can show us not a fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.687" offset="8220391">183 provides, it may file its own proceeding, a limitation liability proceeding, that does so within six months after of notice of written claim, and assert that it is entitled to limit its liability to the value of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.859" offset="8297087">Rule F of the rules, supplemental rules, Civil Procedure elaborate upon that procedure and spells out in quite detail which we will mention in our brief as to the procedure that he needs to go through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.250" offset="8370648">Not only does Rule F allow the petitioner ship owner to assert that he is (Inaudible) to liability, but he is entitled to claim he is exonerated from any and everybody's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.578" offset="8428013">Now what happened here is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.399" offset="8443268">He could have filed this indefensively as the courts have held, it is cited in the brief, this case doesn't turn on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.306" offset="8478899">What he did was, was to file this suit, and in the suit, he claimed these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.962" offset="8509515">It was all the fault of the Chaparral, that there were other potential claimants, and the crew members that were on there, were somewhat hurt getting off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.024" offset="8565835">And he wanted a concourse, where all these claims could come into the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.848" offset="8601048">He got an injunction out and he enjoined the suit that was being litigated in the Tampa District Court, enjoined it and cited us Zapata to come in and file our claim, it will be served with the main issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2303.649" offset="9288277">In the British Transport case this Court categorized the limitation proceeding as one, that constitutes it as a cross liable between it and the claimant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2352.577" offset="9483987">The basis of motion this day is solely on the basis of the forum clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.093" offset="9510109">He is set on an entitled exoneration from the world, he says that I am entitled to limit my liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.717" offset="9540516">He had sued us and he had filed this and come in there and we have cross claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="2385.131" offset="9614181">And furthermore, he filed a brand new thing called salvage.</text>

            <text syncTime="2394.569" offset="9652006">He claims that everything that happened after, after the legs were lost, was outside the contract, that he, in other words, as if were stranger, he came up to rig, cut a line on it and tow this into nearest port of refuge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.060" offset="9709893">He was asked for the Admiral court below to give him an award for salvage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.263" offset="9734762">Well the vessel was worth about $ three million dollars after rig, and it's not unusual for an Admiral court to give, say 10% or something like that, like that would amount to $300,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="3439.477" offset="13831598">And they look at these factors and Mr. Kerr in urging this on the court, said to the court among other facts that you can consider, is whether or not the plaintiff, we were plaintiff there at that stage, would be deprived of this remedy if you were relegated to the forum court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.748" offset="13920728">In the Second Circuit after this reasonable -- the Forum Clause maybe enforced if reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.938" offset="13953433">The case is on there head in situation cited in the brief that where the plaintiff would be deprived of his remedy in the jurisdictional forum, stipulated forum, that in that instances that is a proper consideration and that they could keep the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.689" offset="14028457">Now the reasonableness of this thing and we have covered this clearly, where they include nationalities of the the parties, place to form the contract, deprivation of remedy and then the balance of convenience of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.815" offset="14080911">And I am hoping to clear this in one moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.815" offset="14088956">The trial court found that the balance of convenience is strong in his forum, all the evidence of the Zapata liability, and damages is in the merits about forum depositions of 40 witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.003" offset="14145694">Toed because of tremendous amount of repairs and liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.051" offset="14157920">All the evidence is to the German Unterweser as to toe line approach is in Florida where there is survey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.600" offset="14184042">The salvage suit testimony has been taken but a deposition, is to what the service it was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.264" offset="14202746">That preserved the depositions of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.596" offset="14212045">The only thing that we will have to calculate would be the hire of the tug which it didn't get because it didn't finish the voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.851" offset="14249139">I think it's most important that this court in deciding the case that I do believe you would find it, the worse of a standpoint that the forums clause is not enforceable, ipso facto, no case holds that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.515" offset="14307758">They all say you must -- the court must look at all the circumstances and we have detailed very much in our brief all of those sayings and there is a fact time with courts that the balance of convenience is strongly there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.276" offset="14354778">This is an equity court, he exercised his best judgment where he should do on the circumstances and I don't think that the Unterwerser has shown to this court any abuse of that discretion, I thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. David C. G. Kerr</label>
            <text syncTime="3592.097" offset="14442027">Mr. Chief Justice if it please the court, I have several factual points I think should be cleared up that were raised by questions from the court, but first of all in order to decide what the lower court, the District Court determined or held with respect to our motion, our original motion filed in the initial action to stay this proceeding and have it referred to London Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.988" offset="14537636">You must go to the Court's original order, which is I think has been pointed out was filed as submitted or entered some six months after our motions was originally filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.660" offset="14588313">In that order the District Judge committed what we think is the fundamental error in this case with respect to how he approached the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.347" offset="14619033">And he held and I am reading from page 82 of the Appendix which is Judge Princeton's order of July 29, 1968 and I am reading from the next to last paragraph on that page and the last sentence of that paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.379" offset="14675249">We think this is crucial to show the misunderstanding that the court had at this entire issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.722" offset="14696564">The balance of conveniences here is not strongly in favor of defendant that being Zapata and plaintiff's choice of forum should not be disturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.696" offset="14740450">This means that as of that date with the initial action filed, the District Court found that the balance of convenience was in Unterweser's favor, although not strongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.451" offset="14783500">Then he went on to say and plaintiff's choice of forum should not be disturbed which is of course applying the forum non-convenience rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.888" offset="14813280">But, the difference between the forum non-convenience rule is a critical difference, and the difference between the choice of forum situation is that the initial choice of forum is not the District Court intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.310" offset="14858942">The initial choice of forum here is London.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.529" offset="14871794">So he first of all found that the balances of conveniences were in favor of Unterweser and then he said, he applied the presumption that Zapata's choice of forum was Tampa which of course it was not by contract his choice of forum was London from the very beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.095" offset="14930099">I make that point because I think it is critical to the decision of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.892" offset="14949221">Now, there were several factual points I think that should be cleared up Mr. Justice White you ask whether -- you asked Mr. Nance, whether or not insurance was mentioned or discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.101" offset="14990076">Mr. Nance is incorrect, when he said it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.710" offset="15004496">Insurance was mentioned, in the original telegraphic bid sent by Unterweser to Zapata in response to solicitation for bids which appears on page 295 of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.647" offset="15048277">Unterweser agreed or offered to arrange for insurance for Zapata and then subsequently in the towage contract that's clause 2 B, and the towage contract appears in several points in this Appendix, but the one I am refereeing to is on the page 72.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.631" offset="15120166">In the towage contract, it was stipulated that insurance would be for the account of the owner, that is the owner of the towage, Zapata.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.272" offset="15150782">So insurance was mentioned and the decision to go and insure was here decision marrest of the tugade by choice, by Zapata.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.069" offset="15185995">So I don't feel that, that really has as far as it's saying it is here uninsured, it was given the opportunity to get insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.022" offset="15213789">It was told that insurance would be for its account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.279" offset="15222775">So insurance was discussed by the party and mentioned in the documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.966" offset="15241583">The second factual point is with respect to all of these depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.280" offset="15254853">It is true that a lot of depositions were noticed initially when the tug first arrived in Tampa de bene esse, we move for protective orders twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.790" offset="15292888">In the second protective order when we were aware of all of the facts and had consulted with our German clients we specifically pointed out that this clause might well be tried in London and therefore some of the discovery that taken here might well have to be repeated, but the court orders to go ahead and we then also engage in discovery depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.661" offset="15368329">Once the court has said that it was not impressed with our argument and in any event we feel this is immaterial because we have stipulated that all discovery undertaken in United States will be admissible in the London action subject to the ordinary rules of evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="4143.768" offset="16648747">One important factor that we also want to make very clear is with respect to the limitation action, we were faced of course with the moment, an action is filed inevitably, a claim in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.975" offset="16713636">Limitation, a petition for limitation or as the party defendant seeking limitation, this is almost an inevitable consequence of that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.055" offset="16753864">So that we had to protect our security in this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="4176.390" offset="16779255">So what we did was a reactional protective measure, avail ourselves of a protective device at a time when the court had not yet approved on our original motion, and therefore we reasserted in that petition as I have indicated before and this is in the appendix, we reasserted the paramountacy of our forum provision and the stay, the motion for stay.</text>

            <text syncTime="4217.932" offset="16945394">We might then be called upon to post security if any other actions were filed and secondly and perhaps more importantly, there is balance in the law at the present time that we cited the cases and the comment by Gilmore and Blacks on that point, there is doubt at the present time whether defensive limitation is permissible after six months have expired and that comes about as the moral castle amendment, 1937 when the six months provision was first introduced in the law and it's not entirely clear at this point in decisions since then whether you can file defensive limitation after the expiration of six months and in any event, what Zapata argues is that in the limitation proceeding, we are invoking the benefits of the Limitation Act, the privilege as they put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.183" offset="17134416">Well, you invoke that by answer or by petition, so you are subject to the same objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.823" offset="17176943">There has been an urging here with respect to Carbon Black and that our forum provision in this case is governed by Carbon Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.884" offset="17213201">There are several distinctions, they are made in the brief but the principle ones are in Carbon Black, the Forum Clause related only to actions against the master, owner or agent, that is it was person stipulated who could not be sued and Fifth Circuit ceased upon that to say that this was directed in personam suits and not in rem suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4306.997" offset="17301704">So that's one distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4307.981" offset="17305570">The second distinction is that Carbon Black is a carriage of (Inaudible) case and therefore governed by the provisions of that Federal Statute and that does make a difference and that difference I think is officially discussed in briefs.</text>
