            <text syncTime="28.252" offset="187085">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.011" offset="198161">The substantive issue in this case is whether anything in the Constitution of the United States requires the virtual destruction of private clubs in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.477" offset="248003">But before I can reach that question, the rules require that I reach the jurisdictional issue which the Court postponed.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.432" offset="279768">Before I can usefully do either, I must re-sketch the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.008" offset="302129">Appellant Moose Lodge is a private club in every respect and the parties have so stipulated in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.001" offset="330132">It has selective and invitational membership procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.219" offset="346955">Admission to the club house is restricted to members and their guests.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.568" offset="364300">It has never received, and isn’t now receiving any public funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.273" offset="383213">It’s club house is not located on public property.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.542" offset="396274">It performs no public functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.529" offset="404215">It conducts no community activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.165" offset="414769">It has never ask for public assistance either from courts or police in the conduct of it affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.454" offset="443921">It's never sought public patronage through advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.787" offset="457192">It’s not a recent transformation.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.695" offset="464819">There is no sham or substitutes here.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.531" offset="476209">It is a non-profit corporation, controlled by its membership and the object of its bounty are Mooseheart which is an orphanage and school and Mooseheaven which is a home for the elder. Now here is all that Moose Lodge receives from public bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.794" offset="541306">It has a occupancy permit for its building.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.708" offset="552904">It has an operating permit for its elevator.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.432" offset="563771">It has a health permit for its restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.250" offset="575056">It gets also what every private residents within the city limits gets, water, steam heat, and trash removal for which it pays and it has a club liquor license from the Commonwealth.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.060" offset="634302">Moose Lodge's membership is restrictive as is that of other clubs and organizations in this country that include more than 70,000,0000 Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.295" offset="675262">Restriction are; first Male, second Caucasian and not married to a non Caucasian, third belief in the supreme being.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.634" offset="716640">I better read from the court's findings as to how this case arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.366" offset="743494">A Caucasian member in good standing brought plaintiff, a Negro to the lodge's dining room and bar as his guest and requested service of food and beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.967" offset="789992">The lodge through its employees refused service to plaintiff, solely because he is a Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.097" offset="818517">There upon, the plaintiff Mr. Irvis, who is the majority leader of the Pennsylvania house of representatives brought this action against the Moose Lodge and the members of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, alleging the unconstitutionality of the Pennsylvania Liquor Code as applied, because it did not prohibit the issuance of club licenses to clubs with racial membership restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.383" offset="931575">The three-judge court held that liquor regulation by Pennsylvania was so pervasive that Moose Lodge's membership restrictions were there by transformed into State action, but it made a significant qualification which I’d better read in preference to characterizing, this is from page 40 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.188" offset="1022795">Nothing in what we hearsay implies a judgment on private clubs which limits participation to those of a shared religious affiliation or a mutual heritage in national origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.873" offset="1085593">Such cases are not the same as the present one where discrimination is practiced solely on racial grounds and the judgment was that either the Moose Lodge had to drop it’s racial restrictions or else lose its liquor license.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.936" offset="1153825">Moose Lodge moved to modify that judgment so as to permit Mr. Irvis guest privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.395" offset="1175663">He opposed that it was denied by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.513" offset="1188098">This appeal followed and Your Honors postponed jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.346" offset="1203458">Now under the rules I must argue that jurisdictional point first.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.008" offset="1338145">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.726" offset="1349012">Now one of the points on which we agree with Irvis is that the complaint did in did state a cause of action within the jurisdiction of a three-judge court because it is an action to enjoin state wide legislation on the ground that as applied, it denied the plaintiff the equal protection of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.148" offset="1442635">Now it's just not like that Texas University case where the legislation wasn’t a state wide application.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.869" offset="1473564">It wasn’t like that Native American Church case where some of the members of the court couldn’t find an allegation of unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.203" offset="1502925">Here that allegation was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.537" offset="1516196">I don’t think it would be proper to both or helpful to the Court for me to discuss the cases in detail, they are all set out in our break.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.957" offset="1549946">We think that even though jurisdiction originally attached and of course the touch tone is the compliant, it was thereafter laws and it is our view that there is no present case for controversy because the decree gives Irvis no personal redress, but to the contrary is a judgment punitive in character and legislative in it’s application.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.286" offset="1651196">Now they stipulated that the loss of a liquor license would seriously impair Moose Lodge's ability to contribute to the benevolent purposes of the supreme lodge.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.462" offset="1691948">Irvis didn’t ask for damages, he did not sue as a tax payer, he didn’t bring a class action, he doesn’t seek membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.251" offset="1723085">He repeatedly conceded here and below the right of the Moose Lodge to exclude him, and he repeatedly said that there was nothing illegal in its doing so and he rejected modification of the judgment which would have let him in as a guest.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.297" offset="1783272">So that all he wants is to have the Moose Lodge lose its liquor license and we say he has no personal stake in that anymore than any of the 12,000,000 other inhabitants of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.149" offset="1834681">So that --</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="440.533" offset="1836248">You are saying that there is no longer a case of controversy?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frederick_bernays_wiener" startTime="442.619" stopTime="789.666">
            <label>Mr. Frederick Bernays Wiener</label>
            <text syncTime="442.619" offset="1844607">Yes, Your Honor, and having done our duty by raising the jurisdictional question, I ask for the substantive issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.313" offset="1891314">By way of essential preliminary, I must deal with the district court's suggestion that there is somehow a difference between racial restrictions on the one hand and religious or ethnic restrictions on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.970" offset="1949933">Now that, to put it most gently is completely mistaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.111" offset="1966547">There is no constitutional distinction whatever between state action that discriminates either on races -- racial or religious or ethnic grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.139" offset="2014612">It is simply not true that the Constitution sustains the anti semi while denouncing the anti hemi (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="492.476" offset="2043974">It is simply not true that some groups are entitled to more equal protection than others.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.914" offset="2065708">What this purported distinction really does is picking and choosing among association and groups on the bases of their beliefs and preference which seems to me a most glaring denial of due process because all three restrictions are equally bad if the membership requirements are indeed state action and interestingly enough that is the one of the few points on which the Attorney General of the Commonwealth agrees with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.673" offset="2188796">He says they are all equally bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.054" offset="2206246">Therefore, if the private club with the racial restriction can't have a liquor license because those restrictions are state action, then either can any other private club with religious or ethnic distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.298" offset="2263298">So that if the judgment below is correct, scores of millions of Americans now associated in all manner of private clubs can't have liquor licenses either and since precedents invariably build on each other, the next will be they will risk losing building permits, restaurant permits and all the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.877" offset="2345636">Irvis says they are all different, but there is a main statue that makes the racially restricted club lose its restaurant permit also, while not taking it away from the religiously or ethnically restrictive club.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.664" offset="2408748">Fortunately for the continued pluralistic existence of the republic and the Elks' brief amicus documents this statement that we are indeed a nation of jointness.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.434" offset="2455768">The decision below is wrong for three separate reasons which I shall discuss in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.679" offset="2484816">First, the First Amendment right of associational privacy protects private clubs and fraternal organizations from any and all state efforts, directed at the full exercise and joined under that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.067" offset="2558377">Second, the issuance of a liquor license does not and cannot transform the acts of the licensee into those of the licensing authority and three, Congress in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has twice drawn a line between these apparently competing Constitutional rights by accepting from the public accommodations title, private clubs not in fact open to the public and by forbidding the Civil Rights Commission from investigating the membership practices and the internal operations, both of private clubs and a fraternal organization and I will take first the right of associational privacy which it seems to us can be viewed in either negatively or affirmatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.079" offset="2758370">Negatively it is the proposition that social rights are not enforceable in the courts or by law and for this proposition I draw on the dissenting opinion of the elder justice Harlan in the civil rights cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.149" offset="2818661">I better give that citation because it is not in brief, 109 US at 59.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.551" offset="2844261">I agree that government has nothing to do with social as distinguished from technically legal rights of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.016" offset="2878116">No government has ever brought or ever can bring its people into social intercourse against their wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.908" offset="2905701">Whether one person will permit or maintain social relations with another is a matter with which government has no concern I agree that if one citizen chooses not to hold social intercourse with another, he is not and cannot be made amenable to the law for his conduct in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.270" offset="2979157">For even upon grounds of race, no legal right of the citizen is violated by the refusal of others to maintain nearly social relations with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.141" offset="3018654">Now that as I had indicated is a dissenting opinion, but it is in an area where the dissents of the elder Justice Harlan have now moral weight than those of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.889" offset="3069645">Affirmatively there is a right of constitutional right of liberty of association which is documented by many decisions of this Court and which amounts to this that in my home and in my club and in my chose of business associates, I can act on my prejudice as even those of race, I -- they can -- my preferences maybe enlightened, they maybe eccentric, they may be bigoted, they may represent prejudices, they may represent postjudices, but in my private domain, I can exclude whom I want and for any reasons and as indicated there is no doubt here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1271.253" offset="5159128">Your Honor, I am not an expert of liquor regulation in the several states, but if you -- if you say that Pennsylvania is so pervasive, you got to have to test the other 50 states to see whether there are differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.664" offset="5216702">Now the notion that the - the court below espoused that it was liquor regulation was more continues that other regulations, the bar isn’t regulated anymore continuously than the restaurant and as for the so called pervasive regulation what is pervasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.053" offset="5294338">Look at building codes, look at building codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.219" offset="5314922">This is the Pennsylvania Liquor Code, this is the Building Official's Conference of America Basic voca, basic building code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.203" offset="5346896">My figures are that some 800 municipalities have adopted these codes in full or in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.462" offset="5371974">Now, I don’t think that one is more pervasive than the other and I think you going to have an awful time if you are going to try to compare every area of regulation against liquor regulation to see whether one is or is not pervasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.831" offset="5465388">I just think that to say that the pervasiveness of a regulation transforms the acts of the licensee into those of the licensing authority is just to rewrite the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.767" offset="5521185">Now, the Constitution says no state, no state shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.422" offset="5559742">It doesn’t say no person licensed by a state, it doesn’t say no person pervasively licensed by a state and indeed Your Honors our entire recent constitutional history warns against two great departures from the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.410" offset="5635706">Take liberty of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.932" offset="5641766">What a sorry chapter that was from Lochner v. New York through Morehead against Tipaldo or take the immunity of governmental instrumentality which -- which emphasis the value of looking to the text rather than its exajesus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.195" offset="5714909">Mr. Justice Frankfurter when that doctrine was overruled said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.793" offset="5753257">The judicial history of this doctrine of immunity is a striking illustration of an occasional tendency to encrust on wide interpretations upon the Constitution and thereafter to consider merely what has been judicially said about the Constitution rather than to be primarily controlled by a fair conception of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.463" offset="5835908">Judicial exajesus is unavoidable with reference to an organic act like our Constitution, drawn in many particulars with purpose of vagueness so as to live room for the unfolding future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.452" offset="5883869">But the ultimate touch stone of constitutionality is the Constitution itself and not what we have set about and the Constitution says no state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.826" offset="5929427">Now the third ground for reversal is the congressional action in the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.005" offset="5966103">There are two previsions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.793" offset="5973208">First, is Section 203E which exempts from the operation of the public accommodations title, private clubs that are not in fact open to the public and then perhaps even more significantly the Section 504A which forbids the Civil Rights Commission from examining the membership practices and the internal operation of private clubs and fraternal organizations and that is the commission as Your Honors please that Congress directed to collect information concerning the denial of equal protection and the weren’t to look into private clubs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.848" offset="6145512">Congress, as the legislative history shows wanted to protect the constitutional right of private association from interference by the commission and that is clear from the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.519" offset="6196189">Finally, there is a Thirteenth Amendment point which has been raised up to page 39, of his brief here, Irvis said the injury suffered by Irvis was not just that a private organization barred him because he was black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.868" offset="6273512">This, it was entitled to do, but 70 pages later he contents that to have bargained was a badge or incident of slavery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.945" offset="6317815">Well, now that is just doesn’t wash because the Moose restriction is Caucasians only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.208" offset="6350939">That bars American Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.086" offset="6362432">American Indians not only weren't never systematically enslaved, but they had Negro slaves of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.093" offset="6390436">The freed men of Choctaw and Chickasaw and Seminole Nations, so that clearly Caucasians only is not badge or incident of slavery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.748" offset="6441113">So that we say a jurisdiction isn’t lost or if it can't be regained by a memo, the judgment below must be reversed with directions to dismiss for failure to safeguard (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="1610.897" offset="6517704">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.713" offset="6532960">Like Mr. Wiener, I would like to begin with a brief discussion of the preliminary jurisdictional issue which the court has asked us to argue and I would like to note as Mr. Wiener did that both parties agree that a three-judge court jurisdiction was proper in this case and therefore approach the issue from another angle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.564" offset="6620313">I would like to approach it from the standpoint of what this case is not with respect to the three-judge court problem and I would take my text from the citations which appeared just a little over a month ago in this Court's opinion in Board of Regions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.915" offset="6681753">The citations, twice as I recall, to the case of Phillips versus The United States, I believed in this Court, United States versus Phillips in which Justice Frankfurter discussed the three-judge court problem in some depth and pointed out that the touch stone in these cases where we have legislative action or administrative action is whether or not there has been some lawless exercise of authority by some administrative agency of the Commonwealth, Pennsylvania in this case or some state official in the Phillips case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.723" offset="6820934">And I think when you raise or cast this case in terms of whether or not there has or has not been a lawless exercise of authority, you realize that this is not the Phillips case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.580" offset="6880388">This is a case in which the State Liquor Board acting pursuant to powers granted to it only by the State Liquor Code and acting strictly in accordance with the previsions of that State Liquor Code has granted and renewed a license to a private club in conformity with the provisions of that state liquor code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.638" offset="6960636">Consequently this case does not involve the type of lawless, unauthorized administrative action which the Court in the Phillips case held would preclude three-judge court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.324" offset="7015389">I think it goes without saying of course that this is not a case like Board of Regents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.604" offset="7032525">This is not a case in which only a purely local issue is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.714" offset="7048930">This is a case in which a state wide statue, depicting state wide policy of state wide application is presented to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.715" offset="7080904">I think we need not dwell on that particular aspect of the three-judge court problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.922" offset="7101802">I would point out that this case goes further than a case in the area of liquor regulation in which this Court has upheld three-judge court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.284" offset="7139210">In the case of Idlewild v. Epstein, the New York Liquor case involving the store at New York airport, the Court upheld three-judge court jurisdiction there in an attack on a special provision of the New York liquor law which applied only to one particular complainant the Idlewild liquor shop at the New York airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.378" offset="7223637">That shop claiming that it was not required to get a license because of its peculiar operations in which it sold only to passengers in foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.853" offset="7261463">Well, our case is much broader than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.472" offset="7272016">Our case involves statewide application of Pennsylvania's liquor laws to hundreds of state wide and local club organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.486" offset="7312036">Consequently if Phillips is good law if Idlewild is good law, if Board of Regents is good law as I urge that they all are, then this case does present a case for a three-judge court jurisdiction and does present a case for appeal to this Court from the decision of the court below.</text>
