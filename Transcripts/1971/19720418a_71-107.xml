            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="12.523" offset="123809">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.493" offset="135720">Yesterday, I was naming some of the problems that would face the court, if contribution were now to be allowed as a general proposition and I was pointing out that the first problem of course would be the Harbor Workers Act and I was saying that the Erie and Atlantic are not joint tortfeasors owing a common duty in tort to Benazet, the injured party because while Atlantic owes that duty to Mr. Benazet , Erie's duty is quite different, mainly to pay compensation under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.712" offset="308547">I want to make it clear of course that Benazet never sued Eries in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.779" offset="324847">Benazet sued Atlantic and Erie was in pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.572" offset="339998">Therefore, even if the contribution is not absolutely barred as a general proposition, you must then decide whether the Act, in view of the very clear language nevertheless makes Erie somehow subject to contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.733" offset="400602">Now, the second problem I'd like to point out is that if you said contribution was somehow available, what do you do about the conflict between contribution and Erie's own Right to Indemnity in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.755" offset="464759">Of course it was not appropriate in the Trial Court here to submit to the jury, Erie's claim for indemnity because under Erie's theory neither under state law nor Maritime Law nor any other law, did it owe anything, and therefore, the question of indemnity never arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.499" offset="543753">But if you were now to say the contribution, contribution was available to Atlantic upon remand, Erie could, we submit, obtain indemnity against Atlantic as the real party at fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.081" offset="602058">Now, if I may, ask the Court's indulgence to turn to page 13 of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.506" offset="647720">This is the Atlantic's complaint against Erie and in paragraph 6 there on page 13, you will see what they charged Erie with.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.625" offset="704249">This is all they charged Erie with and this is all -- the only reason Erie got into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.817" offset="720968">In plain language, in paragraph 6, they charges with nothing more than a failure to inspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.552" offset="751897">Now, you have held in Ryan and (Inaudible), repeatedly, “where there is a duty of seaworthiness on the part of the ship owner, the ship owner can then implead the party really responsible for the accident if the ship owners' only duty was to inspect and can obtain indemnity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="201.540" offset="879897">That's precisely our situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.919" offset="893376">They claim we failed to inspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.858" offset="901108">We would show that this was their car, that over two-year period it became in terrible shape and they didn't do anything about it, and so forth and we would say that we are entitled to indemnity here.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="218.691" offset="948442">What's the view of that basis for the indemnity toward a contract?</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="224.069" offset="969967">The basis for the indemnity in this case would probably be both.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.197" offset="986476">It would be a duty on behalf of the owning line in contract, not to pass along its own car to a connecting carrier when it was not in proper shape and in tort for imposing upon others a defective car.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.547" offset="1071845">It would might well be both or either.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="256.858" offset="1101102">I think indemnity is usually a contractual indemnity or warrant, either contractual warranty, but the lower courts Your Honor have now developed a theory of, of sort of tort indemnity or quasi contractual indemnity and whether that would apply here and whether this Court would accept that, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.346" offset="1191067">But in view of the fact that I think we could recover under either theory, I don't think it controls here.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.604" offset="1220116">In any event, under your prior cases, since we would clearly be entitled to the indemnity against Atlantic, now what do you do with the conflicting claim of contribution whereas the parties would somehow split the judgment 50-50 or otherwise and our claim for complete indemnity, that's the next point you would have to resolve here.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.690" offset="1324501">Then you come to the problem of the conflict between various statutes here.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.958" offset="1361490">As you remember in Halcyon, one of the reasons the Court didn't want to say there was contribution was that Congress had passed all these other statutes and that contribution was somehow going to fit into the pattern established by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.709" offset="1416556">Just to give you an example here, there is a Limitation Liability Act and we would be limited to the value of the car flow and to the cargo, which is not in the record, but I am told that it's somewhere around $34,000, $35,000, $40,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.747" offset="1484684">Now, what do you do?</text>
            <text syncTime="353.564" offset="1487923">If you're going to say there is a 50-50 split, we owe 100,000 but you have got the Limitation Liability Act, we only owe 35,000 or 40,000, what about the Harbor Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="362.994" offset="1525644">You are going to have to work this contribution in somehow to all these other statutes, is that a problem?</text>
            <text syncTime="369.574" offset="1551975">There are other problems which unfortunately I don't have time to go into such as what the proper split would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.752" offset="1584680">We think the Court of Appeals' opinion in Halcyon ought to control or ought to be strictly based on fault and not 50-50 and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.072" offset="1621983">They're a number of problems which you would have to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.938" offset="1633477">In conclusion, let me simply say that to grant contribution now after 20 years of Halcyon would have an extremely unsettling effect on Maritime Law generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.915" offset="1689379">It would throw out the carefully drawn line between indemnity and contribution which has been established by this case and so many cases and it would in fact create a conflict between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.344" offset="1743087">It would dilute the owner's responsibility to correct effects because from their standpoint, let's face it, the way these railroad cars go by the luck of the draw, this car is probably going to end up on somebody's else's line rather than theirs, and therefore, if you're going to dilute responsibility around among the various lines who had the car or even share it with the one where the accident happen to happen, so much the better for the owning line.</text>

            <text syncTime="468.309" offset="1946947">It developed slowly and that during that time, if the car had been properly inspected, these defects would have been discovered.</text>

            <text syncTime="553.941" offset="2289464">If so, was such negligence, a substantial factor in bringing about plaintiff's injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="562.787" offset="2324886">Now Judge Cooper in his opinion also found that Erie was negative -- pointed out the jury had so found and the Erie's negligence was approximate cause as was Atlantic's.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.033" offset="2389879">Judge Cooper found not that there was no intervening cause as was such stated yesterday, but that there was no superseding cause and that we admit.</text>

            <text syncTime="607.805" offset="2504922">Well, I might call Your Honor's attention to a case cited in our petition for certiorari on page 6, Chicago Rock Islandrailroad against Chicago North Western railroad in the Eighth Circuit and I think that that case illustrates pretty clearly that the primary responsibility for an unsafe car, lies with the railroad upon whose tracks, the unsafe car is at the time of the accident.</text>

            <text syncTime="684.248" offset="2810659">Rock Island left it on the interchange and Northwestern picked it up and the Court indicated that Northwestern had the primary responsibility to inspect that car and it was on there lines and they have the primary liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.122" offset="2866143">Now we were also told yesterday that this car was never in (Inaudible) by Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.577" offset="2896027">Well, if it had been in their shop and the evidence says that you could notice this, the decay and the fissure from the ground, if the car had been in their shop, we wouldn't have had the accident and we wouldn't have been here now and we maintain that it was their duty and their duty not only to Benazet, but also their duty to us to inspect that car and to put it in the shop and to fix it and it was that duty to us that they have violated and it was one of their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.094" offset="3006055">There are two duties, one to Benazet and one duty to us and they violated both of them.</text>
