            <text syncTime="54.428" offset="291366">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.554" offset="303905">This is an appeal from a decision of the Northern District of Georgia and also a three-judge court which declared portions of the Georgia Abortion Statute unconstitutional that upheld certain procedural requirement and refused in issuing injunction in support of the declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.673" offset="380392">The parties here included Mary Doe, a pregnant woman, a married pregnant woman, doctors, nurses, ministers, social workers and family planning and abortion council organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.427" offset="431383">They found this action as a class action seeking to represent members of their various classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.419" offset="463356">The District Court below found that the right of privacy included the right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy and that the statute which limited the reasons therefore was unduly unrestricted and overly broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.995" offset="517691">The District Court found that Mary Doe and her class was entitled to declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.502" offset="539634">The physicians even though they were found to have standing and other parties were said to have insufficient collision of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.273" offset="570772">This question was brought to this Court also.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.929" offset="585401">This case stands on jurisdictional grounds similar to the Roe versus Wade case which has just been argued except that no plaintiff in this case had pending from the prosecutions outstanding against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.714" offset="648512">It is our position that the jurisdiction of this Court is much like the case in Wisconsin versus Constantineau where that case –-The statute in that case outrighted against the third parties rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.688" offset="736388">The statute in Wisconsin versus Constantineau outright against the third parties rights and sure you would recall that with the posting of the alcoholic case.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.566" offset="779961">The criminal penalty there ran against the bartender who sold alcoholic beverages so that the woman, that posted party would never have an opportunity to assert her right, that was a woman in the case, in the defense of the criminal action against the bartender.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.341" offset="854984">Here we have a like situation of the third parties rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.214" offset="870553">Mary Doe who would never have an opportunity, we say adequately to assert her constitutional rights in the defense of the doctor’s criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.631" offset="916215">Georgia like Texas, it is not a crime for a woman to submit to an abortion or to abort herself.</text>

            <text syncTime="236.026" offset="1017779">Her husband or her paramour could have been charged but to my recollection is not going to charge against the woman as a conspirator.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.462" offset="1099490">The hospital was not thought to be an indispensable party since the hospital abortion committee was a statutory committee created by the statute or the abortion statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.887" offset="1161244">It was our opinion that under the Georgia law dealing with the attorney general in his powers which gave him powers over our board’s committee and commissions as to matters of law that this was sufficient to bring that interest into operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.946" offset="1249433">Also, the abortion committee is a revolving committee and it would involve the various doctors from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.836" offset="1301051">Most hospitals in Georgia have their staff members sit on the abortion committee so that it changes from month to month or from day to day even.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.921" offset="1341384">So that it was felt that bringing the State Attorney General in as a defendant in the case would be sufficient to raise the state statutory abortion committee in the exercise of a statutory authority given to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.998" offset="1425603">Mary Doe was a 22-year-old woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.991" offset="1437619">She was married and pregnant at the time that this action was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.194" offset="1458413">Her reasons for abortion were several.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.122" offset="1478161">She had three previous children.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.164" offset="1486312">Two of whom had been taken from her custody by state authorities because of her inability to care for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.133" offset="1510240">And the third she had placed with adopted parents at birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.377" offset="1531138">She applied to the public hospital for an abortion which she was eligible for free medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.702" offset="1560499">Her application there was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.826" offset="1572934">She later planned through her private physician to a private hospital abortion committee where her abortion application was approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.274" offset="1610759">She did not obtain the abortion, however because she did not have the cash to deposit entire hospital bill in advance.</text>

            <text syncTime="463.242" offset="1926632">Our major contingent here or appeal here is directed primarily at the procedural requirements less standing by the District Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.914" offset="1969368">Our statute does provide that right as a ground for abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.783" offset="1992774">Also, a fetal malformation endangered to the life of the woman or serious and permanent danger to her health.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.991" offset="2021613">These were the reasons that the Court declared unconstitutional however, there were other good reasons –- good and sufficient reasons for an abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.723" offset="2056512">The requirement said unless standing are the residency requirement that the woman’s doctor have at least two consultants who concur on his opinion and approval by hospital abortion committee of at least three more doctors and the accredited licensed hospital provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.597" offset="2128088">This accreditation requirement is by the joint commission on hospital accreditation of Chicago, Illinois Corporation which is a private organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.144" offset="2170197">There are other many reporting requirements and miscellaneous provisions left in the statute but I wish to direct the court’s attention to the hospital abortion committee, the accreditation and residency requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.215" offset="2226517">It is the appellant’s contention that it is not necessary to debate to fetal life problem in this case because if the District Court below recognized, this statute is aimed at protecting the health of women.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.475" offset="2287539">Judge Smith in delivering the opinion of the Court found that the whole thrust of the present Georgia Statute is to treat the problem as a medical one.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.410" offset="2323275">The only compelling state interest however that has been asserted by the state, is the interest in preserving fetal life and then taking this approach to the statute, the state finds itself in a very inconsistent position we feel, that is affirming that fetuses from the moment of conception have the right to develop and be born and yet having abandoned such right as to those fetuses the product of rape or which may like to be malformed or those which may endanger the life or health of the woman.</text>

            <text syncTime="630.989" offset="2597665">Yes, that is one of the exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.534" offset="2607801">I will always model after the Model Penal Code of American Law Institute version.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.763" offset="2636744">The further inconsistency involves the financing of the family planning program which distributes further Department of Public Health, the intrauterine contraceptive device which substantial medical opinion has destroyed the product of conception or prevent implantation of the fertilize egg or embryo.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.450" offset="2723471">We feel that if the state has such an unfettered interest in fetal life, that these are very inconsistent provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.505" offset="2767670">Thus it is our contention that the statute must be viewed as a health of the woman directive purpose statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.255" offset="2802674">I would point out that abortion is not a new medical procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.990" offset="2821587">Of course we have heard a lot about it in the last few years.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.074" offset="2833916">But it is one that has been extensively performed throughout the history of our country and of course illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.514" offset="2867667">Because of the abortion statutes, the great majority of abortion had been performed by unskilled person, those at least equipped to take care of the health problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.099" offset="2910090">Doctors, because it is a crime, have not been performing abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.038" offset="2929838">Abortion Statutes however, had not stopped the abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.608" offset="2948124">They have not served their purpose or they are not reaching the purpose of protecting fetal life.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.366" offset="2971112">The fact is a valid purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.750" offset="2984695">To ascend that these statutes do protect fetal life is to ignore the actual fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.139" offset="3006220">In our brief and in the many amici brief filed in this case, there is extensive citation to statistics about illegal abortion and the admission of patient or septic abortions that is the incomplete abortion in the hospital which show that illegal abortions are being performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.664" offset="3100365">What we are actually talking about is getting abortion out of the illegal arena into the health service arena.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.828" offset="3128996">And this is the purpose of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.032" offset="3173822">I would point out that illegal abortion and the complications there from is the largest single cause of maternal mortality in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.339" offset="3214991">Therefore abortion statute have resulted and one of our notions, largest health problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.506" offset="3251667">It is our contention that the procedural requirements less standing by the Court below had virtually manipulated out of existence the right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy as recognized by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.197" offset="3318436">The decision below characterizes the decision to terminate an unwanted pregnancy as a personal-medical decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.490" offset="3355634">In commenting about the procedural requirement, the hospital abortion committee, the limitation to the accredited hospital, the Court said that the state has an interest in the quality of healthcare to be administered to its citizen.</text>

            <text syncTime="1781.584" offset="7200023">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.954" offset="7217472">The very knot of the argument before this Court and the issue facing this Court is the value which is to be placed on fetal life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.521" offset="7263761">The state in this case takes the position that fetal life is to be protected, that it is a protectable interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.251" offset="7306707">The question is whether there should be no value placed on it so that a woman may, in her own decision and with her own doctor determine without any intervention by the state that she may abort a pregnancy after she has conceived and is carrying a live human fetus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.090" offset="7394060">Or rather on the other hand, the state itself may protect the interest of that fetus in any regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.407" offset="7443275">The Court below determines that the state interest or the state was attempting to go too far in protecting the fetal life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.769" offset="7480787">But that it could protect to some degree because it could prohibit those abortions which were not necessary in the best critical judgment of the physician taking into consideration that not only medical factors but really everything involved in the particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.705" offset="7556437">The woman’s economic position, her family physician, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.034" offset="7577753">But at any rate, the Court did indicate that the state had an interest in protecting fetal life at least to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.493" offset="7619654">Now, if the Court of course said well, you can have an abortion in any event whether it is necessary or not then of course it would be consistent with the argument that is made by the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.911" offset="7673257">However, they said the state does have an opportunity to control those abortions which are not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.126" offset="7702201">They may prohibit them, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.534" offset="7715784">I think a great mistake has been made by that Court and by appellants in saying that the purpose of the statute is single.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.385" offset="7759252">That is there is only a help measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.856" offset="7777120">In the first place it is in the Criminal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.745" offset="7792689">As a separate bill, it was introduced to amend a part of the criminal code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.421" offset="7815363">The original bill or the original statute in 1876 was a criminal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.725" offset="7840545">And it speaks of the unborn child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.769" offset="7852770">It does not speak of a thing or an organism but it speaks of protecting the unborn child and that is at least one of the interests of the state in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.326" offset="7902925">I submit that there are three, if you read the whole statute in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.501" offset="7923614">Number one and the underlying reason is the protection of fetal life from wanting or arbitrary destruction simply upon the convenience or the desire of the woman who is bearing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.318" offset="7974919">Secondly, of course the state is interested in protecting women who are going to undergo a very serious procedure at any stage and that is the abortion procedure and that of course is indicated by the very serious procedure that is set out by not only having her own physician think that she could have one but in getting consultants and also approved by the hospital abortion committee and requirement to be done in the hospital which by the way has certainly been the position of the American Life Association and House of Delegates in 1967 which was just one year prior to the time this statute was enacted and has, in my understanding at least, been in the position of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in their standards and in their latest standard with regard to abortions as I read it and of course this is not before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.070" offset="8193930">And I just make them aside for a moment to say that that is one of the troubles with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.572" offset="8215977">It is facial attack on the constitutionality statute and all the statistics and what the doctors think on one side or on the other and whether the abortions are safer than child birth and so on are not really before any court because they were not introduced into evidence in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.701" offset="8288493">So they are not part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.784" offset="8296747">Now certainly the appellants tried to present evidence and in the only hearing that was held before the Lower Court which nearly lasted about two hours at the most, there was an argument but both sides came prepared to present evidence and of course in order to attack the constitutionality as to its effect or its operation in Georgia or its applicability, I submit that we would need a fuller record and that is an attack on the face of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.445" offset="8439481">It cannot be supported without looking at these further facts unless we can say that the state has no interest whatsoever in protecting fetal life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.082" offset="8485978">And I think that the interest which the fetus has as human fetus in this instance becomes broader as time goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.803" offset="8528924">I think the state has a greater obligation to protect that fetal life today than it did in 1876.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.847" offset="8565077">And for this reason, it is more protectable now than it ever was before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.060" offset="8585871">There are more methods now that can be used to protect them including blood transfusion and surgery while it is still in the womb.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.941" offset="8625472">Now this I think has been brought to the Court’s attention in some degree that has filed by the physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.768" offset="8652744">But at any rate there are more possible ways now for example, the very growth of the science of Fetology which is of course the treatment of the fetus before it is born.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.269" offset="8710736">So, its development, it has been created and its development up to the period of birth is such now than it can be protected by the state and so I think there is a greater duty upon the state to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.434" offset="8775415">Now the question which I think comes here with regard to these exceptions is the balancing of competing interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.316" offset="8818883">The state certainly takes no position that the woman has a constitutional right to abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.864" offset="8841139">We have not been shown where that right emanates from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.746" offset="8856604">If it emanates from the considerations which was given in the Griswold case, I think it is erroneous because in that case, there was not the introduction of another entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.166" offset="8910312">A person has a right to be let alone, certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.375" offset="8923164">But not when another person is involved or another per human entity is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.167" offset="8942285">The same thing with the marriage relationship, here a third entity is involved and the state says you may not indiscriminately dispose off or discontinue the life of that third entity except in various special circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.838" offset="9004979">Now this is where we get to the competing interest and the balancing of the interest which by the way think was a statement in recognition that former Mr. Justice Clark made in his law review article about the state being in the position to balance imputing interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.311" offset="9078958">I would say if you have a fetus growing in the woman on one side and a woman that she does not want it, you got a class of interest there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.532" offset="9111768">Now, the state has taken a position where we are not going to prohibit all abortions because we understand that there are circumstances in which a woman should be able to destroy that fetus because her interest is superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.678" offset="9180418">And there are three broad reasons now that are given in our statute of course which was struck out by the Court below so that we cannot here really argue those although we attempted to bring an appeal here which was denied for lack of jurisdiction and our appeal is awaiting, its further pursuit in the Fifth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2321.727" offset="9360558">Underlying the exceptions or the reasons for the exception in the statute is the broad principle of self-preservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.836" offset="9409041">We recognize that a human being has a right ultimately of self-defense and I think that these exceptions are manifestations of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.415" offset="9447285">We allow a woman to abort a fetus, if it is a product of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.507" offset="9467660">Now that has been construed in our state, it will also include incest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3290.203" offset="13234517">No Mr. Justice Stewart, there were nothing at all as far as those are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.073" offset="13253952">Not even a threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.862" offset="13261162">And I think that is one of the reasons that makes it so different from the Wisconsin versus Constantineau case where there was something actually done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.576" offset="13291987">It was conduct there taken on behalf of the officials of the state in that case the chief of police, I believe it was, which we do not have here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.133" offset="13334201">I would like to point out one other thing though.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.286" offset="13342769">We were mentioning to the Court the purposes of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.249" offset="13354681">I think one of the other purposes of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.624" offset="13364189">I think there are primarily three being to protect fetal life and of course the health of the mother and having to go through this procedure and also to protect doctors who are going to perform therapeutic abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.423" offset="13411314">The procedure is set out and they are protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.859" offset="13421136">And if they stay within those wide protections that are given in statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.552" offset="13439840">The procedure that is given and the District Attorney has no basis on which to refer an indictment against them and of course the burden would be on him to show that the abortion was not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.652" offset="13484248">So I think the statute is also to protect the doctors so that they can operate with regard to therapeutic abortions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3380.289" offset="13594798">One other point I would like to make and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.293" offset="13606814">In another area, the state does recognize fetal life as being human life and that but that is with regard to fetal death certificates which are required to be filed when there is a fetal death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.871" offset="13657178">And that portion of the statute which deals with (Inaudible) arrangements and so on and vital records, the distinction is made between life, birth, and fetal death.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.879" offset="13697198">Life, birth is regarded as situation where a product of conception that whatever stage it occurs is expelled or extracted from a mother’s womb and there is evidence of life which means –- and some examples are given in the statute; voluntary muscle movement or heartbeat or something that indicates breathing or movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.103" offset="13798031">Sone independent activity in that fetal life and that is regarded as a life birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.246" offset="13822690">A fetal death is regarded as that type of extraction where there is no evidence of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.729" offset="13848604">So I think in that instance too, the state carries forward this consistent concept and attitude towards pre-birth children and that they are indeed human life that needs to be recorded and that should be very carefully watched before there is any destruction of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.759" offset="13940659">And I think that in closing, I would like to just say that we looked at a criminal defendant and say before he is going to be condemned, his guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.476" offset="13987575">Now, we look that at an unborn child and say can we now at least limit the destruction of his life to these certain circumstances or see as an innocent human life allowed to be extinguished without any regard whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.435" offset="14063435">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3507.459" offset="14103454">All of the defendants in this case did file motion to dismiss which the Court treated as motion for summary judgment and the judgment of the Court specifies that in page 87 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.703" offset="14152460">We have not designated constitutional basis for our case but I would like to say that we contend that the procedure requirements infringe Due Process and Equal Protection and that the right of privacy as enunciated in Griswold of course is their basic reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.811" offset="14228947">I would commend to the Court the Article of Professor Miens(ph) also which goes into the abortion, common-law of abortion and point out that in Georgia, abortion before quickening was only a misdemeanor beginning in 1876 and prior to that then, it was not crime at all.</text>
