            <text syncTime="29.019" offset="189721">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.957" offset="205499">This is a review of a decision of the Indiana Supreme Court rendered on December 23, 1970, declaring the ordinance involved in this proceeding, unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.829" offset="272999">The petitioner, Evansville-Vanderburgh Airport Authority District, is a regional airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.767" offset="296718">By that I mean, it lies in the Southwestern tip of Indiana and is utilized by not only the residents of Vanderburgh County Indiana, where it is located, but by many people residing outside of the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.247" offset="354710">The district was created by a state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.759" offset="368712">It has both legislative and taxing powers and it was created specifically to operate Dress Regional Airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.766" offset="404761">As I stated, it is a primary airport which serves Illinois, Kentucky as well Southern Indiana residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.902" offset="437257">Approximately, 300,000 people move through this airport per year using commercial aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.524" offset="471739">40% of these users, as shown by the stipulated facts in this cause of Dress Airport reside outside the city</text>
            <text syncTime="109.320" offset="510922">.The yearly operating deficits to which I will elude later in this argument, are supported up until now only by tax levies on Vanderburgh county property owners.</text>

            <text syncTime="147.068" offset="661910">During the course of this appeal, Your Honor and I have pointed this out in the reply brief, the charges which we are attempting to establish by this use and service charge ordinance were accepted from the contract of renewal of all of these lease agreements and therefore the question has been left open pending the outcome of this review.</text>

            <text syncTime="168.183" offset="746442">I take it that the deficit you referred is the failure of the kind of charges that justice Blackmun has referred to to cover the operating expenses of the airport?</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard P. Trockman</label>
            <text syncTime="181.748" offset="800673">I don't think it reflects all airports, Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.672" offset="816346">I feel that some of the larger airports enjoy a very handsome revenue, but it is the type of airport that comes from Midwestern part of the United States such as the small or medium size hub-airports which we represent with a space and perplexed with this financial problem and this is what caused, I might add, the passage of the use and service charge ordinance which I will outline to you.</text>

            <text syncTime="210.946" offset="917492">Is there anything to prevent from raising their landing fees except that it might drive the airlines out?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="howard_p_trockman" startTime="216.915" stopTime="295.275">
            <label>Mr. Howard P. Trockman</label>
            <text syncTime="216.915" offset="941316">There is nothing to prevent the raising of the landing fees, Mr. Chief Justice, but we do know that if the landing fees will raise that this type of raise and the levy would be passed along to the passenger in some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.499" offset="995650">Either the air fares would be increased, or the passengers would be paying for this charge in some manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.751" offset="1028669">It's obvious to me and I think it probably should be to the Court that whatever charges are paid by the airlines are passed along to the ultimate consumer and this of course, is the purpose of the use and service charge ordinance in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.203" offset="1090527">It is designed to be passed along to the consumer on a user basis, not on the basis of a property tax that just effects Vanderburgh county residents many of whom never use the airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.096" offset="1138070">But when we have some 120,000 people residing outside the perimeter of Vanderburgh county using this airport and do not support it directly through any property tax, we feel that a much more equitable and broader base of support should be made and that's the formulation of the user tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.551" offset="1219886">The preamble of the ordinance in question recites the need for revenue to support existing and future facilities at the airport.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard P. Trockman</label>
            <text syncTime="333.969" offset="1409535">The airport district is coterminous in accordance with the statute with the boundary lines of Vanderburgh county.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.890" offset="1441195">So that the ad valorem tax which is levied to support the deficit, to raise the deficit to keep the airport in existence, it's levied only on the Vanderburgh county residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.323" offset="1490932">Now recognizing the need for revenue to support the existing and future facilities, and by the way, I will refer later, to Exhibit D which is the part of the stipulation where the consultant's report requires an estimated expenditure of local funds of $6.9 million of airport improvements.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.632" offset="1572225">The airport board passed this ordinance on February 26, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.662" offset="1596362">It notified the airlines of the passage of this ordinance in advance and notified it that it would become effective on July 1, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.807" offset="1636904">As I stated, it was designed in part to deprave the cost of providing commercial airport facilities for use by commercial aircraft and commercial passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.277" offset="1682775">The ordinance establishes a $1 for enplaning passenger charge and as I said, it is on the passenger, to be collected by the airlines and remitted twice yearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.875" offset="1733139">It applies without distinction whatsoever to whether the passenger travels in interstate or intrastate commerce, each passenger is treated the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.703" offset="1776503">And the fact that these respondent airlines might subsequently refer to the fact that there are 88% more or less people who are traveling outside of the airport to locations beyond the state of Indiana is unimportant and I don't think relevant to the proceeding as long as interstate and intrastate passengers are taxed or charged equally.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.436" offset="1895412">That is correct, Your Honor and you will find a stipulation to the affect that enplaning passenger is by identity the deplaning passenger because most people who start one leg of a journey are either completing a journey which had its origin in Evansville or completing a journey which had its origin in low county other than Evansville.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.064" offset="1989975">So it's our position that by saying enplaning passenger, we are reaching all commercial airline passengers.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.937" offset="2105437">Yes, the stipulation, I believe is a very per stipulation upon which we rely, found at page 53 of the appendix at the bottom, paragraph ten.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.049" offset="2149845">I am sorry that is not the stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.887" offset="2193208">I think it's on 43. Anyway, there are some 146,000 enplaning passengers at Dress Memorial Airport in 1967 and this is pointed out in the stipulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.409" offset="2271366">I cannot find the exact location, this is paragraph 12, page 46 of the appendix Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.328" offset="2298952">And there is a like number or substantially like number of deplaning passengers at the airport for the same period.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.237" offset="2330612">Now for the first time in any use tax statute that's been passed by any state or local municipality, the airlines were allowed by the terms of this ordinance, a 6% deduction for its administrative cost of collecting the passenger enplanement charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.967" offset="2401561">I don't know of any other statute, sales tax, gross income tax, highway use tax statutes, at least I have not found any to the state which gives to the airlines or gives to the motor carrier an allowance for this administrative charge and there are cases of course, which state that no such requirement can be made in the statute, but we have had but we have made such an allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.148" offset="2490273">The ordinance does provide that the proceeds are appropriated for the capital improvements of the airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.329" offset="2519007">Now the question involved in this proceeding is of grave and vital concern of the preservation of state and local governing bodies to provide and improve facilities for use of commerce and to charge reasonably therefore.</text>

            <text syncTime="634.369" offset="2611167">Yes, Your Honor there was a statement to this effect and I am prepared to respond to that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.634" offset="2636245">The use of the facilities of Dress Regional Airport, are enjoyed primarily by the commercial airline passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.463" offset="2667487">The stipulations involved in our Appendix are very replete, with statements to the effect that the existing facilities, at Dress Memorial Airport, Dress Regional Airport, would not be essential except for the required use by intrastate commerce, or by persons traveling in commercial aircraft, and I would like to refer in response to your question, to pages 53, 54 and 55 of the Appendix where these stipulations are shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.621" offset="2796219">At Paragraph 10, found at the bottom of page 53 of the Appendix, the stipulation was and this was agreed to by the airlines that the terminal building itself would not be essential except for the required use by commercial airlines and their passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.535" offset="2867794">And also in reference to the terminal building, most of their facilities constituting the terminal building would likewise not be necessary except for the required use by commercial airlines and their passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.020" offset="2921815">In other words, it would not be required for noncommercial or private aviation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1508.051" offset="6105933">But the actual revenue, the substantial revenue which we derive is through the flowage fee, that's paid by the private commercial or private airline aircraft owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.586" offset="6155984">But we submit that the use and service charge in question is in essence, no different from the federal excise tax of 8% which is levied by the federal government in order to adopt and ask their 50% share of some of the grants and aid for improvements which are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.278" offset="6226828">And it's certainly no different than the charges that are made by the airlines for the use of aircraft because it's all designed and gauged by the use of the facilities given and offered to the passenger for its use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.399" offset="6287327">Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3 of the federal constitution, grants to Congress the power to regulate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.726" offset="6320555">But we contend, and the cases show this, that it does not give it the exclusive power, only the power to regulate it in its entirety if it sees fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.347" offset="6363082">That Congress has not shown fit to preclude the states from any reasonable regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.606" offset="6396101">And as I say the question involved in this proceeding is whether we can require Congress to pay its own way for the use of variable facilities which we are furnished to commerce and secondarily whether the dollar charge is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.709" offset="6456496">In a Braniff airlines case in 1954, the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 was called into question and this Court stated that this Act did not exclude or preempt the states from passing or enacting reasonable regulations and until an act of Congress overrides all conflicting legislation, the states can pass reasonable regulations for the use of its facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.092" offset="6574047">As I stated the Aviation Facilities Act has already made the demands on local government to improve its airport system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.777" offset="6604767">And the act further requires minimum standards that have to be a established by local airports, in order to serve as commercial airports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.711" offset="6640503">In the General Motors case, we feel that this is very pertinent on the subject decided in 1965 and quoted it in our opinion, it is not whether a state, or whether commerce can be taxed, it is how it can be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.920" offset="6709361">Our first significant case, we feel, it was decided on the use of valuable facilities furnished to commerce was back in 1886 in the case of Huse versus Glover.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.286" offset="6754815">This involved the tax for the use of artificially constructed navigational facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.556" offset="6779892">Although I am not going to quote extensively from this case, I think the rationale of this case requires as much today as it did it 1886.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.917" offset="6813329">The Court said, how the highways of a state, whether on land or by water may be best improved is a matter for state determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.681" offset="6852408">And it is not the purpose of the Commerce Clause, the Court goes on to say, to relive those engaged in interstate commerce of their just share of the state tax burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.673" offset="6896398">This Court stated, and it is repeatedly held that the private inconvenience must yield to the public good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.062" offset="6925969">And significantly we say, that the only bridge that needs to be gapped between 1886 and 1972, the date that we argue this case, is the fact that the highways that the runways of our airport and indeed the highways of our airport.</text>
