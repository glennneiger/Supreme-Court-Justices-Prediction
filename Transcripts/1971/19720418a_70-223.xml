            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73734">We'll hear arguments next in 70-223, Central Hardware Co. against the Labor Board.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith E. Mattern</label>
            <text syncTime="50.928" offset="277385">Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.743" offset="288670">We are reserving 10 minutes of our 40 minutes to rebuttal on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.984" offset="309567">This case involves Central Hardware, the petitioner barring a Union organizer from a single retail stores parking lot in Indianapolis back in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.088" offset="378008">The National Labor Relations Board found a Section 8 Unfair Labor Practice Violation for this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.979" offset="417610">We appealed that violation to the Eighth Circuit on the basis that because the employees were reasonably accessible to the Union organizers in many places other than the store's parking lots that this court's rule of National Labor Relation Board v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox controlled and therefore the board's decision should have been reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.276" offset="538818">However, the Eighth Circuit found that because Central had opened its parking lots to the public that these lots had become quasi-public in nature and consequently, this court's rule in Logan Valley applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.665" offset="628366">We feel that the question before this court is basically in the situation involving a union organizer coming on a single retail stores parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.349" offset="691060">Do the rules of Babcock &amp; Wilcox apply, or do the rules of Logan Valley apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="167.280" offset="742782">Especially, in this situation where the organizer comes on that lot, not to picket or do anything except solicit authorization cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.092" offset="798057">We feel there are two main issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.341" offset="811014">The first issue is were these employees accessible to those Union organizers, some place else in Indianapolis besides our parking lots and I will discuss that and how it applies to the Babcock situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.937" offset="877470">We feel the second aspect of this case is, are our parking lots quasi-public in nature, so that they have the right under Logan Valley to come on those lots.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.065" offset="929923">Mr. Aylward my co-counsel, will discuss the quasi-public aspect and why Logan Valley in this case does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.100" offset="966077">Now that as you can probably see from the briefs, the facts are highly disputed as far as the briefs go, but it's our position that these facts are crystal clear as far this record goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.452" offset="1015501">The facts that are in there and we feel that, not only the physical characteristics of these parking lots are critical in this case but we feel that the actual facts involving the Union organizer's activities, both on the lots and their lack of activities away from the lots are very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.827" offset="1116960">There are two stories in the Indianapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.924" offset="1125424">There is one on the East side of town and one on the West side of the town, both on 38th Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.375" offset="1143187">The store on the East side of town is on a five acre tract.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.235" offset="1158652">It's a store that sits on a back side of the tract with all the parking lot out front, face is on the main street here, side street over here.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.608" offset="1196163">On one side of the of the East store's parking lot, there is a car wash.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.112" offset="1218106">It has a six foot cyclone fence around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.224" offset="1230541">On the other side of the East store's parking lot there is what the trial examiner refers to as a truck service station, which is separated from the East store's parking lot by a wide muddy strip, we would like to refer to, as a ditch.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.780" offset="1300758">So as you view the East store parking lot, it's not possible to go from any other parking lot on to Central's lot or to go from Central's lot on to any other parking lot, except there is a one man construction office down the access road.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.147" offset="1378289">Across town is the West store.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.864" offset="1393127">Now the West store looks almost exactly like the East store, again it's about a 5 acre tract.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.987" offset="1413607">It sits on the back part of the parking lot, so that all the parking is out front.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.656" offset="1432310">Again, there is a busy street way out in front and way over at a far end of that parking lot, there is a McDonald hamburger stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.907" offset="1473270">Off to right there are two small commercial buildings, they have their own parking lot between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.563" offset="1507961">There are three or four small businesses in there that are generally we describe as low volume -- not low volume, but don't pull many customers or clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.365" offset="1559161">It's such things as a small loan company, and inlaid carpet shop, and things of that nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.615" offset="2032186">But there is -- in this record there is not one instance of anybody coming on that parking lot who was not a customer, who was not ejected as soon as he was discovered, Union or non-Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.144" offset="2094253">Now, over the West store, even with these two commercial buildings, they are off to the sides, they have their own parking lot, the testimony in the record is that there are never, more than five or six customers in that area, at any one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.087" offset="2170008">Now all of the tracts involved in this case, all of these tracts of ground, the car wash, the McDonalds, all of these have been built by different people, at different times.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.197" offset="2218492">Each maintains its own lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.934" offset="2225388">It repairs its own lot, there is not apparent concert of effort to attract people into this as a shopping centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.627" offset="2276170">Now the organizational campaign itself began on May 21st 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.284" offset="2310861">Now this courts rule in Babcock states that the organizers can come on the parking lots, only if the employees are otherwise so inaccessible.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.975" offset="2365613">That reasonable efforts to communicate with him through the usual channels of communication prove ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.070" offset="2401976">Now, ineffective in this situation doesn't mean that the organizers contacted people to some place and just don't get the authorization cards signed, it means that's ineffective that they can't even get to them because of the location of their homes, in relation to the factory or the place they work.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.707" offset="2488493">Now, with the background of Babcock in mind, I'd like to review how this organizational campaign was actually conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.695" offset="2536454">The campaign started on May 21st, 1968 when 9 or 10 Union organizers descended on to the West Store parking lot with what the Eight Circuit refers to as a Blitz Campaign.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.238" offset="2594655">Now, this campaign was obviously designed to get the maximum number of authorization cards signed in the shortest period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.406" offset="2627256">There is no evidence in the record in this case that there was any other form of preparation for this campaign other than the Union organizers.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.440" offset="2675425">However, a month before the campaign started, the Union had gone to a shop store at the Krueger (ph) company or he came to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.093" offset="2714087">However, they got together.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.371" offset="2723177">He took a leave of absence from the Krueger (ph) company and came to – falsified a job application, came to Central Hardware and got one of the new jobs at our West Store.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.041" offset="2777825">During that whole period of the month, he freely admits that he worked on getting names, addresses, telephone numbers and even job descriptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.827" offset="2813038">Now, in this record there is no evidence of any other form of attempt to contact these employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.571" offset="2847938">There is no phone calls, no letters to their homes, no hand billing, no use of newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.779" offset="2872807">They didn't even invite him down to the Union hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.942" offset="2885450">I've never heard of an organizational campaign that didn't involve, at least inviting them down to the Union hall or to some other meeting place.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.821" offset="2920976">Now, the director of organizing himself testified that home calling and visiting these people at home is the most effective form of organizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.126" offset="2966221">Yet, even though 57% of our employees lived within 5 miles of this store, 74% lived within 10 miles, there the board presented not one instance of home calling by Union organizer.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.471" offset="3043543">I was the only one who presented any evidence of home calling and that's the Union organizer admitted on cross examination that one afternoon, he'd gone out with a list of 50 or 60 people, two months after the campaign started and even if that, he must have gone like a great hunk to do all this in one afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.033" offset="3121806">But even at that he was able to contact 20% of the people on that list.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.276" offset="3146779">Yet home calling wasn't even used for the first two months of the campaign and then only one instance in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.975" offset="3193590">Now, as we've pointed out, in the brief says this, as this campaign progressed on the parking lot, the Union's tactics became progressively so gross that the employees started coming to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.790" offset="3244790">Not a few employees 25,30, a hundred, complaining about the tactics being used out there, the harassment, the threats, to the extent that we had no choice but to invoke a no solicitation rule by organizers on this parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.914" offset="3345310">It's our position that although Babcock was decided back in 1956 that it's still the law now.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.262" offset="3374776">In the recent cases that we have cited in the briefs, the Boards own Monogram Models case.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.661" offset="3400376">Kutshers Hotel and (Inaudible) there involved resorts that were open to the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="957.045" offset="3901822">And that's Logan Valley decision to find that our lots are free standings, single store lots are open to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.265" offset="3938707">Now, this they say, is the crucial issue here, is whether or not Logan Valley applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.621" offset="3964203">I would like to direct the Court's attention to the decision where they say that the basis of their decision is other than mandate of Logan Plaza, we hold the company's--</text>

            <text syncTime="993.407" offset="4047272">Of the mandate of Logan Valley Plaza, we hold the company's non-employee, no solicitation to be overly broad as applied to its parking lots.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.369" offset="4095128">Also, in the brief of the NLRB before the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, quite candidly the board says, it should be noted at the outset to the contrary to the company's assertion neither the trial examiners nor the board rely on the difficulty of access to the employees here as affording an independent basis for the finding that the company's rule was unlawfully broad rather the examiner noted that while the question of whether the employees are otherwise within reasonable reach by the Union had significance?</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.368" offset="4279135">It is not of paramount importance in this case and the case of parking lots, if the parking lot is quasi-public in character.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.691" offset="4324483">So to again the NLRB in it's brief in opposition to our appearance here, they say the only issue here therefore is whether the Board's finding that the company's parking lots were open to the public to such to an extent to render the situation similar to that in Logan Valley is supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.194" offset="4422495">Therefore gentlemen, if we're able to prove that accessibility is important and that there is an alternate means of communicating with these employees, then I think the Board is going to be hard put to say that they have proved inaccessibility and therefore they are entitled to have their judgment affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.234" offset="4506609">It would be the Board's position and it is the Board's position that it makes no difference on alternate means of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.468" offset="4535553">It makes no difference of accessibility and as far as discriminatory application of this rule, it really makes no difference either.</text>

            <text syncTime="1140.400" offset="4635236">And in that case it relied on the quasi-public aspects of Logan Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.794" offset="4660836">It only gave once four line conclusion in our case when they arrived at the decision and that was just a general statement that's unsupported by anything in the transcript or the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.195" offset="4702423">It's just saying that they held and we maintain, that's unsupported by the record that these employees were inaccessible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.597" offset="4736069">Now, it's very important I think for this court to know that it's been the long standing rule in Labor Relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.394" offset="4763236">Going back to the Republic Aviation case that certainly employees themselves in this situation and even inside the the store when they are on nonworking time, they have a right to communicate with one another to find out what their rights are as a far whether or not they should join the Union organization etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.588" offset="4848082">Now as Mr. Mattern had pointed out even after our decision here in the Board case, the Board has gone back again to the Babcock and Wilcox case in situations that are open to the public and Your Honor the (Inaudible) case, and the (Inaudible) Hotel case, those are open to the public and there, the board has come back and said, it's still Babcock &amp; Wilcox, and not your Logan Valley.</text>

            <text syncTime="1266.241" offset="5138668">In that situation, we are going to balance it and say that the employer has to give away and the Union organizers have a right to come on because these people are inaccessible elsewhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="1657.382" offset="6703194">Now in Logan Valley, you had a large complex of Sears and 16 other stores on a single privately owned tract of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.571" offset="6747915">Central's case, we own our own parking lot and we're the only store on that parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.524" offset="6771739">The parameter of Logan Valley was 1.1 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.242" offset="6786681">Now, there is no testimony in the record, how many acres this is but if we take the Lloyd versus Tanner case, that comes after ours here and there is, it was one-and-a-half mile parameter and that was about 50 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.334" offset="6839030">So I would assume that the Logan Valley must be above 40 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.076" offset="6853972">Ours is approximately five acres on both lots.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.413" offset="6875288">There is a system of side walks in Logan Valley Plaza.</text>

            <text syncTime="2880.712" offset="11596555">The Board thought that there was in promulgating a ban which completely prohibited union organizers using the parking lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.717" offset="11676594">The company in imposing that kind of a blanket thing had violated Section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.992" offset="11717659">Now in arriving at that conclusion, the Board and the trial examiner, even more specifically, balanced the detriment to the employees' organizational rights being deprived of using this parking lot facility, as against the impairment of the employers' property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.695" offset="11840434">It found, at least on one way of its finding, that since as in Logan Valley, -- and unlike in Babcock, these were premises that were open to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.832" offset="11920996">The employer had appreciated his property right unlike in Babcock where he had no justifiable claim to right of privacy because he had opened up the parking lot, a parking lot by its nature is full of commotion and movement and that -- and there was no showing that the presence of the organizers there, was disrupting the normal operation of the employer's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.513" offset="12095703">If there were instances of such disruption, the way to check that, is to check the individual instances not to completely ban the activity and the company did filed a charge with respect to that conduct with the Board's General Counsel, who found insufficient evidence to issue warrant, the issuance of a complaint on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.555" offset="12199879">So you have a situation then of property that had been opened up, where the conduct of the Union Organization did not disrupt the normal operation of the business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3990.465" offset="16035491">What do we have here instead of having, as we had in Logan Valley, employees picketing, non-employees picketing at the entrance to the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="4001.637" offset="16080212">Here, we had them on the parking lot asking, talking to employees, seeking to get them to join the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.081" offset="16109992">Suppose these non-employee union representatives, in this case, had done exactly what the Union representatives had done in Logan Valley, namely; they had picketed at the entrance to the store, with a sign saying, “Central Hardware is non-union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.875" offset="16181150">These employees are not receiving Union wages or other benefits,” Retail Clerks Union Local 725.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.981" offset="16213646">That would be exactly Logan Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.061" offset="16225976">In Logan Valley, the distances from the entrance to the parking lot to the store were 350 feet to 400-500 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="4046.744" offset="16260666">Here the distances from the entrance of the parking lot to the entrance of the store is 425 feet to 475 feet at one store, 260 feet to 1,000 feet at another store.</text>

            <text syncTime="4066.542" offset="16339870">You can't get any closer to that entrance whether it's a single store parking lot, or a shopping center parking lot.</text>

            <text syncTime="4176.974" offset="16781548">Secondly, it would be totally artificial to divide this case based on what Section 7 allows and disregard what the First Amendment requires.</text>

            <text syncTime="4795.521" offset="19255762">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.462" offset="19271540">I think the crucial difference here when you talk about First Amendment, you talk about Section 7, I think when you look at Logan Valley and you look at Babcock and Wilcox, you got to say, because what Justice Marshall have to look in finally and that is whether or not the message that to be given in Logan Valley by this picket could effectively be given elsewhere, and in course he said, it couldn't be effectively given, so therefore these people had a First Amendment right, and Justice White, I think you very correctly stated in the last paragraph of the Logan Valley decision, that as far as you know, the National Labor Relations Policy does not require this free speech right, that they have it under Section 7, if they have it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4847.968" offset="19465577">When we get over under Section 7, we have got the Babcock &amp; Wilcox case and the same final issue he asserted and that final question is, can that message be given elsewhere other than coming on this employer's property and gentlemen, I submit that judge Gibson on page 80, 88, 89 and 90 of our appendix was the only one that found the facts and he says, “There are no substantial evidence in the record showing that the employees were inaccessible or that reasonable attempts to communicate with them were ineffective” and he goes on to say, “The second element of Babcock &amp; Wilcox, there is no evidence of any non-employee solicitation being permitted or sanctioned by the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.569" offset="19655958">This finding is drawn from thin air, completely devoid of factual substantiation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.244" offset="19682707">Now gentlemen, I think the Court in Logan Valley went to great lengths to prove the governmental aspects of that Logan Valley shopping center.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.318" offset="19714994">I think it's very important that you saw quite a bit of your opinion to the comparing the physical attributes of that shopping center, but the only thing you didn't find similar to the Marsh v. Alabama, that the Suburb and Mobile was the fact that there in Marsh that people that only town also owned the residences, whereas you didn't find it in Logan Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="4933.107" offset="19806110">So if we are to accept the premise that the Board would have us now find, you don't have to worry about these physical characteristics any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.489" offset="19843621">All you have to find is something like a vague term in hoping that you've invited the public to come on your lots.</text>
            <text syncTime="4948.851" offset="19869117">So you don't have to have all these physical characteristics any longer.</text>
