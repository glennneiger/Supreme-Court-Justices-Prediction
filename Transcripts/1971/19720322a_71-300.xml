            <label>Mr. Andrew W. Estes</label>
            <text syncTime="47.983" offset="265589">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.275" offset="274784">I represent Thomas L. Andrews who used to be a railroad man.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.159" offset="290353">One day Mr. Andrews had an automobile accident, which had nothing to with his employment where he was injured necessitating a medical furlough which he was duly given.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.519" offset="327761">In due time he regained his health and attempted to return to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.609" offset="352107">When he got back, tried to go to work, he found that he was still on medical furlough and even with the doctor' certificate he was not permitted to work, and of course he was not paid either.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.619" offset="392126">The Railroad, of course, in its defensive pleadings contended that he was neither a fish nor a fowl, that he was not employed and he was not discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.588" offset="436012">Mr. Andrews in his complaint, originally in the State Court, then removed to Federal District Court contends that these acts and other acts amount to a common law of wrongful discharge which the state of Georgia recognizes as a common law action.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.199" offset="498497">Now what we have today is really a jurisdictional question and it's to determine whether or not courts have jurisdiction over a common law wrongful discharge action arising out of a discharge of a union railroad employee or whether the employee must, and I use the term exhaust loosely of the moment, exhaust his administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.769" offset="592747">I think I can show later that we no longer have an exhaustion of the administrative remedies, rather it amounts to an election of administrative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.347" offset="627124">The Court has undoubtedly noticed how brief the petitioner's brief is, because we have a very simple contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.214" offset="658575">We rely primarily, almost solely on the Moore versus Central Illinois Railroad Company decided by this Court in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.495" offset="691699">The rationale in that case of course was that a railroad union employee could elect either to pursue his administrative remedies or could sue in the court of law for a common wrongful discharge, and we rely squarely on that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.710" offset="756482">Mr. Moore was fired by the Illinois Central Railroad because he had the audacity to sue them on an FELA case, should understand that as general --</text>

            <text syncTime="185.009" offset="813743">The board could, if he made his election and I don't call that exhaustion, but if he made his election, the board could reinstate him, grant him back pay, and give him his job.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.366" offset="859196">He doesn't want that.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.256" offset="862748">He wants to sue for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.060" offset="873929">This Court has said, by the way, on numerous occasions and I will quote in the Slocum case, a common law statutory action for wrongful discharge differs from any remedy that board has power to provide and does not involve questions of future relations between the railroad and other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.877" offset="945191">Of course, this general philosophy was stated very well by Mr. Justice Blackmun in the Arguelles case which I've cited not, by the way, as authority for this case, but because of the language in that, I would like to get to it a minute.</text>

            <text syncTime="986.163" offset="4018340">These are cases where someone, and by the way the Slocum type case, Mr. Slocum was the Chairman of the railroad union, two unions were in dispute as to who had jurisdiction over certain area of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.786" offset="4064838">The railroad attempted to file in State Court an action for a declaratory judgment to make a determination and of course, they were required to go by the arbitration method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.324" offset="4106948">This was completely distinguished in the Slocum case from the Moore type case where this is an ex-employee who is not involved in rights by the railroad employees, and he is still in the railroad just like their (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.469" offset="4167552">The Walker case is like a Slocum case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.734" offset="4176642">Charlie Maddox's case was a case where Charlie Maddox had been properly laid off and was suing only for severed claim in the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1044.182" offset="4250412">I want to mention it just very briefly because I think that can straighten out some also very unfortunate language that came out of the Roy Walker case, and that was the language that the Court of Appeals in the instant case used, even though they conceded that although the law was on my side nonetheless a ruling against me was this, the overruling act has also held that is about a certain as a season, changing as the season coming from Mr Justice Black in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.074" offset="4353962">Mr. Justice Black, in the Arguelles case made a very strong, very fine statement and I think it reflects the feeling of this Court, the thrust of this Court and its perseverance and continue to try to maintain the courthouse door is open to the public, to the little man, where Mr. Justice Black and this was consideration, by the way Arguelles case was a seaman suing under a statutory right to elect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.109" offset="4474125">The Court says, in Arguelles the legislature clearly preserved his right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.458" offset="4511532">In the Section 301, in which the case has been, Section 301 the legislature has not clearly taken it away, and it would be highly precipitous for this Court or any court, to remove the man's right to litigate a wrongful discharge, a common law action in a court without specific legislative action and no clear reflection of any legislative intent toward that direction in any event.</text>

            <text syncTime="1271.717" offset="5160518">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.803" offset="5176923">I somehow get the feeling that if you argue in favor of a court trial, that means you are for the working man and if you argue in favor of administrative remedies, that means you are for the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.507" offset="5239722">And I don't think that's right and I don't think it is reflected in the Congressional history of this Act, and I don't think it is now the present thinking of labor and the railroad that, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.754" offset="5288727">I submit that the Railway Labor Act was an act sought by both the unions and the owners of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.939" offset="5325403">That in those days in 1926 when the Act came into being, there was a feeling of voluntariness in the eyes of the Congress that they could simply prod one side and the other side by means of the Railway Labor Act and achieve the desired results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.330" offset="5391023">And that is what is done in the area of major disputes, those disputes arising out of giving the contract to start off with, that's where the union has a right to strike when the prodding doesn't work, although the railroad has a right to lock out and that is on a voluntary basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.149" offset="5450268">On the other side of the coin, in minor disputes where you have the interpretation or application of contracts; both the union and the railroad have been in favor of that administrative remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.478" offset="5503558">Now I don't know how the case of Moore ever came to be in view of the legislative history because if you look back in the 1934 Amendments which took place of course shortly after the passage of the Act, when they found that the minor dispute area wasn't working because of the fact that it was voluntary, the union has voluntarily appointed the Board of Adjustment members and the railroad voluntarily appointed their members and neither side would do it, and they found that wasn't working.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.447" offset="5619437">And both the unions and the railroads came back to the Congress and in effect said, it's not working and we have got to do something about the area of minor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.810" offset="5652979">And bear in mind of course that the word minor dispute is a word of art that the framers of the act used not because they thought that the disputes were minor, but to distinguish them from strike issues, they used that word of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.866" offset="5705119">As a matter of fact, when the Amendment was in the committee, it was proposed by the Federal Court in the area of transportation, an office that no longer in existence but he said the existence of mandatory Boards of Adjustment would create nice enough and more consistent in the interpretation and application of contracts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1425.849" offset="5777113">Mr. Major, you will have to watch your notes in relation to the microphone, its a little difficult.</text>

            <text syncTime="1432.323" offset="5803026">And in those committee hearings, a member named George M. Harrison, who probably had as many credentials as a union may have, he was president of the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, Freight Handlers, Express and Station Employees and appeared as chairman of the legislative committee of the Railway Labor Association, he said this in substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.990" offset="5873661">He said, these areas of minor disputes that we are looking at in the form of the compulsory Adjustment Board, they may very well involve a man's seniority, a man's pay for amount of work done, his promotion rights and then I quote him as saying, it may very well concern the separation of the employee from the service, whether or not he has been unjustly discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.325" offset="5987033">So as early as 1934 in the Congressional hearings, the union representatives were talking about mandatory Boards of Adjustment to take care of the disputes between the railroad and the working man over matters of promotions, seniority, rates of pay, including discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.591" offset="6060071">And then this Court came along and decided Moore in-spite of that legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.093" offset="6082118">Even more remarkable is the way in which Moore was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.011" offset="6093717">You understand the Railway Labor Act in exhaustion of administrative remedies was and (Inaudible) in Moore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.583" offset="6116077">It wasn't even briefed by the winning side as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.356" offset="6131124">Moore came upon then novel Erie question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.502" offset="6143663">Moore was in the State Court and it was a statue of limitation questions involved, whether a one-year statute controlled as Moore's contract or the six-year written contract with the Union and it got to this Court on the thinking that the State law controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.557" offset="6203953">As a matter of fact later on in amplifying Moore and distinguishing Moore in the case of Koppal, this Court held, “you must exhaust your administrative remedies in your state if your state requires exhaustive remedies, but you need not if your state does not require the exhaustion of remedies.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.277" offset="6274797">So, you have Moore on one hand and Koppal on the other hand, one of them saying that you had to go the Adjustment Board, the other one saying it didn't depend on the act and the way you happen to be fired, as it were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.421" offset="6315339">However this Court I think has now fully and finally solved the question of whether State law or Federal law applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.854" offset="6345119">I think in the case of Textile Mills versus Lincoln -- Textile Workers versus Lincoln Mills, decided by this Court in 1957 and also the case of International Associates of Machinists against Central Airlines, this Court has once and forever solved the problem by saying that anything under the Railway Labor Act involving minor disputes is controlled by Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.261" offset="6442713">Therefore, when we say that this man who has been discharged doesn't have a remedy that's available to the middle man, as he has expressed, it's contrary to the thinking that the Unions and to the thinking of the framers of the Bill as it came through the Congress and it's contrary really to the thinking of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.968" offset="7113537">With that in mind the Congress in 1966 attempted to remedy the situation on the question of delay and again it is quite remarkable in the committee hearings just what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.233" offset="7170588">In those committee hearings there was days and days of hearings and so there is all kind of material in there, but the remarkable testimony of Mr. Jesse Clark who identified himself as President of Brotherhood of Signalmen on behalf of the Railway Labor Executive Association and its 22 member Union group, testified thusly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.948" offset="7257524">He said if the objectives of speedy, fair and simplified handling and some of contract claims and grievances in this industry are to be achieved, it would be done by reducing to a minimum rather than by expanding the role of the Courts in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.837" offset="7333070">And so there is a Union man himself saying that we, the Union men are the ones that want as well as the Railways do, some way to break this backlog.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.015" offset="7369746">And so in order to break the backlog, they changed the law to provide man for what has been commonly known as Public Law Boards.</text>

            <text syncTime="1924.769" offset="7772763">What happened was when they created these Boards of Adjustment and we attached as part of our brief, a table of the report of the National Mediation Board, which includes the report of the National Railroad Adjustment Board and these divisions are not geographical, they are by trials you understand, the division that Mr. Andrews is in is substantially current.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.429" offset="7875372">You will notice from the table that they have only taken in 69 new cases last year and they disposed off, pardon me, that's wrong, 162 cases and they disposed all 300 cases and they are substantially current.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.718" offset="7932528">So, there is no reason in the world, that Mr. Andrews could not get a very speedy hearing before his division of the Adjustment Board and as to what he can get when he gets there that obviously is one of the key question is can he get the same thing he can get in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.419" offset="7987385">According to law of Georgia it is highly dubious that a man can go into court and sue for wrongful discharge, while at the same time refusing to take back employment that has been proffered to him by his employer because of the fact that he must mitigate his damages and the offer of his job back simply shows that he hadn't any substantive damages in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.251" offset="8074739">And so therefore the only thing that he can get is a money judgment for such amounts of actual lost wages that he has accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.299" offset="8110892">Now that's not true necessarily before the Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.720" offset="8124580">Before the Adjustment Board he can get back pay, he can get seniority adjustments, he can get Attorney's fees in some instances and he can also get a reinstated and if they say he must go back to work then the Railroad must put him back to work and the Railroad doesn't have any choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.187" offset="8190409">So, it may be that they can get more than he can get in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.777" offset="8204828">I don't think it would be erroneous to say that perhaps he can get reinstated by a court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.975" offset="8233563">But, certainly a speedy remedy is readily available for him to just get everything that he can get in a court house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.909" offset="8257282">It is interesting to me that Moore has been perhaps explained rights and laws, accepted – it's -- everything done to it, but nobody has yet either fully affirmed it or fully overruled it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.576" offset="8312035">It seemed to me sort of an embarrassing step child sitting back there and we say that now in view of the history of the Act there is no longer any reason for Moore to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.010" offset="8349756">The fundamental reason of course is that you have an administrative hearing rather than Court hearings in this area, in the Railway Labor area is the fact that in addition to speed that you get uniformity of decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.143" offset="8402314">As it now stands if you can sue on these contracts, these contracts are highly complex, in that they are part written and part customer of the trade as it were.</text>

            <text syncTime="2375.891" offset="9577302">Whereas if the worker must go to the Court house for interpretation of his contract, the Federal judge sitting there on the District level has a very awkward task before him because in Atlanta, Georgia for instance, the only place where the reports of the adjustment board are on file and record, we know is the (Inaudible) of the Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.137" offset="9658282">So, if the federal judge had one of these cases in Atlanta, trying to look for precedent would be almost impossible unless he wants send his clerk over to the railroad office. Last, of course is the question of expertise before these boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.789" offset="9708855">The average man doesn’t get fired just willy-nilly of course there cases of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.454" offset="9731529">This man for instance, is not fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.257" offset="9738739">This man has been on furlough because of medical reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.555" offset="9751904">He is perfectly free to walk back in the railroad office tomorrow and say I demand my job and they said fine, go to the doctor and if he passes you, you are back at work that's what the union contract says, that’s what collective bargaining agreement says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.519" offset="9799761">If the doctor doesn't pass him then he is totally free, if he thinks he has been mistreated of course to go the Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.118" offset="9822122">So, what I am saying is that the question of expertise has something to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.346" offset="9843124">Of course this the man that gets fired for breaking the coupling, the engineer if gets fired for breaking the coupling, that might sound to be a right stringent thing to do to him just to breaking a coupling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.908" offset="9881367">But what the Railroad knows is that you don't get fired for breaking the first couplings, you get fired because you have broken the series of couplings and it's symptomatic of the problem that you will be a bad engineer not because you broke one coupling or if you go through and broke and then blow its whistle, you will get fired for that first time you get fired after accumulation of those kind of offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.078" offset="9962033">And when you speak about (Inaudible) derailers and hydraulic couplings, the average judge doesn't know what you are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.757" offset="10000695">That is something that the member of these board know, they deal with it every day and therefore the worker gets a degree of expertise before these boards that he doesn't find at Court house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.387" offset="10035281">In summary therefore we say that the problem that this Court looked at in the Walker decision has vanished because of the fact that the Congress has amended the act and now a speedy remedy is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.590" offset="10092019">The inequities that this Court looked at in Walker case is gone now because of the fact that the Congress in amending the act in 1966 provided for an appeal by either side instead of the mere de novo appeal which only the railroad could take advantage of as previously the law.</text>
