            <text syncTime="15.723" offset="136515">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.437" offset="155428">I would respectfully ask that five minutes of the time allotted to me for argument be reserved for a rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.321" offset="194925">This case is here on the Commonwealth’s petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.696" offset="220421">The Court of law found that a Massachusetts charging procedure that permitted a grand jury to indict with a fictitious name and permitted a Court thereafter to substitute a true name was in fact violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="73.765" offset="368692">Is that the only issue in the case?</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Irwin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="76.934" offset="381439">That to me is the overriding issue, the Commonwealth takes the position that in addition to the Equal Protection argument, there is also an exhaustion argument, and there is also a question of whether or not a purely state procedural Statute should be the subject matter of the review by way of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.210" offset="470465">But in answer to your question Mr. Chief Justice, I would say that the overriding argument that we want to make and stress upon the Court is the Equal Protection argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.993" offset="509648">The Suffolk County grand jury and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on August 4th 1965, returned a first degree murder indictment charging two people.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.035" offset="569835">They charged, one Donald Landry, which in fact was a true name, and it also charged that a John Doe was also accused, guilty of the murder of one Robert Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.283" offset="650814">The defendant or the respondent here, James J. Connor, was later on August 9th 1965 on a motion under General Laws Chapter 277, Section 19, filed by the prosecutor was named on the Court docket as the true named defendant and the John Doe indictment was changed to read, James J. Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.128" offset="770141">The defendant seasonably objected to that on the ground that he had an absolute constitutional right to be indicted in his own name.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.118" offset="818102">That as far as the record indicates was his sole basis for objection at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.082" offset="849972">That motion was directed to Chief Justice Tauro of the Massachusetts Superior Court, who is presently the Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.603" offset="904097">The Chief Justice was asked under the provisions of General Laws Chapter 277, Section 19 which reads as follows to make the substitution: "If the name of an accused person is unknown to the grand jury, he may be described by a fictitious name or by any other practicable description, with an allegation that his real name is unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.069" offset="1013916">An indictment of the defendant by a fictitious or erroneous name shall not be ground for abatement; but if at any subsequent stage of the proceedings, his true name is discovered, it shall be entered on the record and may be used in the subsequent proceedings, with a reference to the fact that he was indicted by the name or description mentioned in the indictment."</text>

            <text syncTime="543.446" offset="2247418">And it seems to me that the Court below makes a significant argument and puts significant stress on a fact that this type of statute would allow a prosecutor to arbitrarily or for some other unworthy reason substitute the name of a person not otherwise meant to be inserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.359" offset="2343131">The Court in the Gedzium case said, and I think this is significant with reference to the Equal Protection argument, the Court said that the trial justice before he allows a motion under this statute must make “the requisite findings” and also, must make an independent determination that no defendant is injured by such substitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.386" offset="2491193">We have to assume then that the Massachusetts Court itself through its construction of General Laws Chapter 277, Section 19 has imposed upon the Court a burden of finding cause or probable cause that the person, whose name is ought to be substituted for that of John Doe, must be in fact be the one that the grand jury intended.</text>

            <text syncTime="701.912" offset="2881358">So, our argument is that this particular statute, as it has been construed, empowers the Court or the Trial Justice to whom this motion is presented to place himself in the capacity as an agent for the grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1820.422" offset="7355402">In this case involving a homicide that occurred in the early morning hours of May 1st 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.799" offset="7408901">The indictment was handed down by a Grand Jury but that was in session during the entire summer of 1965, and I believe was even in session during May 1965 and throughout August 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.451" offset="7511510">On August 4th of Wednesday, I believe, this particular indictment was handed down and the indictment besides naming a man named Donald Landry, also stated that another man was involved, John Doe and that they had no description of this man and no other man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.330" offset="7654974">And, that is the way the indictment read and I believe it is stated in full on page 74 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.447" offset="7699487">This information was attested under oath by the Grand Jury and signed by the foreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.770" offset="7772734">On August 6th, two days after this so called indictment of John Doe, which is not a fictitious name in my belief under the Massachusetts Statute, in my belief that statute is intended to indicate a man who was known to the police only by a nickname, a part of the name or a fictitious or assumed name.</text>

            <text syncTime="1988.654" offset="8028316">All the Grand Jury did was to indicate that it did not know any way of identifying the second man involved in the homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.503" offset="8083696">Now, on August 6th, Landry’s wife was moving from her apartment in Boston and some friends had gone there to help her.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.235" offset="8130612">Connor and his girlfriend were at that apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.896" offset="8149211">Connor was arrested when the police visited the apartment with another man of about the same description.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.751" offset="8184633">This other man had been in jail on May 1st, so Connor was held and this was in fact stated to Connor by one of the policeman.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.302" offset="8222876">I have made this statement in Open Court and there has never been any denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.185" offset="8254432">Connor was then taken to police head quarters in Boston and thereafter on the 9th of August, the following Monday I, in response to a telephone call on behalf of Connor, went to Suffolk Superior Court for the purpose of representing Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.777" offset="8380760">It was not known at that time when the case was called that I was in the Courtroom, but it was called and I presented myself to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.871" offset="8417123">I have supplied the Court with a copy of that session.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.000" offset="8457665">Shortly after the Court recognized me, the Assistant District Attorney in-charge of the case and Mr. Irwin was not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.816" offset="8492878">The Attorney General’s Offices had nothing to do with this case until it was in the federal Courts, but the Assistant District Attorney presented a motion for an amendment to the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.555" offset="8567901">The only information of evidence or anything of any kind that the Court ever had was a bold statement by the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.620" offset="8624117">Since the indictment has been returned, we and he did not identify who he meant by we, we have ascertained the name of the defendant, we did not know it at the time of indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.464" offset="8675526">Those statements were made as to any other means of identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.686" offset="8696424">I objected to this, although I was taken by surprise and accepted to the allowance of the amendment and went to it in detail stating that there was no indication that Connor was the man intended, to be indicted by the Grand Jury or indeed that they ever intended to indict any specific person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.428" offset="8787330">And the consequently the indictment had no application to Connor what so ever.</text>

            <text syncTime="2206.882" offset="8901224">The procedure in the Gedzium case was in accordance with what the Gedzium case said the statute intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.884" offset="8929227">The procedure in the Gedzium case was that the amendment was not to apply, there was not to be any amendment that the indictment was in effect secret and could not be touched, and this is in accordance with the decision in Commonwealth versus Maher (ph) in Massachusetts which I believe has never been overruled and which states that no amendment can be made to an indictment in an capitol case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.211" offset="9058481">The Gedzium case said that when the true name of the man accused in the indictment under the name of John Doe is discovered, it can be entered in the record and there after the defendant will be referred to by that name and that is what the statute says, which Mr. Irwin has just read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.681" offset="9156388">But, that presupposes that John Doe is actually a fictitious name and that no other practicable description is necessary and I submit that the statute does not mean that, but even if it did it would be unconstitutional, because it would deprive the defendant, not only of Equal Protection, but also of Due Process.</text>

            <text syncTime="3517.731" offset="14144626">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.974" offset="14157583">By way of a rebuttal I would only reiterate that it is the Commonwealth’s position that the constitutional matter before this Court on this hearing is whether or not that the respondent, James J. Connor, was deprived of any constitutional guarantee, especially the Equal Protection of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.083" offset="14245981">With respect to the argument that was made by the respondent, through his counsel, I respectfully suggest that a reading of the Commonwealth v. Doherty case that is cited in the brief, with the dissents will indicate that the Massachusetts Supreme Court was not presented with the constitutional argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.555" offset="14315885">And, that the Justices in deciding that case were concerned solely with determining whether or not Hurtado v. California was still strong enough to support the doctrine of Jones v. Robbins in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and no other issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.910" offset="14385266">And, getting back to the position that the Commonwealth takes in its brief, in its argument, I would respectfully suggest to the Court that this particular vehicle, General Laws Chapter 277, Section 19 is strictly a procedural vehicle, by which a Grand Jury which has a valid interest in seeing to it that they are on occasion, John Doe indictment retained has the power to indict somebody and then, later require a substitution on the “showing of cause.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.901" offset="14505221">It seems to me that in that situation, that if the Court wanted to determine whether or not there had been an Equal Protection violation, that the proper thing to do would be to remand the case to the State of Court -- the appropriate State Court for hearings consistent with those particular claims.</text>
