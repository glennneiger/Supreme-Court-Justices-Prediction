            <text syncTime="54.417" offset="291384">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit to review the decision of that Court, reversing a judgment of conviction of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.224" offset="338614">It presents important questions relating to the manner in which immigration investigators can without infringing on the individual right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment, carry out their statutory of responsibility to determine whether aliens or persons believed to be aliens are lawfully in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.598" offset="432028">The facts were essentially these.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.793" offset="444880">On the morning of November 19, 1968, approximately eight agents of the immigration and Naturalization Service conducted an investigation of employees as a rule on manufacturing company in Chicago, Illinois where it was expected that aliens unlawfully in the United States were working.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.001" offset="533696">Some 15 or 16 aliens were arrested for being in the country in violation of the immigration law, including Juan Miguel Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.260" offset="578731">All were place in Agent’s Automobile and as is customary practice, they were driven to their respective residences to gather their personal belongings.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.974" offset="625543">Upon arriving at Rico’s residence at approximately 8:45 am, Rico and two INS investigators, Jacobs and Beryl, went to the door of his apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.243" offset="678623">Rico knocked and respondent opened the door and admitted the three men.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.094" offset="702029">The Agents identified themselves and explained to respondent in Spanish that Rico had been arrested and that they were there to collect his personal belongings.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.901" offset="745288">No search was made of the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.179" offset="758349">Agent Beryl accompanied Rico into his room, Agent Jacobs remained in the living room with the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.527" offset="791786">Jacob who is an INS investigator is authorized by statute to interrogate without warrant, any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or remain in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.208" offset="854480">He inquired in Spanish as to respondent's citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.788" offset="872870">Respondent replied that he was Mexican and when asked about his alien status, he stated that he was a resident alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.125" offset="906202">Jacobs then asked for proof and respondent produced his Alien Registration receipt card which is the identification card that is issued by the immigration service to all the aliens who have been locally admitted into the country in a permanent resident status.</text>

            <text syncTime="442.275" offset="1842744">The lighting conditions were extremely poor and on this viewing, the Agents found nothing in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.107" offset="1870121">They returned the documents to respondent and then left the apartment with Rico who had by then collected his personal effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.668" offset="1908364">Now, respondent raises no objection to this initial inquiry and the Court of Appeals found that it did not violate respondent's Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.407" offset="1951309">This initial inquiry occurred in what the Court of Appeals characterized as “the normal immigration inquiry situation and that is what permissible, the court concluded, since the card served the non-criminal purpose of an enabling the government to be aware of a number of aliens in the country and their status.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.680" offset="2040439">When the Agents returned with Rico to the car, a third investigator, Agent White, motioned toward another individual approaching them and suggested that he had been acting -- he had acted suspiciously on seeing the Agent and should be questioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="529.197" offset="2190486">He was put in Jacob’s car and given Miranda warning in Spanish by Jacobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.102" offset="2218072">He was asked if he wanted to obtain any personal belongings.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.430" offset="2231446">He stated that he did and indicated that he lived in the same apartment building from which the agent had just emerged with Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.952" offset="2269481">Agents White and Beryl then went with Ortiz.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.430" offset="2287348">Unexpectedly, he led them to the same apartment that was occupied by Rico and respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.069" offset="2317964">Ortiz opened the door with a key and as the three agents -- and as the three men entered, respondent came out of the back room into the living room.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.153" offset="2358297">While Agent White accompanied Ortiz into his room to collect his clothes, Agent Beryl spoke with respondent in the living room.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.141" offset="2398212">He explained to respondent in Spanish that Ortiz was under arrest and was being permitted to collect his clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.265" offset="2430708">Then Agent Beryl thinking that if Ortiz’s card was altered, there was a possibility that respondent's card too was altered and recalling that its earlier inspect -- earlier inspection of respondent’s card had been in the dimly living room.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.471" offset="2511583">He asked to see respondent’s registration card, alien registration receipt card again.</text>

            <text syncTime="2476.971" offset="9981559">In Miranda, the man only gave a statement of complicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.057" offset="10005905">In Miranda he did give evidence of his guilt or his statement leading to evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.180" offset="10026385">In this case it was the whole act was the admission of guilt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2657.338" offset="10703061">Here, we have light years of different between an alien from a different country, on foreign soil, unfamiliar with the laws, unfamiliar with the language dealing with the federal investigator’s experience bi-lingual, knowledgeable on his own home ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.807" offset="10772860">There was no place that was safe from this immigration examination or question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.219" offset="10794594">And somewhere along the line, the Fifth Amendment protects this type of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.724" offset="10812566">We contend that the circumstances here are far more coercive and far more detrimental than those existing in Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.211" offset="10846525">If anything, we would try to draw upon the analogy in Orozco versus Texas indicates that the Fifth Amendment should be applied not in terms of a geographical study but in terms of a right or privacy of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.799" offset="10896890">If there is some zone or right of the individual to be protected and that right to be protected against self incrimination should not depend upon whether he is in a jail house or in his flat.</text>

            <text syncTime="3316.778" offset="13340801">The card here serves as some type of entry document, but the document is a re-entry document.</text>

            <text syncTime="3334.206" offset="13410496">The contention made here is that the statute does not cover this particular card.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.703" offset="13440485">The first one is that entry is distinguishable from re-entry and to the Court we cite the precedent of this Court in (Inaudible) case as interpreted by the McFarland, a Second Circuit’s opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.460" offset="13491476">Second point that we make is the regulatory characterization of the card by the immigration authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.807" offset="13516867">There was a two categorization, registration card and evidence of registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.655" offset="13536302">This card is secured within 30 days after entry into the United States, not at entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.365" offset="13563156">That is our contention that the ambit and scope of 1546 was directed at those who would put forward some type of legal documentation to indicate lawful status in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.086" offset="13614042">That is to say, false birth certificates or other items to give him the aura of legitimacy within the United States that this was not the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.478" offset="13655629">Further it can be easily reviewed by taking a look at the regulatory scheme, as Justice Marshall first defined it early and that is that there is a scheme of removal of those unlawfully in the United States who misconstrue the, so to speak, poem on the Statute of Liberty, who look for a better land as in this case, this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.985" offset="13737654">And that at first is a voluntary return, no deportation necessary, a person can be returned with Government funds or without Government funds to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.681" offset="13768374">Two, deportation, three, unlawful entry under 8 U.S.C. 1325, first offense, $500.00, six months, second offense, two years, $1,000.00, next step will be 9 1326.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.056" offset="13821872">The person who has been deported unlawfully returns, two years, $2,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.877" offset="13845174">Then moving on, to the more serious ones, 1546 and we have the five years and then 1306 (c) and that is the one who counterfeits the alien registration receipt card.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.090" offset="13890000">The further point is that within the statute we have a patent in consideration and that is that in the second paragraph of 1546, there are set forth a statute to deal with the counterfeiting of documents required, for instance, in 1306 of Title VIII (d), there is also a like provision dealing with counterfeiting but this time specifically dealing with alien registration receipt card.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.064" offset="14001908">This counterfeiting provision does not meet our situation where we have only possession, but it is submitted by the defendant that if a specific statute deals with alien registration receipt card as others in the document required for entry and that both of this statutes were enacted as part of the same package legislation, Immigration Nationality Act, therefore, given affect for both statutory sections there is an inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.845" offset="14105040">Applying the principle of legacy , I think the only answer is that that this type of violation and it is treated that way in most ordinary cases even aggravated cases is no more than a misdemeanor under 8 U.S.C. 1325.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.200" offset="14158434">The other arguments contended by respondent in this case dealt with the cert and that was the aggravating statute upon the entry into the premise under the excerpts of the United States, the Fourth Amendment protection is not complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.218" offset="14214545">And that here, there can be no showing that the defendant who consented to this type of interrogation even though the agent might have the right to conduct that interrogation on the street or at their office, their going into his own home, there is no showing of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.055" offset="14281941">They gained access by the use of the other of his other prisoners to pick your clothing that did not give him, the agent the right to conduct this type of criminal inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.589" offset="14320080">The hearsay rule was a statement of Ms. Diana Varga.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.427" offset="14335440">We do not take, so to speak, opposition to the public record exception which the Solicitor General wishes to contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.794" offset="14372847">We contend that if the statement by the selective service file or other public documents made by the public official, they can come in as a traditional exception for the hearsay rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.472" offset="14411613">However, what we do take exception with is, when there is a statement of a witness which is made and then becomes a part of the file and then the file is introduced, not much the whole file, but that statement is introduced and there is no showing of unavailability of the witness, we contend that that denies the right of confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.144" offset="14486219">Further, the question of defense counsel, we were -- I was appointed in this case, I think approximately four days after the two witnesses, the last as to which has been deported back to Mexico beyond the reach of any type of subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.768" offset="14544733">In my motion to dismiss the indictment, I alleged this prejudicial delay because here counsel was unable to effectively prepare this case by interrogating two key witnesses who would have very definite information as to the circumstances surrounding their consent to the INS agents to enter the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.819" offset="14628952">The Government cite, U.S. versus Coleman in the reply brief which I reviewed on the Tuesday, but in reading that case, one can see that it is totally distinguishable because counsel in that case was appointed or re-countered his appearance in August, the man was not deported until the following January.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.847" offset="14697079">In this case, my appointment followed the deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.487" offset="14711603">Two, in the Coleman case their was no showing that the prosecution was aware of the transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.450" offset="14735531">Here, the prosecutor was present in Court when the Court ordered remanded Linda Mendez for the INS for deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.913" offset="14761340">But I say that in this case, it was prejudicial, it was not speculative because it deals as one of the essential issues here in a sense.</text>
