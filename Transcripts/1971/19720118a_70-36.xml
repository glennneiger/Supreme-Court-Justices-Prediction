            <text syncTime="72.945" offset="365456">The respondent, Sindermann was a teacher employed on a year to year contract, which had it's expiration was not renewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.761" offset="420731">Termination did not occur during the contract term.</text>

            <text syncTime="110.527" offset="515816">The President of this college also had about simultaneous with the notification of non-renewal, issued a press release in which he detailed the activities, and as we read in this claim that it had any thing to do with his discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.855" offset="601080">But it is set out in detail, what we considered to be, too precise, valid and legitimate grounds for non-renewal which included one; persistent insubordination and two; a disruption of harmony, among his colleagues, by the way of harassment.</text>

            <text syncTime="284.284" offset="1210778">Simultaneously, with the filing of a suit, he wrote a letter asking for a hearing which was the first indication, or request for an entire period, no hearing was made, the case proceeded under the court--</text>

            <label>Mr. W. O. Shafer</label>
            <text syncTime="302.916" offset="1285384">Well Odessa College does not have a tenure type of statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.832" offset="1317044">Although it has adopted in part and the declaration of policy of the American Association of University Professors.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.364" offset="1359153">And had he requested a hearing instead of placing the matter in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.388" offset="1379216">I have no doubt, that if a hearing would have been provided, but the college, the president of the college got the summons to go to Court on the same day, he got the letter requesting a hearing and of course I am sure it was Perry.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.833" offset="1456956">As far as the college was concerned, and we simply answered in the forum in which he had chosen, not to proceed and, we think that we should not be condemned for answering in court and proceeding then.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.290" offset="1538876">Now, up on motion, the trial court entered a summary judgment of all petitioners on grounds basically that the Sindermann had neither a tenure or a contract, and that his constitutional rights had not been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.800" offset="1632917">Now we'll agree that trial courts could have been somewhat more explicit in its findings, because he made the broad conclusion that his constitutional rights had not been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.229" offset="1690595">We think that it isn’t and haven't, and necessary and not only permissible but inherent in that finding, that he had to find that either one, that no hearing was necessary or that Sindermann waived his right to won, when he resorted to the courts and that valid grounds for non-renewal were established as a matter of law by Sindermann's own pleadings, in the District Court for the Western District.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.886" offset="1829253">Now, it is on those basis that we seek a premise of the Trial Court's judgment, and we think that if we can make our position clear on, the court will concede while we say the case be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.173" offset="1898321">First, about the hearing as I have explained the hearing demand arrived with the summons, but then Sindermann could have asked for hearing, or he could have proceeded in Court -- both remedies were open to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.706" offset="1968538">He chose to do both at the same time and we think knowing that the Court’s action would paralyze any action by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.696" offset="2004482">Now the choice was his.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.007" offset="2013678">He made this election not the college.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.747" offset="2024649">The college responded in the court where he felt it had (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="493.166" offset="2046383">Now we don't think they should be to contempt with it and we think the trial court had a right under those circumstances which were appeared in the pleadings, had a right to say that he had waived his right to a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.485" offset="2119630">Now, probably what is more compelling from a record in this case, is that when you look at the basis on which the case was handled in the trial court, you can see that there is no necessity for a hearing in this case, if the the Board was correct in finding adequate and valid and supporting grounds without dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.929" offset="2253377">Already established the purpose of a hearing is to determine the existence of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.702" offset="2284515">If there is no dispute about the facts, then there is -- it is certainly a useless thing to hold a hearing to determine facts that are already undisputed, and without any controversy in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.446" offset="2347418">In this case Sindermann himself pleaded that he had been insubordinate and that he had violated the directions and instructions of his Dean and his President, on not one but on several occasions and be specifically and in detail on two.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.693" offset="2440414">Now, we think he is bound under the rules of any court by his pleadings upon which he relies as to set forth his cause of action, and when he pleads them thinks himself that, that establishes that fact.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="611.980" offset="2521602">Well let's assume that there were valid grounds for non-renewal revealed in the pleading, that doesn’t necessarily mean that those are the grounds the college used, it could be that they used an invalid ground.</text>

            <text syncTime="636.198" offset="2618464">Yes Your Honor, I am going and I think if I maybe allowed to lay this foundation briefly, I am going to take issues where the proposition that where valid, legitimate, honest, full of grounds for dismissal are established without any dispute in the evidence and without any controversy, that a concurrent plead of impermissible ground is not and should not be controlling or required credit if that is going to reach upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.374" offset="2759212">I am getting to that as fast as I can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.740" offset="2784603">Now I do think it is appropriate here, for me to say that in Jones versus Parker, the Tenth Circuit, the Fourth Circuit in Parker versus the The Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.747" offset="2840610">These cases have held that a non-tenured teacher, in a non-tenured school and in a non-tenured state and college.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.586" offset="2892019">Upon expiration of this contract has no right to a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.213" offset="2910513">The First Circuit I believe in Brown may have joined them in that view but said you ought to have a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.043" offset="2937890">Now we fit squarely under those cases and if those cases have directly declared the law, then our argument is over because we fit under that clause and would be protected under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.818" offset="3012913">But we do not think we are, and we are not here saying that that is enough because we don't have to, and our facts go beyond the holdings in those cases and we say that whether it is contractual or not, is not the point here, we go beyond.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.334" offset="3095042">We think we have adequate grounds under the rule that we propose as being the only possible rule, that the court can adopt and that colleges and boards and regents in this country can live with.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.215" offset="3158572">And in this rule, and this rule that we say we have to have for our survival is that point adequate full and proper grounds, I not talking about the disputed grounds I am not talking about the pretext.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.168" offset="3230357">I am not talking about matters incidental, the length of the hair, the length of the skirts, it might vary from school to school or from place to place.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.438" offset="3271421">I am talking about insubordination.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.673" offset="3284378">I am talking about disruption and harmony among the colleagues incompetence, and inefficiency, basic sound grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.148" offset="3318233">And we say when those have been established the inquiry is over and that if there is a concurrent claim made of impermissible reasons that those failed in the contrast.</text>

            <text syncTime="876.382" offset="3579248">What we say say that he was not free to do, was to leave his duty post contrary to the instructions and directions of the chairman of his department, his Dean and his President and go some 300 to 400 miles away at his convenience and at his choice to lobby in support of that legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.258" offset="3670677">Now, whether the free support of legislation is protected, really we don't think is the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.020" offset="3705785">Here, we think that the critical question is whether he can go 300 or 400 miles away at a time of his choice, contrary to instructions of his superiors and lobby lobby at his convenience in support of legislation in which he is interested.</text>

            <text syncTime="986.389" offset="4019255">That would be a matter of his choice, but this Court has said and if I agree that this is a delicate balance and that the care must be used to preserve that autonomy of the Board to maintain discipline, competency, efficiency and at least an orderly administration of a college.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.081" offset="4117998">The problem Your Honor is to look at your question as to one professor, but suppose on that same, 250 professors or half the faculty also wanted to go and hear the lecture, and also wanted to lobbying at the legislature, then how do you choose each one would have an equal right to go; you couldn’t say one man had a superior constitutional right to go to the legislature and lobby, but what are you going to do, shut down the college?</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.042" offset="4257805">No, you have students who came to get some education, you have professors who have been hired out to teach and this is the point we make Your Honor, when we say that on balance, this is not a matter of choice of the professor to go to a state capital once.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.898" offset="4353309">This perhaps arose some four times and he went on two occasions, testified on the legislation in which he was interested on neither occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.110" offset="4422063">The Fifth Circuit summarily held that this was just a protected right and really did not discuss the matter but we think respondent recognizes the problem quite well, because in a respondent's brief, he classifies it as a grey area, upon which some balancing is needed and when you are in the grey area, if that's what it is, we think the actions of Sindermann himself may well be determining of the importance of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.385" offset="4567199">Now listen, bear in mind that Sindermann himself approached his superiors and requested permission to go, he just didn't leave and go.</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.082" offset="8566024">As a result on both of these issues, the tenure issue and the elevation of the college issue, Sindermann was aligned with groups who were supporting legislature which the college administrators would violently opposed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.252" offset="8618687">Both of these bills came up for hearings in the Texas Legislature within two or three days of each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.876" offset="8641152">Sindermann was invited by the members of the Texas Senate to testify on both.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.238" offset="8662572">He went to his superiors and he said, “May I have permission to go?</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.460" offset="8675529">The only way I can testify, since the legislature only sits during class hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.230" offset="8694546">Is if I can go and get permission to be absent for one day on each occasion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.214" offset="8714504">He offered to pay for the substitutes who would fill in for his classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.156" offset="8734252">The substitutes who were available were people who taught precisely the same courses at other hours in the days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.194" offset="8758494">So, there is no question that they were fully capable of teaching the course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.597" offset="8772078">They had agreed to substitute for him and he was prepared to pay them for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.613" offset="8792140">The college said, “No.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.414" offset="8795274">you can't go.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.188" offset="8802380">And gave him a long elaborate letter from the President of the college explaining why he couldn't go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.466" offset="8823487">The first reason in one sentence was, “We pay you to teach not to go lobbying.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.767" offset="8840727">But then, they went on with, “This isn't your job, you ought to have a legislative man in Austin who can do the testifying for your groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.176" offset="8870402">We were thinking about giving tenure anyway, so there is no reason why you need to go and testify on it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.017" offset="8889733">Quite plain, I think, the college didn't want Mr. Sindermann to be testifying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.681" offset="8912407">He did go, not withstanding their refusal to grant permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.967" offset="8925573">He did provide for substitutes to teach to classes and he did offer to pay for the substitutes himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.982" offset="8953576">Not withstanding that a couple of weeks later, he got advice from the college that he was not to be renewed for the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.473" offset="8991611">When rendering that advice they issued a press release which they furnished a copy off to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.172" offset="9014389">The press release did not say he was guilty of insubordination, it did not say he was guilty of creating disharmony among his fellow colleagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.708" offset="9048453">The press release recited the entire gamut of what we would call his First Amendment activities that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.816" offset="9072904">He got involved in the committee to get tenure and that was unfortunate and it was in opposition to the views of the Board of Regents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.785" offset="9100802">He got involved in the effort to elevate the college and that created a lot of dissension in the community and that was unfortunate and that was an opposition to the position of the Board of Regent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.154" offset="9142285">In support of the latter cause, his name appeared on a “disgusting” ad which appears at the end of our brief and which is quite innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.148" offset="9182304">But his name was attached to a disgusting ad which supported the effort to elevate the the college.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.249" offset="9202680">Though Sindermann had told the Board of Regents that his name had been put their without his permission, he was nevertheless responsible on the theory of guilt by association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.256" offset="9238729">Because he had associated with the group who did publish the ad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.371" offset="9255134">Then at the end of the group, his list of -- what I would call reasons that were being given, they mentioned the two absences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.077" offset="9285958">Then they said, the Board of Trustees has been furnished the Board of Regents has been furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.813" offset="9304871">The above explanation of Mr. Sindermann's activities and has expressed its disapproval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.031" offset="9329844">Indeed on that same day though the press release didn't say, that they voted not to renew him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.574" offset="9347921">Sindermann then came to court, or I should say before he came court immediately from being notified of his non-renewal, he requested a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.955" offset="9377491">He wrote a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.396" offset="9383238">He had when he first had inklings that he was in trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.672" offset="9396404">He had previously requested that he refurnish the procedures with some internal AAUP documents provide for faculty members, those had been refused to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.423" offset="9443320">He was notified of his non-renewal without being afforded a hearing of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.347" offset="9459098">He wrote a letter saying, “ Can I have a hearing?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.226" offset="9470592">He got no answer to that letter and three days later he filed a law suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.712" offset="9488564">Now the law suit, it has been suggested in effect confesses a lack of claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.174" offset="9514373">There is nothing with the the sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.078" offset="9522001">The law suit recites Sindermann's active participation on these two causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.848" offset="9541018">It recites the fact that he was not renewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.375" offset="9551153">It alleges that the reason he was not renewed was that he was taking positions, contrary to that of the Board of Regents on both pieces of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.602" offset="9588038">It attaches the press release, as reflecting precisely what the complaint alleged, namely on its face, the press release and the way it's written and the way it's structured suggest that all of his activities played a part in the decision not to renew him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.331" offset="9650941">The university then moved for summary judgment and it did so on a ground which it is not arguing here today, that it was the ground on which it sought certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.738" offset="9692633">The college said “Since his contract is expired and since he has no tenure, we have no obligation to keep him or to hire him again for another year and we can refuse to hire him for reason whatsoever, including the exercise of his First Amendment rights,” for that proposition they cited the decision of Tenth Circuit which held precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.250" offset="9786673">“It's the only case we've ever found that held that what it did it and they cited that proposition and supported the motions for summary judgment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.582" offset="9816035">The District Court apparently granted summary judgment for precisely that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.962" offset="9833485">Opinion recites 1, 2, 3, 4, he has no tenure, he has no contract, he therefore has no right to reemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.305" offset="9858876">Therefore, the complaint should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.187" offset="9874445">The Court of Appeals of course, reversed that, pointing to the long line of decisions by this court, which established the proposition that a teacher or a public employee or anyone else for that matter can not be denied, even a privilege which the State affords.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.850" offset="9937034">If the reason for his denial was that he has exercised his First Amendment right --</text>

            <text syncTime="3412.665" offset="13724371">And this court has said no, you didn't give him the hearing when he was entitled to and when it would have been meaningful.</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.121" offset="13806187">Our first point stems from the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.943" offset="13817472">This one stems from the procedural Due Process concepts which have been enunciated by this court in a number of recent decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.996" offset="13845684">This court has said that where the state proposes to injure important interests of one of its citizens, it must first afford them a hearing or some form of procedural Due Process, unless the individuals need for or the help that he will derive from the hearing is out waived by the State's interest in summary adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.674" offset="13932411">Now the teacher's interest when he is a teacher like Sindermann, I think are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.299" offset="13950905">When he is denied renewal, number one, it was his sole source of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.872" offset="13965116">This court has many times said what the significance of that is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.544" offset="13979849">Number two, he loses the entire professional relationship that's developed with his colleagues in this campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.323" offset="14006912">Number three, he confronts a problem which is unique I think to teachers, almost invariably if he wants to stay in this career, he has got to move to another city because only college, Odessa Texas, if he is going to teach somewhere else he has got to move.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.881" offset="14061142">That means he has got to sell his house, he has got to move, he has got to buy a new house, make new friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.141" offset="14078278">His entire life is changed as a result of a non-renewal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.188" offset="14094370">And number four the evidence, and we have got it all set out in our brief is very substantial that non-renewal just doesn't mean that you don't teach in this college.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.537" offset="14127807">It means that you don't teach again anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.521" offset="14139718">We are now in a period for the first time in the last two or three years and it's going to continue of a growing teacher surplus in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.317" offset="14170961">Because of the decline in the number of people who were -- the total population of colleges.</text>

            <text syncTime="3581.907" offset="14401256">Now one thing I want to emphasize, the main argument made by the all the parties in Roth is to what's wrong with this process is that it's going to take away the college's discretion which they now have in making decisions and that's because they seem to think that the purpose of this hearing will be a force to college to prove the validity of the reasons that it's assigned for the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.323" offset="14490909">And we want to emphasize that the hearing as we concede is not a hearing in which the college must prove the validity of its reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.535" offset="14523823">The purpose of the hearing is literally what the Due Process clause says, to give the teacher an opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.645" offset="14552244">That is to say the college must tell him in sufficient detail so that he knows what he is responding to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.138" offset="14574187">Why they propose to non-renewal?</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.848" offset="14585054">Having told him that he then is afforded an opportunity to present whatever evidence he thinks will be helpful to his cause to persuade them otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.455" offset="14623506">Now, there is no burden of proof here and no finding to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.489" offset="14639598">The college will ultimately make the decision just as they would it before and wherever they had discretion, they will still have it, but at least he will have the benefit of putting before them those facts and those arguments which he thinks could persuade them to go the other way.</text>
