            <text syncTime="69.253" offset="350725">Wayne Claude Rice was originally arrested on July 2, 1968 for driving under the influence of alcohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.190" offset="394402">On July 19, 1968, he was tried in the Buncombe County Court which was then in existence and received a sentence of a nine-month sentence suspended upon payment of a fine of $100.00 and costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.612" offset="480084">As was his absolute right, he applied for a trial de novo in the Buncombe County Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.641" offset="516237">On August 2, his right to trial de novo was assured and on that day he first pled guilty to twelve offenses of uttering worthless checks and then was tried upon his plea of not guilty on the charge of driving under the influence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3541.715" offset="14240554">I say the great majority of case State Supreme Courts, not Federal Courts, State Supreme Courts which have reexamined this system subsequent to Pearce, have pronounced it absolutely inadequate and I can anticipate no parade of horribles.</text>
