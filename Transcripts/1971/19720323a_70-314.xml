            <text syncTime="468.311" offset="1946937">And it is our position that these cases failed to appreciate what happened in 1897 when Congress passed the first special venue statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.061" offset="1985911">Now, at that time, the Court -- this Court had already decided two cases involving alien defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.849" offset="2029066">The first case was the Hohorst case in 1893.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.571" offset="2047978">And that case involved a German alien in a patent infringement case, and the Court said, “Alien is subject to suit any place”.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.815" offset="2092909">Subsequently, in 1895, Keasbey &amp; Mattison came along, decided by this Court and Keasbey &amp; Mattison confirmed Hohorst, an alien as well as a domestic.</text>

            <text syncTime="530.568" offset="2195936">So, the Act of 1897 was then passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.479" offset="2223626">It is our position that it overruled those cases because Congress, when it passed 1897 Act, was well aware of the decisions of this Court in Hohorst and Keasbey &amp; Mattison for that which they stood.</text>

            <text syncTime="629.586" offset="2592057">But in the Stonite case, the Court does discuss Hohorst and Keasbey, recognizes the situation with respect to Hohorst and Keasbey.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.252" offset="2630718">And then goes on to say that, “We decide that the special venue statute is the only statute controlling,” and it excluded everything before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.263" offset="2678783">Now, I admit, Stonite was still a -- an -- a domestic defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.571" offset="2703965">There was not an alien defendant in Hohorst.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.131" offset="2714205">However, in the Stonite decision which goes into the history rather fully, Hohorst, Keasbey and all the other cases and the lower court cases in the confusion that existed among the lower courts with respect to this question of venue in patent infringement, is examined and the Courts says, “Congress passed the 1897 Act to set the record straight and make it clear that special venue controlled in all infringement cases”.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.542" offset="2823815">Now, the next time that the Court had the question before it was in the Fourco case in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.599" offset="2852132">Now, the specific question presented to the Court in Fourco was whether 1391 (c) which provided that a corporation can be sued in any judicial district in which it is doing business was supplem -- was supplementary to 1400 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="713.702" offset="2928514">Now, at the time that the Court decided Fourco, 1957, the 1948 revision to the Judicial Code had taken place and it was at that time that the subsessions which we are considering and specifically 1391 (d) were added to the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.837" offset="3009075">Now, the -- the approach which the Court took in Fourco was, the holding in Stonite that the special venue statute controls and is exclusive is still good law unless there was some change in the 1948 revision to the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.010" offset="3093712">Again I say that's when Section (c) and (d) were added.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.889" offset="3105206">The Court was specifically considering (c) in Stonite.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.047" offset="3125895">The Court came to the conclusion and it again reviewed the history of the 1948 revision and what had happened before that there had been no intended change in the law and that therefore, 1400 (b) remain controlling as to all defendants in patent infringement cases, and that 1391 (c) should not be read as supplementary to 1400 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="786.467" offset="3219518">The last time that this Court had the question before it was in 1961 and that was in Schnell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.303" offset="3250865">Again, the Court briefly reviewed the history, came to the conclusion as it had in the other two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.336" offset="3279077">It reaffirmed its decisions in Stonite and Fourco, namely that 1400 (b) is the exclusive provision controlling venue in patent infringement.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.978" offset="3325575">And the Court specifically said in Schnell that the attempts to broaden patent venue were contrary -- contrary to the Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.871" offset="3365177">And as far as the Court was concerned, would involve judicial legislation.Now, this point was well understood --</text>

            <text syncTime="873.435" offset="3567469">However, the Court when it wrote Stonite, had Hohorst in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.986" offset="3597666">Now, it's our position that an alien just like a domestic defendant who's involved in a patent case, that this doesn't justify a change in the interpretation of the law which this Court has had for the last 75 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.536" offset="3663808">Now, the principle argument which is urged on this Court and which apparently carried the day before Judge Mansfield was that the revisers note to 1391 (d) -- and it emphasized that in the Fourco case, 1400 (b) had not -- that the -- that this had not been fully appreciated by this Court when it wrote Fourco as by the Coulter case.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.309" offset="3782927">Now, this note says, that the new subsection gives statutory recognition to the weight of authority concerning which there has been a short conflict and then cites two District Court cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.587" offset="3840083">These were both of the Higher District Court which Judge Westenhaver had decided in 1917 and 1918.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.764" offset="3876759">Now, this we submit, is not an indication of a changing the law, because in 1948 when the Judicial Code was revised, 1391 (d) being added, it was merely a codification of the law that generally, and this was the law generally recognize, that an alien could be sued in any district were service could be effected.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.731" offset="3976651">And that's what 1391 (d) stood for.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.551" offset="3991906">That didn't change or modify 1400 (b) which had been in existence in a prior form since 1897 which still controlled in patent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.081" offset="4037986">Now, if it had been the congressional intent, in 1948 when 1391 (d) was to change this well-established law, our submission is that there would have been an appropriate revision obviously in the patent statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.293" offset="4110920">Something would have been said to the effect except as aliens or in some situation such as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.303" offset="4138924">Now, the Court's decision in Stonite that special venue is the sole provision governing in patent case, we say supports the position we have taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.547" offset="4179884">The Court has repeatedly had this before and then several Congress simply said that as far as all defendants in patent cases concerned, they are a special class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.722" offset="4220635">It's our position that if there was going to be a change in the law in 1948, and by the way, the revises to the Code say there wasn't any change in the 1948 revision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.639" offset="4272252">That this was a revision, this was a codification of the law as it stood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.582" offset="4288030">There certainly would have been a more positive, a stronger statement than this rather ambiguous note which was -- and appended to 1391(d).</text>

            <text syncTime="1086.505" offset="4419688">And at that time, it was felt that patent -- defendants in patent cases should not be subject to suit any place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.641" offset="4452288">That there should be a relationship either where they were inhabitants or whether they committed acts of infringement and had a regular established place of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.804" offset="4484889">A practice had grown up after the Hohorst, Keasbey &amp; Mattison cases in which they would be sued all over the place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.936" offset="4513415">And therefore, Congress' reaction to that was the special venue statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1139.631" offset="4632220">I am not urging on the Court that the Congress intended deliberately to exempt any particular type of defendant, let's say such as in (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.024" offset="4689794">I will assume that under 1400 (b) and then under certain circumstances aliens and a certain type of alien and for the purpose of this argument, my client might not be subject to suit in any district because it doesn't qualify under 1400 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.571" offset="4772027">Because the strongest argument the plaintiff of course can make is that there was at the congressional intent that your client not be subject to suit any place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.402" offset="4811315">No, I don't think that was the congressional intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1195.429" offset="4855410">And the fact of course is that the thing that moved Judge Mansfield and certain, other the Courts was to say, “Well, now here are a group of defendants who fend with impunity infringe patents and fend in fringing articles into the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.175" offset="4922388">Well, of course that simply isn't the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.181" offset="4930434">It's is a practical matter, a patent owner can bring suit against persons who makes, uses, or sells.</text>

            <text syncTime="1412.284" offset="5722884">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.622" offset="5744200">I wonder if Congress did not intend the result that the petitioner is suggesting, whether any venue statute at all is required to effect the judicial power of United States as promulgated in the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.508" offset="5819746">What the petitioner is urging is a frustration of the federal judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.267" offset="5850780">Venue, as I understand it in a federal cause of action is intended to direct the geographical area where federal judicial power is to be applied, not if it's going to be applied but where.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.652" offset="5928311">The petitioner is urging the Court to apply a very broad language from the Fourco case out of context and without regard to the legislative and judicial history that upon which both the Fourco in the Stonite cases were based.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.369" offset="6023188">Insofar as alien venue is concerned, I would like to suggest that the patent venue statute as originally promulgated in 1897 was not a restrictive statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.710" offset="6076582">Beginning with the -- the view presented in the Stonite decision and specifically, with two cases cited in the Stonite decision at 315 U.S. 567.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.546" offset="6135932">This cases being the Bowers case, 104 F.887 and the Cheatham Electric case, 191 F.727 at which a detail of the history of the 1897 Act is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.834" offset="6209075">Prior to the first patent venue statute of 1897, there initially was a general venue statute of 1770 -- of 1875 that provider that a defendant in any case can be sued wherever he was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.098" offset="6282114">In the general venue statute of 1887 and 1888, that was modified in cases where the federal courts had concurrent jurisdiction to providing venue over to defendants in which -- in the District in which they were inhabitants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.293" offset="6358914">Now, that's a substantial limitation over where they may be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.100" offset="6378140">But it's important to note that that general venue statute was strictly limited to cases of concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.467" offset="6411577">When this Court reached the subject of alien venue in a patent case in 1893 in the Hohorst decision, it first of all settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.943" offset="6453477">There is no expression in the statutes of 1887 and 1888 that venue -- that -- that that venue statute applies to an alien since there's nothing to indicate that it was congressional intent that that statute so apply to an alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.140" offset="6526306">They concluded that it did not and that an alien could be sued anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.970" offset="6545532">The second holding in that case which is most important is that a federal patent action based on a federal statute, the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction since the statute of 1887 and 1888 was directed to causes where the federal courts had concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.671" offset="6632364">It simply do not apply in a federal patent action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.899" offset="6645320">Therefore, for this certain reason, that statute didn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.834" offset="6660994">The Keasbey-Mattison Supreme Court decision reaffirmed both those points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.582" offset="6680011">It was at that time that the lower circuit courts generally permitted suits against patent infringers without regard whether they were aliens or domestics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.636" offset="6736226">The passage of the first patent venue statute of 1897 was directed toward the second point in Hohorst.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.809" offset="6764961">It was intended according to the Mallory's case to place patent venue on a par with general venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.845" offset="6801115">It first of all provided that in patent infringement cases, venue was to be held where the defendant was an inhabitant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.023" offset="6837790">That is exactly the same as was in the 1887 and 1888 general venue statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.389" offset="6863286">In addition, Congress provided that an alien -- excuse me, that an infringer could be sued at the place he infringed and where he had a regular and established place of business, that as another district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.905" offset="6917307">So to that extend, it is broader than the general venue statutes of 1887 and 1888.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.097" offset="7122107">That it was simply to bring the patent venue on a par with general venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.975" offset="7153559">The -- the first decision is United Shoe Machinery case, it's cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.560" offset="7187936">And subsequent to that is the Sandusky case that is cited by the revisor and is a note to 1391 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.636" offset="7228269">And regarding it for a moment the Sandusky case contrary to the inference to be drawn from the petitioner's reply brief, the Sandusky case is a -- has two decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.981" offset="7277588">There's a two point decision and the first one definitely holds that an alien in a patent infringement action is suable wherever he can be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.459" offset="7319488">It's not dictum, that's a positive holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.101" offset="7342058">At the time of this Court's decision in Stonite, the general rule as applied to venue over aliens was a judicial rule, it was not statutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.030" offset="7405797">These prior lower court decisions, continuing to reapply the Hohorst decision as to patent alien venue are not inconsistent with Stonite's holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.446" offset="7455430">Stonite, even the language of Stonite clearly says that the then patent venue statute, Section 48 of the 1911 Judicial Code that statutory provision is not modified by other provisions or to venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.929" offset="7521363">They're talking about other statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.189" offset="7530453">No consideration was given to the judicial rule of venue, whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.509" offset="7559710">The difficulty is created in this case by the fact that in Fourco, this Court stated that the issue before Fourco was legally indistinguishable from the issue before Stonite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.875" offset="7621150">Between Stonite and Fourco however, 1391 (d) codified the judicial law on alien venue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1897.423" offset="7663364">Therefore, by repeating generally the phraseology of Stonite in Fourco, I think inadvertently, the language became too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.400" offset="7703279">Because then when you talk in terms of statutory provisions not being supplemental law, that does not comply with the previous judicial rule that was codified in 1391 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.788" offset="7768899">The effect of -- of the request by the petitioner is become -- is going to become significantly more important I think in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.645" offset="7832324">The number of recent cases concerned with this problem reflects an economic change in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.672" offset="7860432">More and more, new technologies in whatever form are going to be imported into this country rather than vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.575" offset="7891988">Certainly, there is nothing -- there is nothing objectionable in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.951" offset="7909542">But it's certainly true that is done for for a profit motive and if aliens can see a profit in employing their technologies into this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.664" offset="7948308">And by so doing, violate a federal statute and do it in such an angle that there's a -- got themselves to the -- in pursuant of jurisdiction of federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.061" offset="7981954">It seems to me in Congress that venue wouldn't be so restrictedly interpreted as to ours the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Pierre Kolisch</label>
            <text syncTime="1998.080" offset="8066068">The statement by this Court in Stonite, I think is -- is quite illuminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.956" offset="8089474">It said that the Act of 1897 was adopted to define the exact jurisdiction of the federal courts in actions to enforce patent rights and thus illuminate the uncertainty produced by the conflicting decisions of the applicability of the Act of 1897 as amended to such litigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.910" offset="8169304">Their purpose indicates that Congress did not intend that the Act of 1897 dovetail with the general provisions relating to venue of frivolous suits but rather that it alone should control venue in patent infringement proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.849" offset="8233043">Now, the Court in Stonite was well aware of the situation in Hohorst because it had just gotten through quoting a long footnote.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.433" offset="8271390">And Hohorst was the case which had discussed venue with respect to aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.678" offset="8292393">And there is no argument that prior to 1897, an alien could be sued any place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.681" offset="8320396">And if Hohorst, as far as its holding, is still good law, this alien can be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.030" offset="8345787">But it is our position that Congress, when it enacted 1897, repealed Hohorst to that extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.924" offset="8377343">As far as Hohorst had two holdings, it was talking about aliens and then it was talking also generally about venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.005" offset="8401689">But as far as aliens being subject to suit any place that was repealed by the Act of 1897 and the Court considered it and said, “There wasn't any intention to have any dovetailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.313" offset="8454979">So to me, this indicates that when the Court wrote the Stonite opinion, it ruled that there was a conflict in certain cases, namely patent cases between general venue and special venue and with respect to all defendants not just domestic defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.422" offset="8527390">If there --</text>

            <text syncTime="2124.019" offset="8569813">I -- I say it is significant in view of the suit in the language which was used in Stonite and then used again in Fourco and of course which is the language which gives the respondent here the most trouble because the Court did say this covers all defendants not just certain kinds of defendants, not blue either gray either defendants, it's all defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.483" offset="8659675">And of course all defendants includes aliens as well as domestics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.399" offset="8675244">So the Court had very definitely taken a very strong position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.528" offset="8691857">Now, it could be that there -- and there are, I admit that there are a group of defendants, a certain selected few who may not qualify and may not be sued any place if there is -- then there has been some kind of an over cite or a gap as far as the act of Congress are concerned because the 1897 Act spoke very clearly.</text>
