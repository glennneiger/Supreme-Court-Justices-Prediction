            <label>Mr. E. Freeman Leverett</label>
            <text syncTime="17.097" offset="142096">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.796" offset="152859">The Court granted certiorari in this case to review a decision of the Supreme Court of Georgia holding that the Beneficiary Clause of the Servicemen's Life Insurance Act of 1965 should be construed according to Georgia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.744" offset="212731">And on that basis, the words “child or children” is used in the federal Act, were held to include legitimate children only and to exclude the illegitimate children of a deceased serviceman.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.896" offset="261319">This case commenced with the filing of a suit in the Superior Court of Elbert County, Georgia in July, 1969 against the Prudential Insurance Company of America, the respondent, seeking recovery of the $10,000 proceeds of a policy written under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.760" offset="332790">At the time of filing suit, the petitioner, Lorenzo Willis, was a two-year-old, illegitimate, Negro son of a 15-year-old mother, Janice Willis and a 20-year-old serviceman, Johnny Cleveland Simpson who was killed in Vietnam on September 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.692" offset="412516">The deceased was not married but prior to his death, had orally acknowledged the child as his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.470" offset="439579">He had also signed a statement agreeing to pay the lying-in expenses and he had, prior to his death, contributed to the care and support of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.026" offset="481793">In addition, the paternity of the child had been recognized by the Social Security and Veterans Administrations for the purpose of paying social security and for pension benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.530" offset="531843">At the time of entering the service, the serviceman, the deceased, did not designate a beneficiary by name but simply checked a block on the form which specified that payment is to be made “in the order of precedence set forth in the law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="130.571" offset="596000">The Act in this instance provides that the proceeds shall be paid in this order of precedence, first, to the designated beneficiary, secondly, to the widow or widower, third, the child or children, fourth, parents, fifth, the executor-administrator, sixth, next of kin under the laws of the serviceman's -- of domicile.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.279" offset="678860">Following the death of the deceased in action, his father, offered to assist in securing the benefits for the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.447" offset="719507">And papers were turned over to him for this purpose but instead of securing the benefits for his grandson, the grandfather obtained them for himself, although his application noted that there was an illegitimate son.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.401" offset="771334">This action was then filed on the part and on behalf of the minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.366" offset="791187">Following depositions, requests for admissions, motions for summary judgment were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.600" offset="812085">The Superior Court of Elbert County granted summary judgment on behalf of the petitioner and denied it to the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.663" offset="844372">That Court relied upon lower federal court decisions interpreting the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Act which it held that illegitimate children could take.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.817" offset="892960">At that time the four or five cases interpreting the Servicemen's Life Insurance Act had not been decided or had not been reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.039" offset="929845">The Court of Appeals of Georgia, the intermediate appellate court, affirmed using the same approach to statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.500" offset="959729">But on certiorari, the Supreme Court of Georgia relying upon three prior decisions, two involving the FEGLI and one, decided four months earlier, involving the SGLI, held that the words “child or children” should be construed according to Georgia law as found with respect to wills, contracts, inheritance and deeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.764" offset="1048754">And under these decisions, child or children would include legitimate children only.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.014" offset="1069757">Two Justices dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.538" offset="1079892">I'd like to address some remarks preliminarily to the motion to dismiss in this case on the ground that the writ was improvidently granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.829" offset="1113016">This Court granted certiorari on November the 9th, of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.258" offset="1130779">In early December, Congress passed and on December 15th, the President signed an amendment to the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance Act, H.R. 907 Public Law 92185 which undertakes to define the terms in question here among others.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.323" offset="1202981">With respect to the instant problem, child is defined to include an illegitimate child as to the father only if about six situations are met, first, that the father must have acknowledged to the child in a writing signed by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.469" offset="1267556">Secondly, the father must have been judicially ordered to contribute to the child's support or the father must have been prior to death, judicially declared to be the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.528" offset="1315830">Fourth, proof of paternity be established by a certified copy of a public record of birth or baptism showing that the father was the informant and that he listed himself as father.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.689" offset="1364418">Lastly, proof -- proof of paternity can be established from the service department of a public record showing that the father with his own knowledge was named as father of the child.</text>

            <text syncTime="337.891" offset="1425231">He did -- the father did not acknowledge him as such in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.123" offset="1446233">In the record, there is an -- a statement that he signed at the doctor's office stating that he would be responsible for the lying-in expenses, but he did not acknowledge the child as his, only by and only inferentially as it may arise from that statement.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="359.194" offset="1510495">The problem I have is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.625" offset="1524183">Now, your -- your brother on the other side says -- he tells us that because of the enactment of this -- the legislation of this case is nowhere -- no longer worthy of consideration by this Court on certiorari because congressional statute has now cleared the matter up.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.139" offset="1586250">But putting that point to one side, you tell us that federal law be applicable and hasn't Congress, and by that statute declared what the federal law is.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Freeman Leverett</label>
            <text syncTime="389.203" offset="1630553">They have declared it.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.059" offset="1633897">This does not, of course, affect this case because the language of the statute expressly so declares the amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.984" offset="1661691">Secondly, this does not eliminate the constitutional question that's involved in this case as to equal protection, if that would still be applicable because you still have imposed a burden upon an illegitimate child that is not imposed upon a legitimate child and none of the rationale of Oyama versus California conceding that the parents can be penalized for illegitimate -- or illicit relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.274" offset="1774854">Can Congress itself impose the burden, the onerous procedural burden upon the child where he is not responsible for this situation?</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="435.367" offset="1815187">Well, are you contending then that conceivably, the application of the new act of Congress could be unconstitutional in some circumstances?</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Freeman Leverett</label>
            <text syncTime="443.825" offset="1849042">My contention is, Mr. Justice Rehnquist that the new statute does not cover the facts of this case except it would exclude the child in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.821" offset="1893032">But we also expect to show, I think it is apparent, that the act of Congress really would not cover the great majority of situations arising and likely to arise under the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance Act because of the fact that it's so seldom that there is a formal acknowledgement or that there has been a judicial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.872" offset="1981221">Now, admittedly, the statute purports to say unless it has, illegitimates are excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.612" offset="2000134">It -- it applies to it in that sense but we say that still does not avoid the constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.769" offset="2020823">That resolves the statutory interpretation question but it does not resolve the constitutional question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1184.284" offset="4810805">At the noon recess, I was making reference to a House Committee Report which accompanied a 1970 amendment to the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance Act which raised the coverage from $10,000 to $15,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.971" offset="4869633">And this report made -- express reference was made to the fact that the insurance was designed to provide support for dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.838" offset="4909025">Respondent relies upon certain statements made in the House and the Senate Committee Reports accompanying the 1971 amendment which we have previously discussed to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.627" offset="4956255">The existing law does not define the terms widow, widower, child or parent for SGLI purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.687" offset="4980496">That's presumably leaving such definitions to local state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.591" offset="4996065">This is relied upon in a showing solve a retroactive legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.432" offset="5019471">Now, this statement, we submit, has no particular advocacy in this case because it was not a statement made contemporaneously with passage of the 1965 Act but rather made six years later in connection with an amendment which was aimed at solving the very problem at which this statement was directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.751" offset="5100764">The United Mine Workers case in 330 U.S., the United versus Wise in 370 U.S., this Court held that statements made not contemporaneously with passage of legislation but rather in subsequent years by legislators who were endeavoring to amend that legislature have little or no weight or value as far as interpreting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.541" offset="5199820">Moreover, the statements here made were not independent determinations or statements made by Congress but rather this was simply parroting the language of the letter from the Administrator of Veterans Affairs, who sponsored this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.714" offset="5272545">And in his letter of transmittal, he used the same language which was quoted verbatim in the two committee reports as well as in the -- the statement referred to on the floor of the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.710" offset="5332522">Lastly, this statement which says presumably the question would be referred to state law not only is contrary to the majority of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.794" offset="5368885">There are three lower federal court cases, two of them decided since my brief was filed or at least they were not in the -- they were not annotated at the time our brief was filed, the -- all contrary to the statement made by the administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.241" offset="5434713">And moreover, on its face the statement reflects uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.238" offset="5450700">And in then the DeSylva v. Ballentine case, this Court held that statements are made by an administrative agency which are adopted more from a doubt as to the meaning of the statute rather than from a comfort interpretation of the statute that this would be given little effect because of the fact that the administrative agency itself is an obvious doubt as to the question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1379.811" offset="5592911">And the DeSylva case of course dealt with the Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.847" offset="5605136">And the question there had to do only with the -- the creation of a right, not the devolution of the right it dealt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.104" offset="5694162">And the Court resolved by referring to state law, but on the basis of a determination that this was really a question of inheritance that Congress really intended in the Copyright Act to establish rights of inheritance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.043" offset="5753930">And consequently if you would refer to state law and of course on the California law, the illegititmate could take.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.218" offset="5782560">But here, the question relates to a relationship that is peculiarly federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.136" offset="5802204">And that is the relationship between a serviceman and the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.206" offset="5818504">In every case in which this Court has ever decided a question dealing with a serviceman, it has resolved it solely as a matter of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.147" offset="5854344">We have referred to those cases in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.433" offset="5863435">There are three of them that involved the NSLI Act of 1940 which the National Servicemen's Life Insurance Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.959" offset="5897499">Two of those cases or what would in the Wissner case dealt with the designation of beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.717" offset="5920591">In every one of those cases, this Court resolved the question as a matter of federal law without referring or even mentioning state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.834" offset="5953087">Now, a person does not become a federal instrumentality or agent by writing a book or poem or music.</text>

            <text syncTime="1838.290" offset="7426916">There are however, two points that I would like to make just so I'm certain that the Court understands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.053" offset="7449904">It's not clear from the record before this Court that the petitioner here is in fact the illegitimate son of the deceased serviceman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.501" offset="7483758">As was pointed out, there's no written or public acknowledgement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.697" offset="7500477">There's no father listed on birth certificate and the records of the Social Security Administration and the Veterans Administration do not show that petitioner has been recognized as the son of this deceased serviceman at least so far as this record is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.977" offset="7569649">And we do not contend that he's not the illegitimate son.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.652" offset="7584278">We just want to point out if there is some question of fact on that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1887.608" offset="7624088">Yes, sir, it -- it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.654" offset="7632343">The second point that I wanted to make is -- concerns the question which is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.499" offset="7651673">It's been stated in the briefs I think that the question is the meaning of the word “child or children” in the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.148" offset="7686260">And that is in fact the ultimate question that has to be decided but the specific question before the Court so Prudential contends is whether or not reference should be made to state law to determine the meaning of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.092" offset="7746028">That Prudential does not contend that -- I want to make this clear to the Court that we do not contend that in every situation the word “child” does not include illegitimates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.785" offset="7784898">All we are saying is that reference should be made to state law and then the law of that particular State might or -- or would govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.206" offset="7814573">Of course this was pointed out in California, an illegitimate would be entitled to -- to the proceeds, so we do not contend that -- that that is the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.342" offset="7855115">Now, there are three points that I'd like to try to cover in my argument basically that have been discussed by Mr. Leverett.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.773" offset="7888761">The first point is we contend that the writ of certiorari should be dismissed as having been improvidently granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.320" offset="7918958">As the Court knows, the writ was granted on November 9th, 1971 and approximately a month later, Congress adopted this 1971 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.457" offset="7959500">Now, this amendment speaks directly to the question which is before the Court, the meaning of the word “child children.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.773" offset="7988758">The amendment specifically takes care of that -- of that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.523" offset="8003804">And that question just simply will not come up again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.011" offset="8017701">And Mr. Leverett has raised a point and from some of the questions from the Court, there may be a question of whether that 1971 amendment is constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.222" offset="8054586">We of course would contend that it is constitutional but whether it is or not, that's not a question which is before the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.591" offset="8084052">That question may later come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.605" offset="8092098">And it -- it very easily could, I -- I guess but it's not before the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.148" offset="8110279">The question which is before this Court has been solved -- has been resolved by this 1971 amendment and that question simply will not come up again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.513" offset="8147791">And we've cited in our brief the case of Rice versus Sioux City and it's quoted in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.608" offset="8172137">And it also have several passages quoted from the case and no need to -- to take the Court's time by going in to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.078" offset="8198051">Mr. Leverett mentioned the case of Jones versus Mayer Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.970" offset="8213620">He contends that that case in effect goes against the Rice case and shows that this Court shouldn't go in and consider this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.955" offset="8245489">But in that Jones case, there was a question of the interpretation of Whites under 42 U.S.C. Section 1982 and that concern the refusal of -- to sell a home or rent an apartment on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.605" offset="8308078">And while that case was being considered, Congress adopted the Civil Rights Act of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.556" offset="8331902">And the Court held that it should go ahead and consider the case which was before it because the 1968 Act had no effect on this section which was under consideration by the Court, the 1982 Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.271" offset="8382789">Of course here, Congress -- the -- the Act that Congress has adopted, the 1971 amendment, speaks directly to the question which is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.454" offset="8419569">It defines the very term which this Court is asked to consider in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.313" offset="8442975">For those reasons, we feel that the writ should be dismissed as having been improvidently granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.644" offset="8468261">The second point that we would like to make concerns the question of reference to state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.720" offset="8496578">Obviously, we rely on the case of DeSylva versus Ballentine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.107" offset="8514132">That case of course does involve the Federal Copyright Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.068" offset="8525940">It does not involve an act dealing with servicemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.322" offset="8539001">But we don't feel that that's any distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.025" offset="8549763">Now, petitioner has tried to distinguish the case on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.067" offset="8561989">He says that the Copyright Act deals only with the creation of literary and artistic rights or the passing on of those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.549" offset="8595948">But -- but this Court's opinion at page 582 of that decision pointed out that the evident purpose of this Section 24 which was under consideration in that case is to provide for the office family after his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.567" offset="8647984">The very same question or very same purpose that petitioner contends the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance Act that --</text>

            <text syncTime="2711.052" offset="10917920">In all of those three cases, there were some impediments.</text>

            <text syncTime="2726.755" offset="10980718">There are certain things in each of those situations that -- that could be done but there is some barrier in each of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.186" offset="11006423">In Levy, for example, the tortfeasor could go free if there were no one there to prosecute the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.576" offset="11044039">In Labine, the father could not give the illegitimate his full estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2826.064" offset="11377989">I think that's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.309" offset="11386975">I -- I hesitate and I'm not absolutely certain on that point but I -- I think that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.548" offset="11407873">In any event, he knew about the child before he died, he came home and said he saw the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.795" offset="11424904">He also wrote some letters making reference to the child so he clearly knew about the child and could have made that -- that designation had he wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.290" offset="11470880">So first of all, we -- we contend that this case is a stronger case than any of these other three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.959" offset="11501496">And the next point is that there is a reason for the distinction between legitimates and illegitimates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.311" offset="11526991">And that's really the thing that -- that the Court has looked to and -- and I guess should look to as whether or not there's any reasonable basis for making this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.541" offset="11567847">And obviously as this Court pointed out in the -- in the Labine case, the reason for the distinction is to encourage the family unit to strengthen the family unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.099" offset="11610060">We might disagree and obviously, some people do with the -- the merits of doing this to further the family unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.924" offset="11649453">But that's not the purpose of -- of the Court to try to -- to say, “This is -- this is a bad thing or this is a good thing."</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.648" offset="11680278">The Court held in Labine that this was a decision that the Court -- that -- that or that the individual States could make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.319" offset="11707027">And for that reason, we submit that there is a valid reason, a valid distinction for -- for distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.011" offset="11741718">In closing, I just like to emphasize again that Prudential feels strongly that this is not a case which the Court should decide in view of this 1971 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.563" offset="11783931">We feel that so far as this case is concerned, all of the issues which are before the Court in this case have been solved by that 1971 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.066" offset="11821966">That 1971 amendment may raise some additional problems but those problems are not before the Court in this case.</text>
