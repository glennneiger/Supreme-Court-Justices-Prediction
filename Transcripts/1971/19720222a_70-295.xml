            <text syncTime="27.355" offset="183152">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.508" offset="195691">This case brings up for review a decision by divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.903" offset="237278">The Solicitor General said of that decision that it seriously impairs the power of the executive over the control of foreign affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.474" offset="279596">The case may be stated very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.578" offset="296001">The material facts are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.161" offset="310316">In September 1960, the petitioner First National City Bank owned and operated 11 branches in Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.410" offset="347305">On the night of Friday, September 16, 1960, the Cuban Government seized those branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.009" offset="381787">The instrumentalities at use were its armed militia and the Banco Nacional De Cuba, the respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.705" offset="416478">On the following day, Saturday, there was a radio announcement that the confiscation of American Banks had occurred by reason of executive power resolution number two, issued under Cuban Law 851.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.031" offset="481784">On the opening of business on Monday, September 19, the respondent in this case was in full possession of the petitioner’s foreign branches and it was the respondent that served formal notice of confiscation on a resident Vice President of the petitioner who had been summoned to the petitioner’s former main branch for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.140" offset="582303">On the following day, the petitioner cabled to the respondent referring to the seizure of the branches and stating we have exercise our rights of lien and offset and closed your accounts as of September 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.732" offset="652624">Now, among those accounts was a loan account which had originally been made in 1958, and this was a loan made by this petitioner to the government of Cuba here in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.587" offset="716050">The borrower was a Cuban government instrumentality called Bandes (ph) and collateral for the loan was pledge by another Cuban government instrumentality called Fondo (ph), and a third Cuban government instrumentality, the respondent in this case acted as the fiscal agent for the government in connection with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.581" offset="828063">On September 21 and 22, we are still operating in a five-day compass.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.744" offset="848647">The petitioner sold the collateral that was in New York and after crediting the respondent the amount of principal and interest on the loan, there remain on the petitioner’s books in New York a balance of just about $2 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.937" offset="913431">Two months later in November of 1960, the respondent instituted this lawsuit to in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to recover that balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.864" offset="961183">And as a defense counterclaim and setoff, the petitioner showed that the value of the confiscated branches exceeded the amount claimed by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.191" offset="1002456">I pause here to say that there is no dispute as to this value.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.193" offset="1018443">The parties have stipulated that if the petitioner is lawfully entitled to the offset claim by it, the amount is such that the respondent shall take nothing in this action.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="249.266" offset="1070793">Mr. Harfield, just as a matter of practicality, suppose that the respondent prevails here, what happens to the $2 million?</text>

            <text syncTime="260.858" offset="1117082">I take it that the $2 million would -- you mean in the sense, physically will it be remitted to Cuba?</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="267.595" offset="1144040">Well, does Banco Nacional get the $2 million?</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry Harfield</label>
            <text syncTime="273.542" offset="1167864">Well, I take it that the any recovery by Banco Nacional would be for the benefit of the Cuban Government because Banco Nacional is at least at this point completely integrated into the Cuban monolithic system.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.275" offset="1226796">Now, there is a blocking system that is --</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="293.382" offset="1247276">Just as this is to which my question is directed?</text>

          <turn speaker="henry_harfield" startTime="294.966" stopTime="344.867">
            <label>Mr. Henry Harfield</label>
            <text syncTime="294.966" offset="1253545">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.802" offset="1260860">My understanding is that the -- if judgment were awarded to Banco Nacional to Cuba that the amount of that judgment would be subjected to freezing under executive order.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.184" offset="1318433">That is to say it would he credited to a blocked account, hopefully with the same bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.117" offset="1342153">Until the Government reaches a policy which is has not yet done as to what if anything is going to happen to the blocked Cuban property.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.552" offset="1379873">But I believe it is correct that the amount of that judgment less an allowance of attorney’s fee for the successful plaintiff which I am given to understand this allowed would be frozen, abiding the event ultimately of a disposition of Cuban affairs.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="344.867" offset="1453121">But my next question would be, why is the respondent fighting so hard for it?</text>
            <text syncTime="351.527" offset="1479766">And perhaps, that’s a question I will ask Mr. Rabinowitz rather to you.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="henry_harfield" startTime="356.027" stopTime="535.832">
            <label>Mr. Henry Harfield</label>
            <text syncTime="356.027" offset="1497842">I compare $2 million good reasons why the respondent is fighting hard, I mean why the petitioner is fighting hard for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.988" offset="1525637">Well, let me just continue if I may because the time sequence that I have been perhaps boring you with is, I believe important in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.243" offset="1594704">The case was submitted on cross motions for summary judgment in July of 1961, but was not decided until late June of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.484" offset="1643606">Meanwhile and this was not indolence on the part of the District Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.585" offset="1656040">Meanwhile, the Sabbatino case had been decided by this Court thereafter the Congress had an enacted the Hickenlooper Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act, the Sabbatino litigation had gone back to the Southern District of New York, sub nomine Banco Nacional against Farr and was there decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.520" offset="1735766">And so consistently with its decision in that Farr case, the District Court in this case held that Cuba’s confiscation of American property violated International Law and that the petitioner was entitled to its offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.951" offset="1821552">The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision in the Farr case explicitly holding that the Cuban confiscation where a violation of international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.678" offset="1860422">But reverse the decision in this case on the ground that the Act of State Doctrine precluded it from inquiring into the validity or even the consequences of those same acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.063" offset="1905980">Now at that stage, that the State Department transmitted to this Court its views that important considerations of foreign policy should preclude the application of the Act of State Doctrine to cases like the instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.049" offset="1973898">This Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, remanded the case to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in the light of the views of the department of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.770" offset="2016739">The court below, nevertheless, Judge Hayes dissenting determine to adhere with original decision, this Court granted certiorari on October 12, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.520" offset="2071805">Now, I begin with the proposition that the Act of State Doctrine was not conceived as a device to create an unfair advantage to foreign governments that comes in to our Courts as suitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.013" offset="2133767">In this case, to cut off the petitioner’s legitimate defenses would be manifestly unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.426" offset="2163442">Moreover, the Executive Branch and I am quoting “has made clear its view that application of the Act of State Doctrine would be inimical to significant policy interest of the United States.”</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry Harfield</label>
            <text syncTime="578.206" offset="2386528">I believe that to be exactly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.930" offset="2401470">And the -- I shall indeed at the risk of repeating what you said varies exactly elaborate that fact is as I go on because I think that the extraordinarily position, we find ourselves in this case is that a doctrine which was conceived.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.971" offset="2489555">Chief Justice says, it is between committee between branches as well as between nations, and which clearly was conceived for the benefit of the coordinate branches of our own government is now attempted to be used as a weapon to create divisiveness among the coordinate branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.487" offset="2575655">This is perhaps my judgment, the single most important issue in the case at this particular stage and it goes beyond simply the recognition of the fact that the doctrine conceived in coordinate committee is now be used as a lethal weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.445" offset="2667501">It offends us well.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.045" offset="2673875">Its application in this case would offend as well, the position of the legislative branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.488" offset="2695609">Because clearly, one of the interest of the United States to which the Government -- our Government has referred in its amicus brief here is respect for international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.743" offset="2756631">And our Government has repeatedly emphasized that principle of international law which says that the right of a sovereign to expropriate property is coupled with the obligation to pay for it, to make prompt adequate and effective compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.405" offset="2831341">In this case, Cuba has to fall on that obligation and it’s indebted to this petitioner just as surely as if it had to fallen on a promissory note or a bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.409" offset="2883377">And National City Bank against Republic of China, this Court sustained a defense counterclaim and setoff based on a defaulted obligation of a foreign government that entered our court as a suitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.675" offset="2948370">Now, the respondent has argued that the Republic of China is not an act of state case because the words act of state where not used, and besides and I am quite that it is briefs the respondent has pointed out that a mere default by foreign sovereign may not be sufficient to be regard to be an act of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.434" offset="3043455">But if the Republic of China is not an act of state case, then this is not an act of state case because what we are talking about here is the repudiation of an obligation by a foreign government that they are after comes in here and attempts to seek our law, Mr. Justice Frank Burger said clear of any defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.644" offset="3128301">Don’t listen to those fellows that say they have a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.499" offset="3151707">The Act of State Doctrine was not intended for that purpose, and I pointed out that in the area of committee between nations, the Act of State Doctrine was devised to avoid a friction there which would either because our courts have no power or because they chose not to exercise that the jurisdiction, that might call in question the validity and the effect of acts fully executed by foreign government within its own territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.985" offset="3285663">But, to refuse to apply the Act of State Doctrine in this case does not result in any reversal of any physical act that took place in Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.464" offset="3331534">It doesn’t call in question I think the security of titles and international trade simply because about an offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.785" offset="3360791">And the refusal to apply the doctrine would be consistent with the policy and interest of the United States as declared both by the Legislative and the Executive Branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.677" offset="3408438">The importance of that policy I suggest is underscored by the so called Hickenlooper Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.075" offset="3434038">These adopt as the law of the United States the international law principle of compensation for the taking of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.425" offset="3471446">Moreover, they specified that when there is a violation of international law including but not limited to violation of the principle of compensation, then the Act of State Doctrine shall not be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.138" offset="3526303">In this case, the respondent asserts this Act of State Doctrine as a defense, as a defense against the petitioner’s counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.437" offset="3567472">Now, if the respondent has violated the principles of international law, it is not entitled to assert that defense in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.357" offset="3603103">The Court of Appeals, court below of the Second Circuit reached the same conclusion, the conclusion that Cuban Law 851 was a violation of international law in the Farr case and the briefs that conclusion in a decision which this Court left under stir.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.388" offset="3679276">In this case, even in this case, the court below of the majority did not question the fact that under Cuban Law 851, Cuba was acting in violation of international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.169" offset="3730371">So in view of the fact that Cuba’s confiscations had been held by our courts to be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.142" offset="3762241">The respondent should not be entitled to defend on that ground, the Act of State Doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="966.185" offset="3938411">To begin with that on a record before and then I would contended there was more than adequate evidence, the Banco Nacional had been totally absorb into the Cuban government so that it was indistinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.816" offset="4001000">If it ever had that as a respondent argues and autonomous institution, it loss that autonomy before the events here because as the respondent have said, as Cuba was in the process of changing into a socialist state, it took all the necessarily steps to destroy autonomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.352" offset="4083129">But most importantly in this case, the rule of Banco Nacional has at all times been that of an agent for the Cuban government, and that is why I elaborate it as much as I did at the outset of my remarks that the collateral, the proceeds of which are now in suit was pledge by Fondo which was part of the Cuban government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.952" offset="4185529">The Banco Nacional in handling the proceeds of that loan and in handling the collateral was acting for the Cuban government, and you have a perfect opposition because there is no doubt that if there is a recovery for the respondent here that the sole beneficiary will be the Cuban government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.842" offset="4269016">Unless as Mr. Justice Blackmun says our Government intervenes at some point, but we mustn’t anticipate that I claim is perfect opposition of parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1070.983" offset="4357624">Are claims are eventually filed and then the frozen assets perhaps allocated among those claims that are allowed?</text>

            <text syncTime="1078.767" offset="4388762">Well, I think that there are really is no such thing as a usual procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.727" offset="4408615">In this case, the offset taken by this petitioner occurred three years and this suit was started about three years before there was any government action freezing Cuban assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.630" offset="4464203">So I point out in passing that if this petitioner had not exercise its right of offset, then the response to your question Sir would have been that the money had probably gone down the Cuba and then used to pay Chinese technicians, because the barking did not occur until about three years afterward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.243" offset="4538704">Now at that stage, Cuban assets in this country where frozen but they where not vested it, they where not seized, and thereafter -- after the freezing, a system of claim submission was setup under the Foreign Claim Settlement Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.823" offset="4600980">This was about four years after these transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.984" offset="4613624">This petitioner filed its claim with the Foreign Claim Settlement Commission asserting the taking of its properties in Cuba and of assigning a value to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.973" offset="4661584">It then deducted from the amount it was filing as a claim, the amount of its offset in this case which credited Cuba with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.609" offset="4700141">And the Foreign Claim Settlement Commission has allowed the petitioner’s claim after deducting from the claim, the amount of this offset is on effect, they have regarded the Foreign Claim Settlement Commission has regarded this petitioner as already having recouped to the extent of its county claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1248.788" offset="5068886">It should be regarded very well because as Mr. Justice White is pointed out, our government has not yet decided that it is going to treat Cuba as if it were a bankrupt to state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.932" offset="5113398">But even if it did, all of the learning under the Bankruptcy Act entitles a person who is secured by reason of existing relationships of having collateral, of having liens is in that person is entitled to a preference by law and surely, a secured creditor always has a preference over an unsecured creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.028" offset="5209842">But this is a preference which has been certainly condone if not applauded, and this if you equate this to bankruptcy, then we are exactly in the position of having exercised a setoff which under Section 68 of the Bankruptcy Law is solid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1386.514" offset="5619756">I want to make just one last point on the Act of State Doctrine which is the point that we came here on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.919" offset="5637415">The point of the majority below dealt with, and I suggest that any doubt as to the applicability of the doctrine to this case at this time has been removed by the supervening expression of the executive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.617" offset="5720171">And that is an expression of the executive as to the foreign policy interest of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.964" offset="5741591">Now, the position of the United States in this case is crystal clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.835" offset="5757055">I think there is no dispute at all as to what that position is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.546" offset="5775864">But the respondent would on his brief appear to have this Court believe that the executive is invading the province of the judicial branch and I suggest that precisely the opposite is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.582" offset="5836050">As Judge Hayes said in dissent below, the majority of the court below by applying the Act of State Doctrine after an independent evaluation of the merits of the State Department’s decision is you certain the same executive function which it is the same executive prerogative which it is the function of that doctrine to preserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.243" offset="5922672">The constitutional mandate to the judicial branch is to decide cases and where there is a concern that the judicial branch might transgress on a exclusive province of the executive and the conduct of Foreign Affairs, there is an abstention on the part of the judicial branch and where the executive is silent, then an encroachment is presumed and the judiciary is it tends to abstain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.404" offset="6079302">But here, the Executive has formerly declared that the foreign policy interest of the United States will be furthered to the exercise by this Court of its normal function, the resolution of cases before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.724" offset="6136562">And in the light of that declaration, I would suggest that abstention is not neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.406" offset="6159341">It is as the Solicitor General has said a serious impairment of the power of the executive to control Foreign Affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.034" offset="6193823">Now, the doctrine of separation of power can scarcely be regarded as a requirement of internecine confrontation between coordinate branches of the same government for the benefit of an unfriendly government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.099" offset="6254113">At this point in this case, there is no doubt that application of the Act of State Doctrine will further the foreign policy interest of Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.732" offset="6292670">But I suggest to you that it is inescapably true that it frustrate the foreign policy interest of the United States, and I urge that the doctrine was not applicable to this case, that it should not be applied to this case and that the judgment of the court below should be reverse.</text>

            <text syncTime="1598.931" offset="6469467">And while they are preliminary and accent peripheral issues, at least one of them may be just positive of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.254" offset="6502695">Mr. Justice Blackmun, I don’t know why the respondent is fighting so hard in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.536" offset="6539893">All I know is that I have instructions to fight hard in this and all of the other cases which will involve an increase in the amount of the frozen funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.992" offset="6593705">Now, those funds where frozen by the Executive Branch of the Government, and unless they are unfrozen by the Executive Branch of the Government or perhaps by Congress, they are going to remain frozen and will not go to Cuba and there is no possibility at all of them getting to Cuba short of an action by the Executive Branch or the Legislative Branch, and perhaps that mean shorter from settlement of the general dispute between the United States and Cuba which may it may come at sometime in the future I assume.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.830" offset="6737065">We all hope that someday, it will come.</text>

            <text syncTime="1714.939" offset="6933506">I think that something maybe said in response to Justice Blackmun’s request for commission a little while ago, mainly about what happens to these frozen funds and what I can tell you is not what will happen in the future, but what has happened in the past that happened with respect to the Soviet Union, that happened with respect to Yugoslavia, with respect to Romania, with respect to happened dozen other similar situations that frozen funds will collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.773" offset="7052833">They remained and blocked accounts until one day there was a settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.145" offset="7074254">And those funds would then used to pay for all creditors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.770" offset="7188775">A preference over all other persons who may have claims and whose only logical founders, the only way in which they might possibly someday get some return is through a large frozen fund.</text>

            <text syncTime="1893.067" offset="7645918">So, I will get to that in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.055" offset="7653963">I would also like preliminary to say in response to Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question about this counterclaim matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.928" offset="7693460">We do contend as was suggested that Banco Nacional is an autonomous government agency much as I think we have about 50 autonomous government agencies here in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.660" offset="7740376">No one, I think would content that if the Export Import Bank where to claim against anyone that he would have the right to counterclaim against the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.212" offset="7786561">Even though the funds of the Export Import Bank all come ultimately from the treasury of the United States, even though the Export Import Bank has a board of directors which is controlled exclusively by the United States, event though the United States created it by statute and it is the sole stockholder, nevertheless, it is an autonomous government agency just as Banco Nacional is an autonomous government agency and I think that the record is clear on that, and while I think it is a point which would be dispositive of this case, [Laughing Attempt] I don’t think it’s what we’re here for to discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.971" offset="7941624">I would urge the Court as I have in point five of my brief to decide the case on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.837" offset="7965029">It would be a disposition of the manner in favor of my clients it would avoid all of these other difficult international law problems and of course, my client and I would like it and I hope the Court is so disposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.819" offset="8004944">But if it is not, then obviously, there are other points which are of much greater consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.841" offset="8049039">In the petitioner’s reply brief at page two, he suggests that there are in general too big issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.541" offset="8087909">And if I may reverse the order of those issues and trace them a little less contentiously, I would agree and I would formulate the issues as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.139" offset="8126257">In the circumstances of this case, does the Act of State Doctrine preclude the Court from considering the petitioner’s claim that the respondent acted in violation of international law?</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.727" offset="8168575">That’s the Sabbatino point really, and it’s discussed in points one to four of the respondent’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.782" offset="8196788">And point two, if this is answered in the negative, was the nationalization of petitioner’s property by the Republic of Cuba a violation of international law?</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.878" offset="8241196">And this is treated in points I think six or seven of my brief in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.813" offset="8272961">Now, the Act of State Doctrine has been a part of all law at least since 1897, Underhill against Hernandez and the Supreme Court, this Court in Sabbatino traced the doctrine back to English Presidents running back 300 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.735" offset="8348611">The most recent exposition of course was the Sabbatino Decision in 1964 in which this Court in an eight to one opinion upheld the doctrine and discussed I think most of the reasons for the doctrine in great detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.228" offset="8430636">And I will not repeat the reasons for that decision, the reasons for the Act of State Doctrine because it would involve largely extensive quotations from this Court’s opinion in Sabbatino and I know that the members of the bench are familiar with it and there is no point in my doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.463" offset="8503570">Except to say that I submit that it is a sound doctrine which is designed to keep this Court out of the consideration of the second question, namely was there a violation of international law here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.026" offset="8553829">Not because the second question is hard to decide, this Court gets lots of cases that are hard to decide and not because it’s important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.833" offset="8589042">Because this case -- this Court gets lots of cases that are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.656" offset="8604298">But because it necessarily involves political consideration, political questions which are best left to the Executive Branch of the Government, and I think some of the implications of this will appear in the rest of my argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2192.582" offset="8843998">We do not want the Bernstein Doctrine extended is an embarrassment to our government to extend the Bernstein Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.874" offset="8873150">So we find the Solicitor General of today expressing a contrary opinion and what tomorrow’s Solicitor General for legal advice and to the State Department will say I do not know.</text>

            <text syncTime="2228.676" offset="8988402">It is quite another think to expect this Court to follow in the steps of the administration in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.824" offset="9021003">This Court is not equipped to, is not expected to, and was not intended by the Constitution to be an instrument of the foreign policy of the United States anymore than it is an instrument of the domestic policy of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.026" offset="9089758">This Court is to decide things on the basis of law, and the law -- unless this Court is prepared to reverse Sabbatino, the law is the Sabbatino case, and on the basis of the Sabbatino case, this Court has set and I can think of no better way of saying it than the way Mr. Justice Harlan did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.711" offset="9196546">He said the Act of State Doctrine has constitutional underpinnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.281" offset="9214832">It arises out of the basic relationships between branches of government in a system of separation of powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.546" offset="9243880">It could turn the competency of these similar institutions to make and implement particular kinds of decisions in the area of international relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.141" offset="9290273">The doctrine is formulated and passed decisions expresses the strong sense of the judicial branch that its engagement in the test of passing on the validity of foreign acts of state may hinder rather than further this country’s pursuit of goal both for itself and for the community of nations as a whole in the international sphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.929" offset="9385464">Now, I know that the legal advice to the State Department now disagrees with that and as a matter of fact the next sentence in Mr. Justice Harlan opinion is, many commentators disagree with this view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.873" offset="9445232">I know that they disagree with this view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.337" offset="9455054">One of the persons who disagrees with this view is Mr. Justice White, but the fact is that the Sabbatino Decision discussed all of these and discuss it in considerable detail and came to a conclusion which I submit is as sound today as it was in 1964.</text>

            <text syncTime="2395.317" offset="9654943">The Cuban expropriations here took place in I think 1960, almost immediately, the State Department issued a statement saying these confiscations are violations of international law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2433.289" offset="9806871">And one of the issues that is presented to this Court is where those confiscations violations of international law?</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.431" offset="9847413">Suppose this Court after consideration of the law should be impelled as I would urge it to hold that it was not a violation of international law at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.512" offset="9903733">This Court would then be placed in a position of having to disagree with the State Department on a question on which the State Department has expressed itself not once, but many times.</text>

            <text syncTime="2476.689" offset="9980429">This Court should not be placed in the position where it may be called upon to express opinions on questions of international law which are contrary to the opinions expressed by the Executive Branch in pursuit of its foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.197" offset="10054512">Not this Court’s foreign policy, but the Executive Branches foreign policy because that’s its responsibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="2819.779" offset="11352798">It is as I read it a position that is endorsed by Mr. Justice White or was in his opinion, in his dissenting opinion and it was opposed -- it was opposed most vigorously by Mr. Katzenbach and by the Solicitor General in the last administration, and the court in the Sabbatino case disapproved it, and it disapproved it for reasons that are set forth in the Sabbatino decision and nothing new has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.652" offset="11500337">Except that whereas the last administration has said this is not a business for the Executive Branch for the court at all and we will take care of our own foreign policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3026.369" offset="12179207">It’s his own situation and this is exactly I mean, this is not my idea, this is exactly, it is not only my idea, this is exactly what the Solicitor General said in the brief he submitted in Sabbatino.</text>

            <text syncTime="3050.048" offset="12273875">It ought not be extended at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.784" offset="12284847">It arose at the very unusual facts which are not duplicated here and this Court, the Supreme Court has been the past on it in effect let’s -- let it rest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3065.103" offset="12334061">And as I read the Sabbatino opinion, that’s what the Sabbatino court said also.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.486" offset="12359661">It said Bernstein ought to not to be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.276" offset="12374812">It happened at long time ago, leave it alone, it gives us no lessons for a different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.067" offset="12405950">So that while I think the Sabbatino case is not inconsistent with Bernstein, at least it says leave Bernstein alone, don’t extend it any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.646" offset="12452239">If this Court for one reason or another decides that it will go into the question of the legality of the Cuban expropriations that of course is the question that on the Sabbatino, we should not be discussing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.629" offset="12528203">I have attempted in my brief to discuss the nature of international law and what the practice of nations has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.303" offset="12574910">International law is supposed to be the practice of nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.956" offset="12589539">Not the practice of the United States and Great Britain, but the practice of all nations including the Soviet Union and Indonesia and China and of the whole entity that we in general terms now called Third World or the developing nations or as Mr. Justice Harlan said the capital importing nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.739" offset="12684624">And I have attempted in an appendix to do a job which I hope was as good as I could do in with the facilities I had to show that the practice of nations is by no means clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.615" offset="12752125">And again, this was not my thought because that’s what this Court again said in Sabbatino that there is great doubt about whether an expropriation under these circumstances is a violation of international law because there is great doubt as to what is the practice of nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.916" offset="12837389">Not the morality?</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.813" offset="13100912">But the Court of Appeals if the opinion will be read carefully, the Court of Appeals and I really think this was wrong [Laughter Attempt] Your Honor, the Court of Appeals in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.236" offset="13142603">The Court of Appeals found it discriminatory and it said, sure they confiscated not only American property, but Cuban property as well, but there was a difference of two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.494" offset="13187638">And those two weeks where the -- three weeks or a month perhaps, but it was a difference of a few weeks in time, and those few weeks where critical because that what the time of the sugar harvest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3319.727" offset="13352628">Now, as I say, the -- we are not here discussing the morality of the nationalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.350" offset="13387109">The result of any review of the cases of the facts will show enormous diversity and while it is true that there have been settlement reached and compensation paid in many of these cases, never, never has it been the result of a judicial ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.572" offset="13476030">Never has it been because some courts said this and or that is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.788" offset="13492853">It has been the result of the way we settle international disputes in this world by diplomatic negotiation, and not by judicial interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.938" offset="13545411">The suggestion and the reason for the State Department’s letter in this case is that they want -- the State Department wants to protect foreign investments abroad and if I may just have one minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.609" offset="13596089">I think the Sabbatino court answered that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.105" offset="13610091">If a foreign developing country is prepared to risk breach of diplomatic relations, freezing of assets, embargo on trade, embargo on travel, end of all aid and a host of other sanctions that the Executive Branch can make, it seems to me most unlikely, that it is going to be upset by the fact that a court sometime 10 years hence, is going to say that in addition, the expropriation was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.198" offset="13734538">The sanctions have been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.342" offset="13743106">Cuba will not get the money as I pointed out a moment ago and that forth to take care of that in terms of the policy of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3433.416" offset="13807367">I would like to begin just by without attempting to argue these points to indicate that at page 15 of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.446" offset="13859508">We pointed out that on October 13, 1960, and that date is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.518" offset="13891795">This was between the time that the Cuban government had confiscated the bank’s property in Cuba and after the bank had asserted its right of offset which I mentioned to you within a matter of days or so that following that -- but before the action was commenced, the Cuban government dissolved Fondo which had been the owner of this collateral if pledge and as we point out as I say at page 15 of the reply brief transferred the rights of Fondo in the collateral to this respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.606" offset="14032125">Then when that had been done, they started the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.324" offset="14067024">I don’t want to dwell too much on the question of the autonomy of this respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.937" offset="14097431">I think and I made this point back in the District Court there is some 11 years ago, there is pretty good president on this which goes back to Genesis and says the voice is Jacob’s voice but the hands of the hands of Esau, and I think that that is applicable in respect to the relationship and the transactional relationship between the Government of Cuba and this respondent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3531.199" offset="14198473">Mr. Rabinowitz said you did not want to get into discussing his plans foreign policy and I don’t assume banks in Cuba have foreign policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.006" offset="14229715">So I don’t think we need to dwell much on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3544.889" offset="14253225">As to the question of the argument about windfall, I would refer the Court with respect to page 10 of our reply brief where we’ve done the best we can to deal with that argument and I won’t press this further on your time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.001" offset="14317695">I want to close simply by knowing what is really not my job to do and that is talk about the fact that there is a great deal of more that is happened since the Sabbatino case then a change of administration, and a great deal more in respect of what our Government has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.882" offset="14401183">This Court will surely be aware that in the Sabbatino case, the Government made no expression whatsoever, and protested against a misconstruction of what had been alleged to be its statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.134" offset="14462205">Here, it has done what it set out to do and is I submit entirely consistent in its position as to its function and its duty with respect to the foreign policy of the United States and with suggestions to a coordinate branch when it becomes appropriate to do so, and I think that the department is been perfectly consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.286" offset="14550812">Now, let me close on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.158" offset="14570352">The argument that has been made here comes on two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.412" offset="14595325">One of them is that this Court should apply the Act of State Doctrine whether or not it was otherwise applicable because its coordinate branches of government requested not to do so, and that unless the court does this extraordinary thing, it is going to find itself in the position where it has to make a decision as to international law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.666" offset="14688321">Well, this is the function of the court as was recognized by like Mr. Justice Harlan in Sabbatino.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.929" offset="14709428">It’s one of the many functions, and the suggestion that the Court must shy away from a decision of international law seems to me perfectly absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.201" offset="14770554">Turning then to the question of what is the international law on this issue, and again, I don’t want to burden the Court, but we have a history that goes back as far as there’s any record of Government policy and of acceptance by the judicial branch, the proposition that when a foreign government takes somebody’s property, particularly if it is property for the American, there is an implied obligation to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.824" offset="14881000">That to recognize that obligation does not involved characterizing the foreign government as being a thief or a villain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.900" offset="14921333">This does not really call in question of validity, but to the extent that the validity can be called in question as I suggest, it already had been under a case which Mr. Rabinowitz agrees that he can look for amendment applies to as in the Farr case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.313" offset="14990923">There can be no doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="3748.124" offset="15066156">Here as I have said, the value is stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.901" offset="15077336">The motives may be taken into consideration where there is discrimination as I believe the finding has been so far of the courts in the United States.</text>
