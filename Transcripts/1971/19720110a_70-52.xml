            <text syncTime="36.382" offset="219194">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.506" offset="231733">This Federal Income Tax case is hereon writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.918" offset="257333">It raises the question whether farmer cooperative associations like the respondents which are required to purchase the Class C stock of the New Orleans Bank of Cooperatives as a condition to borrowing from the bank may deduct the cost of such stock as interest expense or as an ordinary necessary business expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.910" offset="345313">In New Orleans, Bank for Cooperatives is one of 12 regional banks which together with the Central Bank here in Washington were created by Congress in 1933 to furnish credit to farmer cooperatives at the lowest possible cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.430" offset="415426">The bank’s original capital was furnished by the United States but under a Congressional plan embodied in the Farm Credit Act of 1955, the government capital was to be replaced gradually by capital belonging to member-borrowers which would purchase Class C stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.976" offset="493584">The ultimate goal of the statute was complete borrower ownership of the banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.594" offset="516049">The banks' authorize capital consists of three classes of stock, A, B, and C, each with a par value of a $100.00 a share.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.991" offset="553666">Class A stock represents the government’s initial contribution to capital is nonvoting, pays no dividend and is to be retired at par with the retirement proceeds coming from borrower contributions to capital and the banks’ earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.232" offset="618658">Class B stock is intended for sale to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.239" offset="630675">It is issued at par, is nonvoting and may pay a noncumulative dividend not to exceed 4% a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.214" offset="662544">After all, Class A stock has been retired; Class B stock may then be retired at par, the oldest Class B stock to be retired first.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.678" offset="700369">Class C stock is the voting common stock of the banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.271" offset="714789">It may normally be issued only to farmer cooperatives at its par value of a $100.00 a share.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.099" offset="742061">Farmer cooperatives may acquire Class C stock in four ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.246" offset="758675">First, each must purchase at least one share of Class C stock to be eligible to borrow from the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.190" offset="786469">Each of the respondents purchased the so-called qualifying share and capitalized its cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.431" offset="811442">The capitalization treatment of the so-called qualifying share is not here in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.524" offset="835788">Second, each borrower must invest quarterly in Class C stock, an amount equal to at least 10, but not more than 25% of the interest and payees to the bank on its loan during the calendar quarter.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.096" offset="894093">The percentage requirement of the New Orleans Bank during the year’s here at issue was 15%.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.023" offset="917813">It is the proper treatment of the cost of the Class C stock purchased under the 15% requirement that is herein dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.309" offset="950936">The respondents contend that they may deduct in addition to the stated interest on their loans, the cost of Class C stock in excess of a nominal value of a dollar share.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.133" offset="994195">They contend that this is deductible as interest or as ordinary necessary business expense.</text>

            <text syncTime="262.205" offset="1122508">Our position Mr. Justice is however that even though there is no stated return on the stock, that the farmer cooperatives do indeed on the return in that they have a right to share in the profits of the year in which they purchased stock.</text>

            <text syncTime="289.829" offset="1233058">At the end of each year, each farmer cooperative gets what is called the patronage refund and then it initially issued in the form of Class C stock.</text>

            <label>Mr. Matthew J. Zinn</label>
            <text syncTime="321.950" offset="1361476">The way it realizes it perhaps I can refer the Court to the graph on page 163 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.686" offset="1396480">It shows a revolving wheel and the farmer cooperative puts in its dollars at the top of that wheel and gradually as subsequent borrowers make investments in Class C stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.621" offset="1452173">After the government’s capital has been retired completely, and the Class B stock has been retired completely, the Class C stock whether purchased or issued as a patronage refund is revolved out on the cooperative principle of retiring first the oldest contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.921" offset="1533362">Now to give you some idea of what is involved here Mr. Justice Brennan, let me refer you to page 8 of our opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.766" offset="1568784">There are several in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.868" offset="1577143">We set out there in figures for the Class C stock purchased; the patronage dividends and the allocated surplus credits received by each farmer cooperative here -– each of the respondent cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.257" offset="1634717">Now, let us just take Mississippi Chemical for 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.263" offset="1654779">They paid in $18,940.00 in change for Class C stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.132" offset="1678185">Now, that money presumably was used to retire Class A stock or Class B stock or earlier issued Class C stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.739" offset="1712666">And the same how they received a patronage dividend in the form of the Class C stock bookkeeping entry of $27,000.00 and they also received an allocated surplus credit of some $12,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.821" offset="1772957">The way this thing works is that at some future time after enough later people have purchased Class C stock they are going to get back not only the 19,000.00 that they came up with at the outset but the total of those three numbers in that line which is just under $59,000.00.</text>

            <text syncTime="476.638" offset="1980265">The statute does provide for an allocation in terms of the interest paid by each cooperative to the interest paid by all, but the stock is purchased in the same proportion and the respondents’ contention is that we should not decide this case by reference to cooperative principles because it is perfectly clear that this is the provision of capital from the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.210" offset="2062498">And if that were recognized this would be a nondeductible capital contribution and what we are saying is simply this that if they do not want the case decided on the basis of cooperative principles under which we clearly prevail, we look at the substance of the thing, the substance is that you are sharing the bank’s profits for that year.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.350" offset="2543047">Well, we do not use those terms because we do not find them in the legislative history, the respondents do.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.771" offset="2564781">The legislative history refers to these as investment and patronage refunds and we will stick with those statutory terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.028" offset="2605845">The position of the respondents here is that all they got was the right to receive the money they paid in at some indefinite future time.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.857" offset="2645133">Now, we think we have already shown that they got more than that if they got the right to receive that money back in cash and also got the right to receive the profits of the year in which they made the purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.209" offset="2694557">But our position here does not turn on whether there is a retirement or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.659" offset="2716291">In the last brief which we filed in October, we attempted to respond to the respondent’s contention that there exists a universal principle that if as a condition to a loan, a borrower is required to purchase an asset at more than its fair market value, the excess is deductible interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.919" offset="2817333">We attempted to dispute the assertion of that universal principle by putting the hypothetical of a case in which a borrower goes to a commercial bank and asks to borrow $10,000.00 for 10 years and the bank says very well, we will loan you $10,000.00 for 10 years at a stated interest rate of 8%.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.964" offset="2917538">But as a condition to that loan, we are going to ask you to keep on hand in a non-interest bearing checking account $1,000.00 during the term of the loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.954" offset="2969470">We say in that case that only $800.00 is deductible interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.795" offset="2988905">Now, the fair market value of that compensating balance may be zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.046" offset="3005832">It may be that there is no market for restricted compensating balances.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.733" offset="3020670">Nonetheless, we say it is clear that you cannot deduct the whole $1,000.00 because you still own it.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.130" offset="3046165">The present value of the $1,000.00 compensating balance that is the right to receive $1,000.000 in 10 years, we assume to be $650.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.298" offset="3090887">Nevertheless, we urge that the $350.00 difference is not deductible interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.129" offset="3114188">It is simply interest that they might have earned, but did not earn and they might have earned it had they been free to invest the $1,000.00 at a growing rate of interest for the 10-year period rather than a non-interest bearing checking account.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.866" offset="3185137">For this latter proposition, we relied on this Court’s decision 30 years ago in Hort against the Commissioner in which the Court held that no deduction is allowable or income that might have been but was not earned.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.016" offset="3237800">In the paper which respondents filed last week, they now can see that only $800.00 is deductible interest in that hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.760" offset="3272699">Under their analysis, the borrower in the hypothetical really borrowed only $9,000.00 and so they say the proposition which they originally asserted that whenever a borrower is required to purchase an asset at more than its fair market value, the excess as deductible interest remains intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.871" offset="3353156">We disagree and we submit that by conceding the hypothetical, respondents have conceded this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.002" offset="3381682">Let me put a second hypothetical to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.856" offset="3393071">Instead of having to pay in to the checking account $1,000.00 at the outset, the borrower has to pay only $100.00 at the outset, but on each succeeding anniversary of the loan, must also pay $100.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.295" offset="3462871">Under respondents’ analysis, the amount of the outstanding loan during the first year would be $9,900.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.037" offset="3489829">The amount during the second year would be $9,800.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.368" offset="3503204">The amount during the third year would be $9,700.00 and so on, so that on the tenth year, the amount outstanding on the loan would be $9,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.046" offset="3545835">The average balance over the 10-year period would be $9,450.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.525" offset="3567778">Nonetheless, no more than $800.00 would be deductible as interest in any of those years.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.041" offset="3597871">If $1,000.00 based at the outset is not deductible as respondents now concede, a fortiori a $100.00 placed each year is not deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.880" offset="3645205">It is no more fictional to say in this second hypothetical that the amount of the outstanding loan was reduced gradually to $9,000.00 than it is to say that the amount of the loans reduced gradually or reduced in the first instance to $9,000.00 in the hypothetical put in our reply brief and neither of those cases is this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.803" offset="3744888">But let me move matters somewhat closer to home.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.213" offset="3758577">Take the same facts as in the second hypothetical except that instead of being required to keep the compensating balance on hand for only the term of the loan 10 years, the borrower has to keep the compensating balance on hand for 13 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.235" offset="3834645">Under respondents’ analysis, the borrower has borrowed $9,000.00 for 10 years or $9,450.00 in the periodic payment case and has had to leave on deposits for three additional years in a non-interest bearing checking account of $1,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.764" offset="3916774">The fourth case tells us that interest that they might have earned on that checking account, had it been invested at the growing rate of interest instead of a non-interest bearing account.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.013" offset="3969751">It is not the deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.961" offset="3981558">Finally, let me move to the last hypothetical which I think approximates this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.915" offset="4005382">It is the same as the facts in the third hypothetical except that instead of the banks agreeing to release the compensating balance at the end of 13 years, the release is to be made at an indefinite future time.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.628" offset="4068180">This in effect is the situation in the instant case, on the respondents’ assumption which we do not agree with that purchased Class C stock earns no return that it has on other value to respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.051" offset="4129933">In other words, that gives the respondents only the right to get their money back at some indefinite future time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.979" offset="4157623">Now, here just as in the third hypothetical what the borrower has foregone is simply the interest income that he might have earned from the end of the tenth year, until the indefinite future time that will receive its money back.</text>

            <text syncTime="1137.144" offset="4622289">And these purposes can only be achieved if the Class C stock has rolled over.</text>

            <text syncTime="1219.039" offset="4949865">In this case, we have a very basic difference of opinion with the government in its position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.075" offset="4986018">In order for the government to prevail as has been indicated by counsel, they must establish this proposition which appeared on page 11 of their brief 15 is taken to all grand position on the case, neither the fact that respondents are required to invest in Class C stock in connection with their loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.283" offset="5066789">Now the limitations on transferability of the stock could convert its cost into a deductible expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.604" offset="5092075">If it otherwise would qualify as an income-producing asset providing benefits in 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.445" offset="5135439">Our position is and I will demonstrate that this is not an income-producing asset, that in fact it has only a nominal value or as the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held while it is not worthless using the words of that Court, it was without an appreciable market value and had only a nominal value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.637" offset="5240242">As said again by that Court, Class C stock shares are of no appreciable value to the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.436" offset="5275455">As said further in that Court, the Class C shares had no fair market value and no more than a nominal value and no value to the taxpayers “in the usual sense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.546" offset="5327909">Now, reference had been made by counsel both in the brief and in argument, taking the position that the patronage refund is credited upon the books as Class C stock and allocated surplus credited upon the books as a Class C stock, were credited upon and earned by the amount paid as interest override or for purchase of so-called of Class C stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.958" offset="5445564">Now, as a matter of fact that is wholly without any foundation and the statute and the regulations, in law or in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.426" offset="5475448">The statute provides in Section 1134 (g), all patronage refund shall be paid in proportion the amount of interest earned on the loans of each borrower bears to the total interest earned on the loans of all borrowers during the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.498" offset="5555697">It has no relationship to the free interest made at the end of the year, qualify C stock to with one interest, the amount paid as interest override on the Class C stock column, another entry on the patronage refund as Class C stock on the column, another entry as allocated surplus on the Class C stock column.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.476" offset="5651618">And the Regulation 70 part 162 which appear on page 65 of the brief as an appendix of the government, allocation shall be made in what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.302" offset="5698952">They are wholly unrelated to this, it is just override itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.471" offset="5711595">Allocation shall be made in proportion that the amount of interest accrued on the loans of each borrower bears to the total interest accrued on the loans of all borrowers during the fiscal year and shall be recorded as allocations at the end of the fiscal year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.095" offset="5786097">It is impossible to conclude that the interest made as patronage refunds, allocations of surplus are returns upon the interest made at the end of the year of the interest override amount on the so-called Class C stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.319" offset="5854955">Let us take an illustration as to what this really means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.504" offset="5867703">These Class C stocks are in either in that year or in subsequent years any income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.088" offset="5894035">Cooperative “A” has accumulated a $150,000.00 in par or face value of Class C stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.862" offset="5929143">Cooperative “B” has just come in and bought one qualifying share of Class C Stock on the basis of $100.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.894" offset="5961222">Each borrows from the New Orleans Bank for Cooperatives that is the same amount of money, their loans are identical now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.919" offset="6001346">The cooperative with $150,000.00 in par value of Class C stock, the cooperative with the $100.00 par value of Class C stock received the identical amount of patronage refund, the identical amount of allocated surplus, the same being related not to Class C stock or to interest override.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.671" offset="6092356">It is related to the interest paid upon the loan for the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.994" offset="6113672">That is true both as to the first year and as to every subsequent every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.990" offset="6141675">So that as a matter of fact it is impossible that this can be attributed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.069" offset="6165917">Now, this has been recognized by the government in this case, in the M.F.A case and in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.753" offset="6196742">In this case, that was included in the District Court an attempt to recover patronage refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.944" offset="6229447">The basis being that the patronage refund had a value which was a taxable value for basis of $100.00 per share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.361" offset="6263093">The District Court held against the government on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.428" offset="6275422">In the Court of Appeals the government abandoned that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.614" offset="6288170">It did not appeal from the District Court to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.002" offset="6301649">It has not appealed to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.731" offset="6312621">In the M.F.A. case, come to Eighth Circuit, it was not even involved in the District Court although it is one of the briefs it was indicated that it might have been involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.408" offset="6343341">But in the –- at the Court of Appeals level, it was not urged and now on the petition for writ of certiorari now pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.970" offset="6373538">It is not urged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.453" offset="6379494">And why is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.009" offset="6385764">And mind you, this is all the same Class C stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.426" offset="6403422">No difference on one Class C and another Class C, all interest as suggested by indicated on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.971" offset="6429545">Now why is it that we are not asked to pay tax on the Class C stock on the second column under the heading patronage refund?</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.167" offset="6462355">Class C was made for Class C stock under the heading allocated surplus but only those interests may at the same time at the end of the year under first column Class C stock said to be resulting from the payment of interest overriding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.620" offset="6516167">Here is the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.249" offset="6522645">In Rome and in Cafter, it was hereby the Fifth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit and in Regulation, Treasury Regulation 161-5-b-123 and 124, the IRS had taken the position that while this type of certificate or stock is issued and is received as patronage refund, the market value shall be taxed to the patriot at the time of the receipt and “the regulation,” this is taken all from those two decisions, “however, to the parts of this subdivision, any document which is payable only in the discretion of a cooperative association, shall be considered not to have any fair market value unless it is clearly established to the contract.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.260" offset="6738730">Therefore, this Class C stock while that being 1, 2, or third column does not have market value unless it is clearly established as contrary and this record, as we have shown in our briefs, as were found by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, as was found by the District Court, not only was not clearly shown to have value or market value it was clearly shown to have only a nominal value. That is a matter of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.005" offset="6853669">This illustration of the compensating balance is holding applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.344" offset="6879060">If there is a compensating balance, it is repayable when the loan is repaid as kept by loan value on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.847" offset="6901107">It serves money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.485" offset="6907586">What if it does not have as we pointed out in our supplemental brief?</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.899" offset="6921274">If it is a $10,000.00 deal you have a compensation of about $1,000.00, you save for about $9,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.219" offset="6946560">Say upon 8% you pay 8.9% but the number of dollars is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.835" offset="6965055">You pay $800.00 interest on a $10,000.00 loan but you deposit $1,000.00 you actually get $9,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.655" offset="7000268">Hence, you are paying 8.9% and you have a deduction for the full $800.00 paid and you do not ask for it or receive anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.186" offset="7026391">But that is your money, it comes back to you and you receive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.463" offset="7047497">Now here, if or when, or how under what circumstances, Class C stock may be revolved is within discretion of three borrowers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.853" offset="7097130">The market says it has recommendations to original Farm Credit Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.388" offset="7115207">There are important credit administration recommendations to the Farm Credit Administration within all three discretions not to be exercised in order for it to be repaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.811" offset="7156898">Now, not only that but there has been some inadvertent errors or omissions in the brief which has been filed by the government in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.133" offset="7190231">I think perhaps in receiving advice from the Farm Credit Administration their telephone –- it is just hard for telephone too soon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.154" offset="7226280">For instance, there is a statement made is not in the record, no evidences are supplied whatsoever it is not -- but the statement is made that they have been advised by the administration, Farm Credit Administration, this is note number 26 on page 21 that all the A stock in your bank cooperative have been repaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.411" offset="7319380">But, and this is what (Inaudible) assumes, but what actually happen was the clear implication, is it was repaid by the revolving of C stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.782" offset="7360862">The fact is Bank of Cooperatives, borrowed several millions of dollars on open market in order to pay it off and now the effect of it rather hastening the repayment of C stock as a financial matter, it means it would be a longer period time before the C stock can be revolved because they are paying a higher interest and no matter they borrowed the A stock then they were paying returns to the government on the A stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.794" offset="7460859">Now, it is a fact that by borrowing that money, inviting themselves by that additional interest and inviting themselves with taxes in all its exempt, they have reduced their financial ability to repay C stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.023" offset="7517806">But they have removed the legal inhibition which existed because they could not revolve C stock as long as A was outstanding, but that is a situation which has not improved the possibility of the revolving of the C stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.750" offset="7584680">And it is to that, now, I mentioned only in facing another time in which (Inaudible) note number 16 –- Of the note, I am sorry, on page 7, this is note on page 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.346" offset="7635044">Some reference is made to the possibility that if this Court holds this – the taxable income there might be a $100 million less lending power for the Banks for Cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.227" offset="7678616">I say that it is kind of a point to assume, but as a matter of fact, if it should occur that on the other side of the coin that the banks, it should be held this is interest income to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.849" offset="7729084">The statute having additional interest income or margin, the statute requires that that be paid to their patron.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.293" offset="7758864">It is not taxable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.293" offset="7766910">It increases the amount of patronage refund which is deductible from the bank and from their taxable sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.719" offset="7796585">In addition to that, depending on the discretion of the bank and they have full discretion, it would not affect their lending power in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.527" offset="7827827">If they, in their discretion simply said we would simply delay the revolving of the earliest C stock because we have a million dollars less or $500,000.00 less since this went out in patronage as additional margins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.103" offset="7894074">Therefore there would be no burden of whatever upon the banks if that occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.725" offset="7912568">Now, may I point out to the Court a few things, especially in connection with this Lincoln case?</text>

            <text syncTime="1966.520" offset="7939736">Before you get to that Mr. Satterfield, I would like to have your comment on analogy that Mr. Zinn suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.760" offset="7976725">I think he pointed out that as he saw it, this situation was very much like a borrower going to a bank to borrow $10,000.00, if I followed his hypothetical correctly, and the bank said yes, we will lend you the $10,000.00 at 6% or whatever, provided you leave $1,000.00 at all times in a non-interest bank checking account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.473" offset="8079543">Now, is he unduly over simplifying this transaction when he puts that analogy to us?</text>

            <text syncTime="2011.796" offset="8120921">In that instance the $1,000.00 is placed in the account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.002" offset="8145685">The actual $1,000.00 is repayable when the loan is repaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.764" offset="8168777">It is true that the borrower received $9,000.00 rather a net of $9,000.00, rather a net of $10,000.00 as a loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.709" offset="8204513">The only result is he paying a higher rate of interest because if he pays 8% on $10,000.00 that amounts to 8.9% on a $9,000.00 and there, there is no similarity to this situation at all because it is the money of the borrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.556" offset="8267938">It is repayable not in possible discretion depending on as I have listed in the brief at 11 contingencies it may or may not have, but it is fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.639" offset="8312242">It is money there belonging to the borrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.518" offset="8327811">Therefore there is no parallel to this case whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.995" offset="8341708">It is simply in that case you see not that there is a lack by the taxpayer of claiming what he might have earned by the use of $1,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.612" offset="8384131">He has said he required to pay a higher rate of interest because it gets the $9,000.00 loan and he spent 8.9% interest by paying the same interest that he would have contracted upon $10,000.00, otherwise $8,00.00 is all the interest what he paid on $10,000.00 loan on 8%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.800" offset="8456856">If he pays $800.00 a year on a $9,000.00 loan, he pays 8.9% and he has the right to deduct the full $800.00.</text>

            <text syncTime="2161.737" offset="8720588">Now in Lincoln, as the Court will remember, there was a secondary result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.046" offset="8741904">Now this secondary reserve in Lincoln, the money was deposited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.041" offset="8765832">Now, under the statute there, there were the mandatory provisions as the Court said in discussing the effect, three instances in which the party would get the money back and was required to be paid the money back by the statute, said the Court in that case –- this Court on that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.344" offset="8835109">The prospective refund indicates an in cash effect of institution of pro-rata share upon culmination of its insured status or upon receivership or liquidation, or when the primary reserve alone reaches suspension level was required to be made by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.564" offset="8915984">In other words, if the primary reserve got big enough the guy got back what he put in the secondary reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.222" offset="8942629">Now in addition to that, in that statute, there was income producing as a matter of fact because the statute required that the Home Loan of the Insurance Company (HLIC) pay interest upon the secondary reserve amounts in the identical percentages that they received from their obligations held by them with the Unites States government, and in the brief, filed by government in that case it was said without dispute that as a matter of fact, in the time involved in this particular case that there was earned from 3.15 to 4.43% annually upon the secondary reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.730" offset="9108663">That was always there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.763" offset="9116709">It was mandated to be returned under any or all circumstances which might occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.266" offset="9146802">Whereas in this case, this credit entered upon the books is (1) as to which the fund may or may not be repaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.890" offset="9189225">There is quite a difference between a legal right to receive by a depositing case with interest guaranteed by the statute or a right to receive back a compensating deposit with the bank with or without interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2303.112" offset="9286191">The statute itself is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.480" offset="9295595">The statute says in 26 U.S.C. 1134 (d) uses the words that the borrower shall be required to invest quarterly in Class C stock and of course as we said in Lincoln, so the statutory label of prepayment and advance premium contains 404 (d) are not controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.572" offset="9383994">But as you call it, the purchase of Class C stock is not controlled.</text>

            <text syncTime="3030.342" offset="12195083">We believe that there is a return on this investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.438" offset="12211488">Mr. Satterfield has addressed the fact that the statute provides for the allocation of each year’s profits on the basis of the interest paid by one cooperative to the interest paid by all and that is what the statute provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.842" offset="12269062">But stock is purchased in the same proportion that interest is paid and the statute might as well have provided that the return is payable in accordance with the ratio of the stock purchased by each cooperative, so the stock purchased by all for the profits of that one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.820" offset="12340951">Now, this is different from the division of profits in an ordinary corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3414.769" offset="13732755">One final point, the Court in the Lincoln Savings Case, not only discussed the secondary reserve, but also the Federal Home Loan Bank Stock that Savings and Loan Associations are required to purchase in order to be members of the Local Federal Home Loan Bank and the Court said, certainly, the FHLB Stock is an asset and its acquisition is capital in nature that is in 403 U.S. 356.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.553" offset="13851873">Mr. Justice Blackmun’s statement there is not qualified by whether you get or return or not get a return on FHLB Stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.788" offset="13892833">He recognized that, that is an asset, a nondeductible cost because it was a provision of capital for the Federal Home Loan Banks.</text>

            <text syncTime="3479.018" offset="13989800">Now, the fact of the matter is that certain Federal Home Loan Banks throughout the higher 1960s pay the return of roughly 13.75%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.169" offset="14046328">Now, the going rate of interest during the 1960s are presumably was more than 13.75% and nonetheless, there is no room for the argument that any portion of the contribution to the Federal Home Loan Banks capital is deductible because if they invested their money elsewhere, they might have gotten 5% or 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.762" offset="14132742">But that is the respondents’ argument in this case.</text>
