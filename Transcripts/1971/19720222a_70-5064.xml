            <label>Mr. Steven J. Cole</label>
            <text syncTime="32.692" offset="204448">The State of Texas provides public assistance to four groups of its needy residence and receives over 350 million dollars a year from United States for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.029" offset="245826">The four groups are the children deprived of parental care and support because of the absence, death, or incapacity of the parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.724" offset="276546">Persons over age 65, the disabled and the blind, these are the persons both Congress and the State of Texas have identified as needing financial assistance because they do not have a breadwinner in the household.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.099" offset="334120">Texas has established the welfare program covering all four groups in its Public Welfare Act of 1941 pursuant to a single provision of the Texas Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.774" offset="380827">There are two separate issues presented by this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.141" offset="394201">The first is whether the Equal Protection Clause and Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act permits Texas to pay AFDC recipients eight-ninths of whom are black and Mexican-American, 50% of the amount Texas has determined to be their minimum required needs while it pays all other welfare recipients, those receiving aid under the old age, aid to the blind and aid to the disabled programs, three-fifths of whom are white 95% or a 100% of the same minimum needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.101" offset="526067">The statutory issue presented today is whether Texas may consistent with the Social Security Act as construed by this Court in Rosado versus Wyman determine eligibility for AFDC and the amount of AFDC payments by subtracting outside income from 50% of the standard of need rather than from the standard of need itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.588" offset="616033">Both issues must be decided by the Court since a victory on either one to the appellants will still leave the other in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.247" offset="650619">The starting point for understanding both issues is the standard of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.036" offset="669845">This has been referred to by the Court in Rosado with the yardstick to determining who is eligible for public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.639" offset="696281">The standard is a dollar amount which represents the state’s judgment as to what is necessary to provide a subsistence level living in that particular state.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.976" offset="733584">In Texas, the items included in the standard or personal needs which include food, clothing, and personal incidentals shelter cause and a few special need items.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.736" offset="776634">Texas uses a single standard for all welfare recipients in the state regardless of the category under which the recipient receives as assistance.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="184.279" offset="810802">In other words, children under the AFDC have the same standard of need as blind adults or disabled adults or people over 65?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Steven J. Cole</label>
            <text syncTime="193.686" offset="848418">No, that’s not exactly right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.286" offset="854792">What happens is Texas has a standard budgetary allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.480" offset="867644">So for example shelter needs are budgeted according to the household size and not according to the category.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.477" offset="891573">Similarly, personal needs are budgeted according to age.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.762" offset="904738">Adults in the ADC Program, the caretaker, the mother caring for children receive the same budget and needs not receive but are budgeted for the same needs as adults in the Aid to the Blind Program or Old Age Assistance program.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.720" offset="952595">Children, the dependents of an old age recipient or dependents of an ADC mother are budgeted for the same amount in each program.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.169" offset="982374">Texas has made a judgment and we do not challenge it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.504" offset="995644">The children require less per month than an adult to supply the same minimum needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.252" offset="1018737">But we have not challenged that in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.891" offset="1029290">An example of how this work is at page 41 and 42 of our brief that might be helpful if I refer to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.857" offset="1061055">In table one, we have set forth an age couple both receiving old age assistance, that’s at page 41, and the state has determined that for each month that couple needs a $172.00 per month for a personal and shelter needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.382" offset="1135243">On page 42 at table two, is a mother and three children who received AFDC from the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.787" offset="1164813">Their monthly needs have been defined by the State of Texas now to be $182.00 a month or just slightly more than the two-person family receiving OAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.951" offset="1209535">Now, these amounts for both families are approximately $2,100.00 a year and ask the Court to bear in mind that this standard is far from generous.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.517" offset="1247778">The United States defined the official poverty levels about $3,900.00 a year for a family or poor and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, level of living budget is over $6,500.00 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.759" offset="1296680">In any case, we are not challenging in this lawsuit, the fact that Texas defines the needs of a family of four with three children to be only slightly greater than the needs of the family of two.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.332" offset="1338998">We accept that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.472" offset="1343595">Texas has made it.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.275" offset="1346730">We are not questioning it.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.047" offset="1353835">We also are not questioning the fact that that standard for both of those families is defined so inadequately.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.423" offset="1375360">That’s not an issue in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.270" offset="1382779">We again accept that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.484" offset="1391661">Our position is that having determined the subsistence needs of both families.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.291" offset="1410887">Texas may not discriminate in the percentage of those needs that chooses to meet for the various groups of recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.369" offset="1435129">In practical term, what has happened is that Texas has called the family in table one that since they are needy and since they are dependent because they are old, the state will guarantee them whatever they need to purchase a subsistence diet and adequate shelter according to Texas’ judgment in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.970" offset="1501584">While at the same time, the state has hold the children in table two that since they are equal need and their dependence is cause by the death or absence or incapacity of their father.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.775" offset="1540768">The state will only have them purchase 50% of what the state says they need to survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.774" offset="1572742">At the outset, we wish to make clear for the Court that the discrimination in the percent of needs pay is not related to any differences in the requirements of the various recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.974" offset="1613597">As we have mentioned, the percentage reduction is applied after the standard of need is a computed.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.392" offset="1635227">Therefore if there are any differences in need in these particular families for instance, economies of scale because there a lot more members of the household, or maybe a blind recipient needs to seeing live again and of course an AFDC family normally would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.114" offset="1690084">Those will be reflected in the standard of need before the percentages are thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.976" offset="1709623">We’re dealing with families that Texas has said after it computes the standard or equally needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.587" offset="1736059">As the Department of Health Education and Welfare pointed out a brief in the District Court of Alabama which I submitted to this Court in Whitfield versus King.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.641" offset="1772213">The percentage reduction as applied is essentially a physical measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.801" offset="1792902">It is unrelated to the needs of the various recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.646" offset="1808262">We also ask the Court to bear in mind that the percentage reduction in this case has nothing to do with the availability or none availability of other sources of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.116" offset="1850162">When income is actually available to a particular recipient whether it be an OAA recipient or an AFDC recipient, for example, child support to the ADC mother, social security benefits for the OAA family, that income is subtracted from the grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.024" offset="1909826">There aren’t any double benefits we are contending with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.449" offset="1919439">So the percentage reduction has nothing to do with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.652" offset="1932291">In fact, the way Texas applies to percentage reduction to do the AFDC family actually operates as a work disincentive.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.018" offset="1965728">Unlike no in the Dandridge versus Williams case involving family maximums that this Court decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.066" offset="1989969">Texas does not encourage an AFDC recipient to seek nonwelfare sources of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.497" offset="2011703">Since it’s impossible for the Texas AFDC family to use that income to get closer and closer to the standard of need because the way Texas applies the percentage reduction is it applies it for the standard first and then it subtracts outside income.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.253" offset="2070740">No AFDC family in Texas could ever end up with more than 50% of its needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.430" offset="2095400">So it has, it does not have that work incentive feature the Maryland Family maximum and indeed the Supreme Court of California unanimously decided in case Villa versus Hall which we’ve also supplied to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.323" offset="2150988">The Court noted that this too was a work disincentive feature and specifically referred to the Texas budgetary method which is similar to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.354" offset="2183067">It is this aspect that the percentage reduction is used by Texas which gives rise to a Social Security Act claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.703" offset="2208458">And with the Court’s indulgence, I’d like to finish the statement of the case with the facts they gave rise to a statutory claim and then returned to the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.667" offset="2244298">Prior to May 1969, the family described in table two receiving AFDC was determined by Texas to need approximately $165.00 per month under the Texas standard of need.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.951" offset="2293512">Since at that time, Texas used that standard to determine the amount of payment and eligibility for payments or all person families with income less than this amount receive some benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.768" offset="2340742">The precise amount depends on whether or not there are budget deficits.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.809" offset="2356938">The standard of need minus their available income exceeded the maximum grant level then in effect in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.012" offset="2381702">If it did, they only receive the maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.035" offset="2393822">Effective May 1, 1969, consistent with one of the mandates of Section 402 (a) 23 which is the subject of the Court in Rosado decision, Texas adjusted its standard of need by 11%.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.976" offset="2445545">The cost of living increased since that standard was last priced in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.323" offset="2462995">We are not challenging the adequacy of that adjustment in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.968" offset="2481594">As a result, the family in table two now is determined by Texas to need $17.00 per month more or now $182.00 per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.668" offset="2520360">Additional families therefore, those with income below this new standard of a $182.00 but above the pre May 1969 Standard of a $165.00 have now been determined by the State of Texas to be in need of public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.733" offset="2580650">But on that day, Texas stopped using its standard of need as the AFDC yardstick against which income would be compared and that --</text>

            <text syncTime="947.461" offset="3863471">The reason she did not appeal is not available to me.</text>

            <text syncTime="951.325" offset="3878936">It’s perhaps because the Jefferson point this appeal and she thought she was protected but more important than that, one of the appellants that is before the Court Mr. Vasquez is presently earning income.</text>

            <text syncTime="973.860" offset="3969111">The manner of computing the payment affects him seriously because if the percentage were applied after his income is subtracted, he would receive the much higher grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.840" offset="4012996">It’s our contention that Mr. Vasquez even if you don’t want to consider the unnamed members of the class who were not before the Court now that Mr. Vasquez has an interest in the computation method and he is raising the eligibility consequences since if the Court agrees with this on that point, we’ll have to strike the Texas method and he will get an increase grant as a result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1034.608" offset="4212154">With respect to our equal protection claim, our position is that the District Court incorrectly measured the discrimination against AFDC recipients according to the traditionally lenient equal protection test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.900" offset="4261264">Frankly, we believe that the treatment of AFDC recipient has a racial purpose to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.104" offset="4282058">In light of the enormous racial imbalance in the various welfare categories, the law of history of restrictive measures against AFDC recipient in Texas which are borne most heavily on blacks in the program, the States decision to allocate funds as it has with this little room for any other inference, this is particularly so when appellees almost frivolous explanation to add it to the picture.</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.287" offset="4374844">Our case however, does not depend in this Court’s finding a racial purpose to the discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1094.171" offset="4450391">This is just such a case, I first like to set out a very briefly to Court the racial impact of what Texas has done and then review the explanations put forth to the huge disparities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1505.391" offset="6095269">Your Honor, that is really one of the points that goes to the heart of why Texas has done what they’ve done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.396" offset="6119302">25% of all the people over 65 in the State Texas receive Old Age Assistance that’s an astounding figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.597" offset="6148036">The appellees have testified quite candidly that it was their political clout that is basically encouraged the legislature to appropriate as it has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.441" offset="6187429">Mr. Bond (ph) who is the Chairman of Public Welfare testified that OAA touches nearly every home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.690" offset="6208431">AFDC doesn’t touch as many people and the OAA people have the votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.766" offset="6228702">Now, I would think the legislatures have been responsive to them and they must have some input in to the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.000" offset="6253675">I point that that the AFDC children represent less than 3% of the state’s population of children under 18 compared to the OAA percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.710" offset="6292546">I really have no other response to the fact that they have not been formally brought before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.345" offset="6311040">I will point that the State of Texas is never made any motions to bring them before the Court either for whatever that’s worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.753" offset="6340715">I’d like to point out that the record shows that the Welfare officials would equalize if the legislature appropriated at a lump sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.060" offset="6369868">Mr. Bond’s deposition again indicated that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.865" offset="6381153">So, there is no welfare related reason for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.325" offset="6390975">The welfare expert says, if you give me a lump sum that’s what I would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.715" offset="6404559">I’d have a percentage across the board but they haven’t given him a lump sum even though the constitution permits it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.661" offset="6436324">The lawyer’s justification was that the discrimination is justified because AFDC children and mothers well, today employable are more likely to be come employable in the future and also because they’re more likely to get support from relatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.965" offset="6493584">Well, future employability potential obviously has no bearing on the rationality of current payment disparities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.942" offset="6521483">The welfare programs are designed to meet current needs and maybe that would justify in the running training programs by AFDC recipients but it certainly won’t justify current AFDC grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.570" offset="6567981">And surely, Texas won’t suggest that paying 50% of needs in OAA would be fair in light of the fact that a majority of OAA recipients receives social security, it just has nothing to do with the question before Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.993" offset="6617613">The District Court viewed the program as completely separate programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.273" offset="6634750">Whatever you do in OAA, you don’t have to do an ADC because they’re separate because we see an ADC the purpose is to strengthen family life and the purpose of the other program is self-care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.801" offset="6668918">The fact is that Texas Constitution and the Texas Statutes makes no such distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.404" offset="6687308">The purposes are single-minded, financial aid and rehabilitative services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.137" offset="6706221">Now, I would suppose that a blind person may need a different kind of social service that an ADC mother who’s husband just pasted away but I would suggest that those differences don’t justify a difference in the financial assistance you give to the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.733" offset="6784588">With respect to the statutory claim, Section 402 (a) 23 required each state by July 1969 to adjust the amounts used in that state to determine a family’s needs for AFDC and also to proportionally adjust any maximums that the state may have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.358" offset="6851148">Before this Court Rosado vs. Wyman, the petitioners argued that that section contemplate an increase in all AFDC payments by July 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.929" offset="6889391">They urged that any other construction would it render the statute of meaningless bookkeeping exercise.</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.775" offset="7008823">I think counsel has stated that there are initially to questions presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.161" offset="7034319">Your first a constitutional question involving the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.256" offset="7058665">This is based upon the manner and which the Texas legislature has allocated the money available between the various categories of welfare assistance in Texas, the aged, the blind and totally disabled and the dependent children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.961" offset="7125538">The statutory claim deals with whether the allocation of the money between these categories by the legislature violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.510" offset="7175693">Also, the Federal statutory issue of whether the Texas method of determining eligibility violates the Social Security Act and in particular 42 U.S.C. Section 602 (a) 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.436" offset="7239432">Also, I think we have in this case an additional issue of an old age by the appellants and that is whether there is any just issue controversy appellant and appellees as to the statutory grounds allege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.435" offset="7311426">I think that it would help the Court somewhat if we look a little in the background of these welfare programs in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.617" offset="7348102">The Texas Constitution prohibits gifts to individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.906" offset="7369313">This welfare program that Texas has had been authorized by amendments to the constitution which allows these grants to be made to needy individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.519" offset="7419782">These amendments have all ways which authorized these grants have always put a limit upon how much money that legislature of Texas been appropriate to pay these grants and packed up until 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.777" offset="7492820">They even put a limit on how much they could appropriate for various wants of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.363" offset="7515181">However, in 1965 this was gone away with before the legislature could appropriate different varying sums, as they solved it, between the various categories were in operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1960.998" offset="7917675">Now, Texas in the late 60’s and starting really about 1968 like many other States had various regulations dealing with add-ons like a man-in-the-house, maximum grants, and certain rest of performance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2220.691" offset="8956409">The Court is recognized in these cases that the state have considerable latitude in allocating their AFDC resources.</text>

            <text syncTime="2257.537" offset="9103844">I think the court below recognized this when they saw that Texas only had a limited amount of money and they felt that it was the duty of the legislature of the state to use its judgment in the manner in the amount the available money should be divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.656" offset="9164343">I think that the court below possibly look to this Court’s warning in Dandridge v.

            <text syncTime="2321.916" offset="9361307">The Courts have long recognized that these are different programs with different objectives.</text>

            <text syncTime="2346.739" offset="9460676">I think that this is one that the legislature could have considered as wanting to devote more of their energy, more of the available funds in this area as opposed to another and not necessarily feeling that the child or the blind or someone else should suffer but realizing that they couldn’t create a utopia either with the money that they had.</text>

            <text syncTime="2648.751" offset="10668683">The AFDC got almost $12 million out of the $15 million available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.619" offset="10700134">Also, the Court looking at the depositions of the welfare department officials said that these people didn’t even know what the racial make ups of the various category was until after this suit commenced and they were required to do certain studies and come up with certain statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.968" offset="10781532">Another thing that we get in to here if we talk about leveling this out, if we took and these are stipulations in this case, if we took this money and leveled it out, it would not have a racial effect as the appellants seem to contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.760" offset="10860735">It would mean that practically and equal amount of racial groups in the adult program, the aged, the blind, and the disabled would have their grants lowered to in turn it raised about the same amount of individuals in this ethnic groups in the AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.272" offset="10942760">Now, if this was not the case, they might be some merit to appellant’s contention but leveling this out has no racial connotation because they’re going to be as many people in the Mexican-American and the negroes that will have their grants lower than this other programs as well have them raised in AFDC and I think this itself shows the lack of merit in appellants’ contention.</text>

            <text syncTime="3234.718" offset="13012598">I think that really that they have tried -- the appellants have tried to read in to this portion of the Social Security Act, that portion requiring this cost of living adjustment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3259.275" offset="13110818">The Court in Rosado recognized that the purpose of this was to make the States recognized that cost of living increases had occurred, that the state should adjust to them, that in turn it might prove the States to spend more money in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.916" offset="13209352">But I think that really what they’re asking here is that something new be read into this step that the eligibility requirements be change, the way that the States determine eligibility and I think that if Congress have intended this to be the purpose, they would have written in the end a whole lot clearer than this and not let to adopt a hope that some litigant might discover this hidden among this statute that this was the purpose of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.678" offset="13328366">I think that in conclusion that the question of whether to help the more at a cost of the many really, and this is the argument that they’re making in this case, is the business of the legislative branch not the judicial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.788" offset="13416869">I think that the arguments and hopes of the appellants in this case are ones that should be pursued in the legislative and congressional halls rather than in the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.041" offset="13461800">I think that really what they would like to do is when you strip all the argument in the rhetoric and the clichés that are used is that they would really like this Court to judge the wisdom and the propriety of the way the legislature of Texas has decided it would spend the money had available in the welfare area and turn these appellants this satisfaction with this plan and possibly, if they can get the Court to agree with them in to some form of constitutional or statutory prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.643" offset="13632222">I think that the path of this Court is clear and that is to sustain the judgment of the court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="3410.894" offset="13717277">Secondly, Mr. Vasquez whose eligibility has not been terminated has lost approximately $40.00 a month by the method of computation which streaked him because of its eligibility consequences he would gain $40.00 per month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.865" offset="13773179">In recital, the Court said at page 413 that 402 (a) 23 has the effect of requiring the States to recognize and accept the responsibility for those additional individuals whose income fall short of the standard need is computed in light of economic realities and to place them amongst those eligible for the care and training provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.702" offset="13856458">The Court said this because HEW came to the Court and told the Court, that’s 402 (a) 23 meant and if you’ll look at the amicus brief for this Solicitor General in recital, you will find those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.002" offset="13901702">The Solicitor General in this case says that yes the Court said it but that was dictum and he didn’t really mean to say it and I think if the Court looks at the basis for the decision in the New York case in light throughout New York’s program, you will realize it wasn’t dictum at all.</text>
