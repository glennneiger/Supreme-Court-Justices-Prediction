            <label>Mr. Joseph L. Rauh, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="50.187" offset="274455">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.806" offset="292950">The Courts below held the petitioner, the Head of the Reform Group, within the United Mine Workers could not intervene in the Secretory of Labor suit to upset the 1969 Union Election in which petitioner and his reform group have an intense interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.753" offset="380721">The question here on certiorari is whether the courts below erred heard in beholding that the Labor Management reporting and Disclosure Act carves an exception out of Rule 24 (a) and thus bars the intervention of petitioner's reform group.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.577" offset="460029">On May 29th, 1969, Mr Joseph Yablonski announced that he would run for President of the United Mine Workers of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.405" offset="499317">Between May 29th and December 9th of 1969, the date of the election, Yablonski was forced to bring five lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.819" offset="544979">In three of these, we got our preliminary injunctions giving us the right to mail out literature, getting Yablonski's job back after he was fired in reprisal firing and stopping the journal, the United Mine Workers journal from being used as campaign literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.490" offset="623660">In one of the five suits, we didn't get an order but the -- before that the Mine Workers had done in court what we asked for, namely to tell what rules of the election would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.362" offset="671098">In the fifth suit which was a suit to make to Mr. Bloch and the others payback what they have taken from the union is still pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.966" offset="701505">Now in addition to these lawsuits, Mr. Yablonski also sought an investigation by the Secretory of Labor of the massive violations going on during the election but despite the clear language in Section 601 of the LMRDA and despite this court's statement in footnote 5 in the Labors case that Section 601 applied here and he could investigate and despite the fact that we detailed the violations of law, the Secretory of Labor refused to make any investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.828" offset="832953">So there came December 9th and the incumbents declared themselves elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.017" offset="861792">Two points might be mentioned on this election, first, what we had poll watchers, we either broke even or one where we didn't -- we lost by margins up to 50 to 1, second, as was found by the Subcommittee on Labor, the decision was made by pensioners because they voted largely voted for them -- 93% voted for Mr. Bloch.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.790" offset="976835">On December 18th, nine days after the election, Mr. Yablonski challenged the election detailing to the labor department, these massive violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.360" offset="1023124">On January 5th, Mr. Yablonski was found dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.815" offset="1036917">On Jan 20th, the petitioner adopted the challenge, he had been Mr. Yablonski's campaign manager and he took over the challenge of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.427" offset="1079340">On March 5th, the Secretory of Labor brought the suit based on petitioner’s challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.466" offset="1107552">On April 1st, 1970, minors for democracy, the Yablonski reform group, was formed.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.027" offset="1133779">On October 2nd, when no progress had been made in the suit and answer hadn’t even been filed, we moved to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.843" offset="1173067">We saw three things then and now as our intervention, that is we seek to do three things by intervening.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.001" offset="1205668">First, to assure that the violations asserted by the Secretory of Labor are speedily and vigorously presented to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.858" offset="1241090">Second, to raise two additional grounds for upsetting the election, namely that Mr. Bloch by his illegal pension increase had engaged in improper interference with the election and second the voting through illegal locals had made it easy for them to steal the election, I referred at the pension vote because the illegal locals are pension locals.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.731" offset="1332623">Third to append a district court decree, ensuring that the new election would not be a repeat of the last one.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.504" offset="1363657">In other words, we seek to do three things to assist and push the Secretory of Labor to prove what he has set out to prove, to add two issues and to see that there is a decree, so there won't be a repeat.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.050" offset="1413916">The District Court said no to our intervention, he said at Page 112 of the Appendix that the Landrum-Griffin Act deprived the Court of Jurisdiction to permit our intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.563" offset="1475879">The Court of Appeals affirmed without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.861" offset="1493119">The case is here on an expedited schedule because the case is in trial below, this is the status below.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.272" offset="1534811">On September 13th of this year the trial started.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.410" offset="1551320">After about 5 weeks of trial, it went into recess, it reconvenes this coming Monday, November 22nd, for the completion of the Government’s case.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.674" offset="1600326">If we are permitted to intervene, we will not make any delays, we are not going to ask for discovery, in fact, I hereby waive discovery, so that we can go right into the case as it is and we will go on with our case promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.083" offset="1673991">So in other words, there's no question of the delays through our intervention.</text>

            <text syncTime="432.827" offset="1805021">Here it's in the charge and question is whether it can go in now that he went ahead.</text>

            <text syncTime="455.701" offset="1896450">Precisely, we believe -- that's precisely correct Your Honor, we believe that we are entitled to raise those two issues, and that there is -- because he has found probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.902" offset="1941276">Therefore, once we get in, we ought to raise it, we ought to elaborate it; secondly we feel less should be left to the district court who has control of how broadly intervention would go and third we say, well, if you we should not, I don't know, it doesn't seem why we shouldn't be in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.588" offset="2004074">And therefore, I would make it in that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.097" offset="2018076">Now, first, we meet the requirements of rule 24 (a) it fits us like a glove, indeed in the lower court, in the Court of Appeals, the government conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.969" offset="2077531">In the Court of Appeals, Judge Right asked Mr. Battochi was arguing for the government whether we didn't meet rule 24 (a) and whether his whole argument wasn't that the LMRDA sued at us and he said yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="578.965" offset="2389537">Yes, precisely You Honor and for example, our interest is obvious, Our whole life depends on the outcome of this election.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.788" offset="2428826">The only question that the government raises while we don't meet Rule 24 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="592.694" offset="2444499">Now that the confession has been withdrawn, is that, they adequately represented but they base that on the fact that they say there are no private rights but Your Honor, as I have made clear in both the Labors and in the Glass Bottle Blowers case that they are both, that there are private rights, and public rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.415" offset="2527359">Indeed strangely enough the government, at Page 33 of their brief cites to this proposition of no private rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.728" offset="2556617">The case that refers to private rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.026" offset="2569782">At the bottom of Page 33, the government says, in the words of this Court, “the Act was not designed both merely to protect the right of a union member to run for a particular office in a particular election.”</text>
            <text syncTime="636.974" offset="2621609">They asserted a vital public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.580" offset="2627983">Well, of course, I will be the last person to say, there isn't a great public interest here, but there is such an obvious private right.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.089" offset="2658076">It's exactly like the parallel case of Schofield, where this court unanimously referred to the inter-blending of public and private rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.217" offset="2698514">The same inter-blending of public and private rights that you have at the labor board, you have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.516" offset="2723696">Now, if there are any inter-blending of public and private rights which seems to me obvious then, we are the only one to protect the private rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.940" offset="2761417">The secretary doesn’t even claim to protect the private rights, he says, they aren't any.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.557" offset="2779911">So I am not -- there is a tremendous hostility between the labor department, and our side.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.191" offset="2806452">We do not however have to rely on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.519" offset="2823797">I am not relying on that to show we're not adequately represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.120" offset="2838112">I rely on this very simple propositions, that the Landrum-Griffin Act, as this court held, setup both public and private rights, and that we are properly to protect the private rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.401" offset="2899239">Now as Mr. Justice White said, you may not be able to get everything in there that you want to protect those private rights, that may, we argue the other side, we are still the person to protect the private rights insofar as the District Court in supervising would permit.</text>

            <text syncTime="765.160" offset="3134341">Now, assuming there are private rights as to which have a right to protect them under 24 (a), and we meet 24 (a), then the question comes down, does Landrum-Griffin carve out an exception to 24(a), does it say, it can't get in?</text>
            <text syncTime="784.767" offset="3212708">Now the government's brief demonstrates beyond peradventure of doubt what no one challenges, namely that we can't start the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.421" offset="3251369">Of course we can't start the suit, Section 403 and the Landrum-Griffin says it's a exclusive right of the secretory, but proving that we can't start the suit, has nothing to do with proving that we have in a right of intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.697" offset="3304450">And then what the government's brief does not direct itself to, is the difference between intervention in starting the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.508" offset="3335692">They don't mention the brilliant article by Professor Shapiro outlining these all of many differences between intervention and starting a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.003" offset="3373727">They don't mention that, they don't mention this court's decision and itself to be Phelps v. Oaks, which goes far beyond anything we suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.128" offset="3402148">In that case, this court said that in the diversity case, an intervention by a non-diversity person didn't cause a loss of jurisdiction, and the government doesn't mention that.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.104" offset="3458050">The government doesn't mention anything about the policy of strong enforcement, and having us in there will help strong enforcement, not weaken it.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.590" offset="3496084">Look at what we would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.733" offset="3504652">First we'll urge speed.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.084" offset="3514057">We have every motivation for speed, the government suggests we might want to slow it down or something.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.093" offset="3542060">We render a despicable dictatorship here that we want most, is a speedy decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.954" offset="3565466">We know the union, we can be helpful in the court on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.781" offset="3580826">We know the violations because we were there when the violations were occurring, and they wouldn't investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.218" offset="3606530">We think it would improve the situation to bring up the issues of pensions and bogus locals and wrap the whole think up as in Schofields.</text>

            <text syncTime="894.235" offset="3650625">In other words, we will be the ones who can help with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.367" offset="3667134">Now if Congress couldn't have thought that they wanted a one sided thing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.935" offset="3689390">You have to remember that Boyle is in that courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.332" offset="3707049">The other side, they two fractions says the Yablonski fraction and the Boyle fraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.735" offset="3724603">Boyle faired that general counsel of the union was the representative there.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.290" offset="3750830">But now they have new counsel which was just happened because of one man died, who was representing there but they have new counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.935" offset="3781446">The new counsel have already been disqualified in another case because they were too close to Boyle, and I would like to call Your Honor's attention, we didn't have time for reply brief, at the expedited schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.183" offset="3830452">But may I call Your Honor's attention to 77 L. R. R. M. 2921 where the new counsel were disqualified from the other case on conflict of interest because they are too close to Boyle, they are going to be there, and if we are not there to get a wholly one-sided operation, exactly what was referred to in cascade about the danger of the Court or the department not going under.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.898" offset="3949257">It will be a one-sided struggle in that courtroom with the Yablonski forces totally removed, since 24 (a) covers this, and since 24 (a) covers this like a blanket or we conceded it one time, and since there is nothing in the statute that indicates that you should carve out this exception, we respectably submit that it shouldn't be --</text>

            <text syncTime="1028.469" offset="4187598">Mr. Chief Justice, in answer to the question placed to me before luncheon, I would answer it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.170" offset="4230334">I assume that the question doesn't go to the first reason for intervention namely to support the labor department in this suit by vigorous actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.863" offset="4273175">Nor does it go to the last of the three points namely on the remedy, it goes to the second point of our adding issues and why can't we litigate that somewhere else?</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.436" offset="4311418">My answer to that, is that while there may be jurisdiction to support the issue in other places, it cannot be in an election context because of Section 403.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.863" offset="4357080">For example, take the case of Boyle against Blankenship, where the issue of Mr. Boyle's misconduct in the election race has already been adjudicated, he has been removed as trustee of the welfare fund because of his manipulations with the pension fund during the elections, but it doesn't bring it into an election context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.393" offset="4455301">So my answer sir, is that first, it doesn't apply to first our and third reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.713" offset="4480483">Secondly on the additional issues, we cannot raise them in a context where they can be utilized in the election suit, and if I may add this point, Schofield was predicated on the assumption that you would get all matters in one place that were appropriate to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.511" offset="4555715">In fact, the basis of Schofield was that there would not be a piecemeal litigation, and I suggest the same thing would be useful here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1387.279" offset="5622765">I would like to just take one or two points in the government's brief and make a quick speaking reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.733" offset="5644603">On page 17 of the Government's brief, they talk about how we slow it down and distort the planned procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.607" offset="5676055">I call Your Honors attention to the fact that in Schofield, the Solicitor General's brief at page 29 and 30 is almost the direct copy of all terrible things that would happen, if people got in and you let us in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.827" offset="5729031">On page 26, I am at 25, they suggest we left a sentence out of a court but the sentence that we left out says a careful reading of the bill makes clear that, except where the bill provides specifically to the contrary, certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.293" offset="5794860">Well, it is our contention of course, that the bill here does not specifically provide that we may not come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.787" offset="5824848">On page 26 is the very statute I mentioned before which the government says has something to do with intervention but in fact what it had to do with was the right of saving your private rights in State Courts under state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.806" offset="5892871">And finally on page 28 there's a reference to Mr. Cox (ph) who had a great deal to do with the adoption of the statute and Mr. Cox (ph) in the full quotation makes perfectly clear what he's talking about is the undesirability of piecemeal litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.501" offset="5971657">He thinks it should all be in one place and so do we.</text>

            <text syncTime="1571.589" offset="6360045">Before I begin, I would like to call attention to the brief which we have filed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.235" offset="6386586">For the first time and literally thousands of these briefs that I've seen, the table of contents and the table of cases is at the end and instead of at the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.099" offset="6434024">I don't have any idea why it happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.402" offset="6443323">The government printing office has printed these for 50-75 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.466" offset="6467565">As you will recall the case is here on an expedited schedule and when I found this out on Monday, I decided that we would simply leave it as it as and not try to incur overtime and what not and have it reprinted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.601" offset="6544052">I've already found that something of an inconvenience myself because naturally you turn to the front and I say I'm sorry but that's what happened and there are some things even a Solicitor General can’t control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.070" offset="6605910">The case here turns on the construction of a statute I believe which is illuminated by the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.392" offset="6679261">I do not think that I can demonstrate by logic like that involved in the binomial theorem, that the result for which I contend is inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.957" offset="6741537">I do think or hope that I can make about a stronger case on legislative history, as I can imagine short of demonstration which I think should lead the Court to the conclusion, that the statutory provision should be construed to prevent intervention in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.315" offset="6846968">Let me look first at the language of the statute to which not much attention has been paid in the argument so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.982" offset="6885629">And I'm referring now to the brief of the United Mine workers, the blue covered brief which has the statute's most comprehensively in the appendix at the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.523" offset="6939754">Let me say also by a way of opening that in this trial which is now going on, the work for the moment is in recess in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.890" offset="6989283">The Secretary is vigorously opposing the United Mine workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.773" offset="7012793">On this particular aspect of it, relating to intervention, the Secretary and United Mine Workers are on the same side, the United Mine workers have yielded the time which they could have had in this oral argument to me because they share our view that this is a suit and the District court which is and ought to be in the control of the Secretary but Mr. Coomes (ph) here is representing the United Mine worker.</text>

            <text syncTime="1834.333" offset="7411003">Certainly, no jury involved, and certainly if the court's decision is adverse to our position, the secretary will cooperate and trying to put the court's decision into practical effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.980" offset="7469622">Section 402 of the statute which is the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, quite a landmark in our labor relations law, Section 402 begins on page 5a of the Appendix to the brief, and it says, that a member of a labor organization who has exhausted his remedies in the union, and who has invoked his available remedies without obtaining a final decision within three calender months, may file a complaint with the Secretary under Section 481.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.083" offset="7617998">And Section 481 sets out in considerable details, standard for the conduct of elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.931" offset="7673377">402 (b) provides that the Secretary shall investigate and if he finds probable cause to believe that a violation has occurred, he should bring a civil action against the labor organization in the District Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.458" offset="7747461">And then Section 402 (c) provides that if upon a preponderance of the evidence after trial on the merits, the court plans that an election has not been held within the time prescribed by Section 481 or 482, that the violation of Section 481 of this title may have affected the outcome of an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.367" offset="7835128">The court shall declare the election, if any to be void, and direct the conduct of a new election under supervision of the Secretary, and so far as lawful and practicable in conformity with the constitution and bylaws of the labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.526" offset="7911823">And then I proceed next to Section 403 which is on the top of page 7a, there is a first sentence there which is not relevant to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.546" offset="7959888">But the next two sentences, I think are both highly relevant, “Existing rights and remedies to enforce the constitution and bylaws of a labor organization with respect to elections prior to the conduct thereof shall not be affected by the provisions of this sub chapter, whatever rights there are, State or Federal still remain”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.256" offset="8066677">And then the next sentence, “The remedy provided by this sub chapter for challenging an election already conducted shall be exclusive.</text>

            <text syncTime="2010.044" offset="8113906">Do you also agree with Mr. Rauh that, that preempts any state actions?</text>

            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="2018.830" offset="8149015">As to a suit after the election, yes Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.020" offset="8169808">As to a suit prior to an election, not at all, because it does not relate to a suit prior to an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.546" offset="8199901">Now, I agree that it does not say shall be exclusive and this shall apply to intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.818" offset="8232920">At no place does the legislative history or anything else contain the words, and this shall apply to intervention, that's why I say I can't mathematically demonstrate the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.050" offset="8281926">But I want to go ahead with the legislative history of the statute to show that, that language was deliberately intended by Congress, it was not incidental or accidental, and that the scheme which Congress meant to carry out by this statute is one which would be frustrating by allowing intervention of other parties and the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.686" offset="8404388">What Congress intended was not merely that the secretary should file a suit but that he should control the suit, and he will not control the suit if intervention is allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.280" offset="8458827">If Mr. Rauh's plan can intervene any other union member, can intervene including members of the opposition and the scheme which Congress deliberately set up in this difficult and delicate area, would I think be clearly frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.862" offset="8549106">Now the Labor-Management Disclosure Act perhaps can be said to find its legislative geneses in a bill which was introduced by Senator Kennedy in May 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.402" offset="8639281">And this contains essentially the language which is now found in Section 402, with only a very few changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.965" offset="8693511">Senator Kennedy said that, there had been evidence that some few unions have not conducted their affairs in a democratic manner and since free secret elections are the cornerstone of the democratic union movement, it appears appropriate that public safeguards be established, and that is the first legislative statement with respect to the language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.597" offset="8804061">The bill introduced in May 1958 contained the language that the remedies enunciated therein were to be exclusive, so that only the Secretary that brings such a civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.994" offset="8865606">Now this incidentally applied both before and after elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.121" offset="8902177">Nothing much came of that bill but in June 1958 there was introduced another bill as 3974 of that Congress known as the Kennedy-Ives Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.065" offset="8961946">Senator Kennedy had build up support within the senate and this was passed by the Senate on June 17, 1958, seven days after it was introduced, obviously showing that it had been worked on and agreed to by substantial number of Senators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.454" offset="9071451">And the committee report with respect to Section 301 in that bill is now Section 401, states that these provisions, “are to be enforced by the Secretary of Labor upon complaint of any union member” and the report further stated explicitly that, “private court litigation would be precluded”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.928" offset="9205407">In the course of the senate debates on June 12, 1958 Senator Kennedy presented some of the reasons for giving the Secretary the sole authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.627" offset="9272176">Senator Wiley expressed his concern that this would involve the destruction of the present rights of union members to seek State and Federal Court relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.020" offset="9325779">And Senator Kennedy responded that such relief was costly and time consuming as a practical matter unsatisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.280" offset="9366843">He said that, the bill chose rather to “provide the right to appeal to the Secretary of Labor, whenever a member believes that his rights as provided in the bill in the case of an election have been denied to him”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.479" offset="9443643">Now the petitioners in this case do refer in their brief on page 28 to a statement of Senator Kennedy in the debate which they say points in their direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.986" offset="9505606">But as Mr. Rauh has already indicated in giving the quotation on page 28 of their brief, they omit entirely the immediately preceding sentence, which contains the language which he read except where the bill provides specifically to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.594" offset="9596094">And we contend that this bill does provide that with respect to post election relief, that the enforcement rights are solely in the Secretary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2636.676" offset="10620408">And I would call attention to cases such as (Inaudible) and Wilson and United States v. Sherwood, both in 312 US.</text>

            <text syncTime="2959.273" offset="11910752">I repeat this does not foreclose Mr. Rauh and his clients from raising and whatever appropriate court there is any issue including these two issues in advance of any election, including the election which will be conducted by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.619" offset="11972192">Indeed, I am not sure that it precludes the Secretary from filing a suit in connection with the holding of the election under this suit in which he in effect asked for an instructions, asked for a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.552" offset="12039901">This is somewhat complicated by this court's decision last Spring in the Hodgson v. the Steelworkers case which says that the Secretary can't raise issues in the 402 proceeding which were not presented to him by the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.279" offset="12130808">But I am not sure after the 402 proceeding is completed, and it has been decided that there shall be a new election that the Secretary cannot then raise in court questioned with respect to the conduct of that election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.370" offset="12187128">And I know of no reason why Mr. Rauh and his clients cannot raise those questions in court with respect to the conduct of an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.577" offset="12231954">Now let me say that the position advanced here by Mr. Rauh is a reasonable one, it was the view of a large part of Congress and the bill passed the House once and depending how you interpreted, I think twice the way he says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.045" offset="12325890">But the other view is the one which was finally enacted by Congress and both Houses adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.685" offset="12356401">We have set out in our brief more legislative history including important statements by Professor Cox who was well known to be Senator Kennedy's immediate advisor and the draftsmen of the Act, and among other things, he said that the purpose of the bill was to centralize control of the proceedings in the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.292" offset="12466847">It was also Professor Cox who recognized, and I assumed prevailed on Senator Kennedy to except the change so that the exclusive suit by the Secretary was made applicable only to post election proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.132" offset="12534243">The House adopted the bill in such a way that the employee could bring the suit at anytime, there were hearings before the House Committee in which Mr. Railey(ph) made essentially the same point that Mr. Justice White has been making with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.426" offset="12635389">He said, “There is all the difference in the world between having an administrative remedy and being able to control the litigation yourself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.855" offset="12673110">Would you not rather prepare the case yourself and present it, then go to an administrative agency?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.293" offset="12702889">The House adopted the bill that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.577" offset="12720026">It went to conference and it came out of conference in the form of the Senate Bill with the language in the statute to which I have referred, which seems to me to be, to use a word which just came into our law recently,be to be facially conclusive, the exclusive suit by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.899" offset="12833292">And which I believe is thoroughly supported by the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.511" offset="12867774">It is perfectly true the legislative history does not say and there shall be no intervention, but it seems to me to be very clear or indeed the sort of question which the courts are well qualified to decide, that it was the contemplation an expectation of Congress that there should not be any sort of interference with the suit brought by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.685" offset="12976443">But this was allocated to the Secretary for a very real public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.943" offset="13001417">After all, when there is a dispute about an election, after the election has been held, there is a great deal of feeling in many quarters and if you then have the big complete comprehensive lawsuit in which all the issues are raised and all the emotions are led out, things become not only difficult but perhaps unsatisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.004" offset="13109668">And the purpose was to filter this through, the Secretary of Labor, and I may say that in this case he made an enormous investigation with respect to what went on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.671" offset="13160346">And then have the Secretary decide which issues he thinks are the ones which should be presented in court, and if we go through all that process, but nevertheless the union disputants can intervene on both sides and convert the lawsuit for setting aside an election and providing for the conduct of a new election, convert that into a general intra-union dispute settlement procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.202" offset="13290435">We have, it seems to me, destroyed the very remedy which Congress deliberately chose and established in these particular cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.241" offset="13346651">Now I agree that rule 24 (a) is there, it's not unimportant, I don't say it is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.676" offset="13384372">Rule 82 which seems to me, restricts its scope and I think that although rule 24 (a) might in other settings be adequate to allow for intervention here, generally of course intervention is encouraged, it is welcomed, that was the function of enlarging the scope in rule 24 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.804" offset="13476845">But here there is a very special reason for keeping the control of the suit in the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.442" offset="13511431">That reason was explicitly intended by Congress by a close division; the House one way, the Senate the other way, we do not know what went on in the conference to lead to the choice to the Senate Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.598" offset="13580081">We do know that both Houses of Congress approved the Senate Bill and provided in the laws, it has been since 1959, that the suit by the Secretary should be exclusive and we think that exclusive means that there should not be intervention.</text>

            <text syncTime="3401.111" offset="13678092">The learned Solicitor General has demonstrated that we can start suit, and when he says that the Bill passed the House the way we see, it didn't pass the House the way we see.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.020" offset="13721769">It passed the House saying the individual could start the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.685" offset="13736398">Nobody ever considered the position we take and – that the secretary can start the suit but intervention under 24 (a) is something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.365" offset="13779134">I would not have raised the question that the Secretary is vigorously opposing the UMWA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.835" offset="13809018">But since Mr. learned Solicitor General raised that issue, I have to state to the court that in our opinion, the case is not being prosecuted with the vigor it should.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.141" offset="13866279">I simply make the point, I have refrained from saying that but I cannot let the record stand with only the Solicitor General's statement that the Secretary is so prosecuting of what we feel so strongly that it is not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3463.963" offset="13929495">Yes, precisely sir, however, we don't need that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.450" offset="13951438">We have private rights and the Solicitor General in oral argument, did not suggest that we don't have private rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.556" offset="13971918">He suggested that under 24 (a), he was arguing that the word exclusive prevents intervention although it doesn't say it, but we have private rights and we are entitled to represent those rights because the Secretary doesn't even claim he is representing those rights, all applied from the fact that we do not agree that the case is being vigorously presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.295" offset="14050808">I only answered it because I didn't want the record to stand one way on that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.457" offset="14071497">I don't think it is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.408" offset="14083304">Now Mr. Solicitor General states the union disputants could intervene on both sides, but the union disputant is there on one side, that's what the point is, Mr. Boyle is in the courtroom and we are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.120" offset="14142132">It's as simple as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.444" offset="14147461">It would be one thing if counsel -- for Mr. Boyle, counsel for the Union were independent, Mr. Boyle but it's Mr. Boyle's counsel, they are fighting for Mr. Boyle and we are not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.457" offset="14195526">It would be absolutely hopeless that the case could be a straight down the middle, Judge Brieant has the advantage of Boyle in the courtroom, he doesn't have the advantage of the Yablonski.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.134" offset="14250174">Now, finally and most importantly, on rebuttal, this idea that we could start a suit for the fourth coming election, now if Your Honors, please would you look at item E of Section 402, it's on our brief, for example, at the bottom of page 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.389" offset="14339199">It says, if upon a preponderance of the evidence, the court finds that there should be a new election, the court shall declare the election if any to be void and direct the conduct of a new election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.097" offset="14390086">Now, how on heaven's name can we start a suit after that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.251" offset="14402729">You will have a decree giving the conditions of the new election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.436" offset="14419448">What would time period be, a couple of months?</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.972" offset="14437524">The desire of Congress for speed is evidenced by a provision in 402 (d) that there can't even be a state pending appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.534" offset="14479843">The minute the District Judge enters the order, saying that there is to be a new election and enters a decree giving the conditions of that new election, it will be held, the suggestion that we then start a suit about a forthcoming election, and a election that can't be stayed is just impractical and unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.566" offset="14559986">The fact of the matter is if we can't get there, we can't go anywhere.</text>
