            <text syncTime="16.443" offset="139933">As Your Honors will recall before the recess yesterday, we were discussing, whether or not, publication of a subcommittee record by Senator Gravel is protected by the Speech or Debate Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.946" offset="185909">We then demonstrated that the clause has always been read broadly to cover all necessary functions of legislators.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.780" offset="217256">That the informing function for Congress is precisely just such an essential function of legislators and that the publication of the subcommittee record is a classic example of the exercise of the informing function.</text>

            <text syncTime="80.660" offset="396769">We are not arguing that aides are unaccountable or that printers are unaccountable for what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.002" offset="418189">We have all along throughout this proceedings, Your Honor, treated this as a matter of testimonial privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.425" offset="439819">Our contention is that the Grand Jury cannot inquire into the privileged legislative conduct of Senator Gravel.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.502" offset="468136">Now whether anyone can be invited or prosecuted is another matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="122.440" offset="563953">It does not necessarily follow that anyone else is, but as the clause is always been construed, the privilege for the legislator himself is both with respect to inquiry and with respect to accountability.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.958" offset="610033">Now if for example, Beacon Press were prosecuted, the Court would then have to face the question as English Courts have had to, of whether printers of parliamentary proceedings to assist Senators are immune.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.351" offset="655590">The English courts have said, yes, but that question is not presented in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="528.307" offset="2187411">We did ask for a specification of questions in advance because of the kind of enforcement problems that we have, because Senator Gravel isn't there.</text>

            <text syncTime="541.194" offset="2238924">The dilemma of course is, that it is Senator Gravel’s privilege and he must have some mechanism of enforcing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.543" offset="2260345">He can't rely on other people to make a decision to perhaps risk contempt in order to vindicate his own privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.351" offset="2291587">Now the specification technique of -- to which I am alluding has been used by the Government before in privilege cases, such as husband-wife privilege case and as a matter of fact there was a fairly specific specification in the Caldwell case of what kinds of questions were going to be asked to Mr. Caldwell, but we think that a general protective order dealing with the acquisition by Senator Gravel on the receipt, the preparation for the subcommittee hearing, the holding and publication is cleanly sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="812.474" offset="3324051">First in supplementing the response to Mr. Justice Blackmun's question, I think it may be said that, Dr. Rodberg is the physicist.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.334" offset="3383505">In my view this case does not involve any fair application of the Speech or Debate Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.859" offset="3437631">The case has now been argued before the Court for nearly an hour and no one has yet referred to the text of the Speech or Debate Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.984" offset="3486114">It appears at the bottom of page 2 and the top of page 3, of the government's principal brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.338" offset="3519551">Of course, I know it is familiar to the Court, although it has been involved in a surprisingly small number of decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.122" offset="3566676">But it seems to me, relevant and appropriate, that before proceeding further with this case, we get back to the bedrock.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.761" offset="3605233">What does the Constitution say?</text>
            <text syncTime="888.093" offset="3626549">The Senators and Representatives, nobody else, the Senators and Representatives shall receive compensation and they shall in all cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, which covers almost everything, be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses, no effort to give a sweeping immunity to Congressman or Senators, and in going to and returning from the same, and for any speech or debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other place.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.513" offset="3832185">Now there are three groups of words of limitation in that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.585" offset="3868547">The Senators and Representatives, not the Senators and Representatives and those associated with him and those who assist him and members of their family and staff and servants as it used to be in England, and which they we're trying to get away from, and speech or debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.692" offset="3960916">Now speech or debate is not everything they say, everything they do, and finally in either House.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.169" offset="4026849">It is suggested that our argument here, and I must confess I have a little feeling like, arguing that no law means no law, but it is suggested that, our reference to stylistic precision which is the phrase we use in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.013" offset="4122248">This is a case where it seems to me, that the language was very carefully written and very carefully intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.808" offset="4161432">It is suggested that, this is simply the language of the committee on style.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.569" offset="4184420">They didn't mean any such limitations and that that there is evidence by the language which had been used by the committee on detail, which was the only place in the convention where the matter was considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.385" offset="4255682">There surprisingly there is very little available in the history of the convention, but let's look at the language which had been used by the committee on detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.100" offset="4298522">This appears at the bottom of page 92 of the big red brief, Senator Gravel's main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.025" offset="4334258">Now the committee on detail and which is what the convention voted for wrote, freedom of speech and debate in the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.023" offset="4394235">Well now who engages in speech or debate in the legislature, no one but Senators and Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.626" offset="4424642">Freedom of speech and debate in the legislature shall not be impeached or questioned in any court or place, out of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.451" offset="4463930">And I would suggest that there is no significant difference in meaning, between the phraseology of the committee on detail and that of the committee on style.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.222" offset="4515025">The committee on style did make it a little more elegant, but it did not limit it beyond what had been adopted before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.968" offset="4574062">Now the significant fact in this case with respect to this language, is that the Senator Gravel is not being questioned by anybody in any place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.341" offset="4631531">The Constitution and the privilege granted by the Constitution to Senators and representatives is being fully compelled with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.826" offset="4681478">There is an analysis of this clause, which as far as I know does not appear as yet in any of the opinions of this Court, but which I think clarifies it's meaning and application, and on the basis of which the privilege itself, and the several cases which have been decided about it fall very well in the place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.819" offset="4809478">Questioned, is the keyword at the end of this constitutional provision, and questioned may be read in two senses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.644" offset="4860782">First, as I have just indicated with respect to questioning Senator Gravel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.351" offset="4895577">Perfectly clear that Senator Gravel cannot be questioned about any speech or debate which he has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.851" offset="4929536">It's not necessary here to determine the limits of speech or debate, because Senator Gravel is not being questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.960" offset="4962033">No subpoena has been issued against Senator Gravel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.012" offset="4978229">There is no suggestion that he is being questioned, but the word question can also be read in another sense, that is of being subject to charges in which reliance is put on evidence of speeches or debates by the member.</text>

            <text syncTime="1272.513" offset="5164220">He has not been indicted, he has not been summoned, he is not subject to charges, and I would suggest that when those conditions exists, the Speech or Debate Clause is fully satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.176" offset="5246872">This case is not like the Johnson case, in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.848" offset="5277592">The Johnson case was an indictment of a Congressman, based upon facts arising out of a speech which he had made in the house of representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.509" offset="5336211">And the Court held that evidence with respect to that speech could not be introduced in the trial against Johnson without violating the Speech or Debate Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.764" offset="5393262">It was not merely that he could not be someone than required to testify, but he could not be required to answer a charge based upon the speech which he had given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.954" offset="5445925">That is not involved in this case. Senator Gravel had not been summoned and required to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.352" offset="5471525">He is not required to answer a charge based upon the speech, but this case is like the Johnson case in the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit before it got here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.823" offset="5541429">You will recall that there were two Congressman who were indicted, and two private individuals, and they were all indicted for conspiracy, and for engaging in certain acts or in aiding or abetting those acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.057" offset="5614362">And it is true that the Court referred on page 176, in the Johnson opinion to the fact that, the constitutional infirmity infecting this prosecution is not merely a matter of the introduction of inadmissible evidence and Senator Gravel in his brief says that that's a decision that this evidence is inadmissible, and therefore can't be acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.458" offset="5748005">Well, we agree that it is inadmissible against Senator Gravel, if there ever should be any sort of a charge against Senator Gravel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.730" offset="5793040">But the Johnson case in the Fourth Circuit, involved two persons who were not Congressmen and their convictions were sustained in the variable opinion of Chief Judge Soboloff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.022" offset="5862212">I've read it again a few days ago, and it is a remarkably fine opinion and this is the language which is used with respect to them at page 193 of 337 F2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.121" offset="5930653">Count one of the indictment is unconstitutional, as applied to defendant Johnson, but as none of the privileges of Article 1, Section 6, pertain to the defendants who are not members of Congress, their attack on the first count unlike Jonson's is not sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.872" offset="6045696">Now it is true that that this Court did not review that decision, and expressly left open its propriety and the decision in the Johnson case itself which involved only Congressman Johnson, but I submit that the decision reached by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Chief judge Siboloff's opinion is a sound construction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2866.037" offset="11538307">It was probably from this view of the encroaching character of privilege that the framers of the Constitution and they have cared to provide that the law shall bind equally on all and especially that those who make them shall not exempt themselves from their operation, have only privilege Senators and Representatives themselves from the single act of arrest in all cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace during their attendance at the session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same and from being questioned in any other place for any speech or debate in the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.657" offset="11728792">And I would like to suggest, that the decisions of this Court with surprising consistency support our position that the Speech or Debate Clause, provides no privilege to aides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.570" offset="11816459">Perhaps the first case involving this matter is Kilbourn against Thompson, which was a suit against the speaker of the House and against the sergeant-at-arms of the House, and the House had by vote decided that Thompson was in contempt and had ordered him to be arrested and the Speaker issued a warrant directed to the sergeant-at-arms to arrest Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.871" offset="11961595">Thompson got habeas corpus and he sued the Speaker and the sergeant-at-arms and this Court held that the suit must be dismissed as to the Speaker, he was protected by the Speech or Debate clause and it held with the suit could be maintained against Thompson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.723" offset="12057099">Although he was not just a aide to a Congressman or a Senator, but was one of the officers of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.241" offset="12095133">He was not protected by Article 1, Section 6 and we know that resulted in a judgment for $20000 in favor of the plaintiff and which was eventually paid out of the Senate's funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.128" offset="12174650">And then we have more recently, the case of Dombrowski against Eastland, which was a suit against a Senator and against the chief counsel of his committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.995" offset="12234105">And the Court held that the suit could not be maintained against the Senator at least facts alleged on that case, but he held that it could be maintained against the chief counsel of the committee and the case went back for a trial against the chief counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.392" offset="12327727">And more recently we have Powell against McCormack, which was Congressman Powell's suit against members of the House of Representatives, the Speaker and other members, and against the doorkeeper and other officers of the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.538" offset="12420305">And the Court held that the speaker and the other members could not be sued, they were protected by Article 1, Section 6 of the Constitution, but it also held that the officers of the House of Representatives who were only doing what they were told, were subject to being questioned in the courts and were the basis for a declaratory judgment which this Court send the case back to the lower court to consider and to enter.</text>

            <text syncTime="4224.198" offset="16970940">It is rather fun to read that case as you might guess from the name it arouse out of Nantucket.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.689" offset="17000929">There is nothing to indicate whether the two parties were brothers or otherwise related, they may not have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.181" offset="17034888">It involved action on the floor of the House of Representatives in Massachusetts, in Boston where there had been a hope with respect to establishing a new office of notary public in Nantucket and question was raised as to who would be named for the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.432" offset="17135930">The House voted to establish the new office which was undoubtedly a legislative business and then it developed that while other legislative matter was going on and still on the floor of the House, but had an area aside over beside the Speaker's bench, the one Representative came to Mr. Coffin and said, that they were going to name another Mr. Coffin and this Mr. Coffin said, what that criminal?</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.430" offset="17307920">And don't you know that he was involved in that bank robbery down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4314.961" offset="17334042">Now it is perfectly true that Coffin against Coffin is regarded and rightly regarded as one of the leading cases in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4325.783" offset="17377301">Again it is written by theosophical persons, the then Chief Justice, all the other judges were well known Massachusetts figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4337.841" offset="17425471">There is a long discussion of speech or debate, but the result of the case is that Mr. Coffin was held liable for a judgment of the $2500 which in 1804 was no inconsiderable amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.337" offset="17487538">Because the Court held that this matter happening on the floor of the House but to decide and after the vote had actually been taken did not relate to a speech or debate in either House.</text>

            <text syncTime="4419.151" offset="17750748">Certainly, the Congress should have great power to legislate with respect to its own activities, not merely power to protect, but I think also power to put out, that is power to say the contempts of Congress shall be tried in the Courts as has been the practice for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.074" offset="17838415">I think without meaning to argue another case that Congress can provide that crimes committed by Congressman can be tried in the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4453.718" offset="17888988">So, I think that quite an argument can be made that not because of any express power, but something arising out of what Chief Justice Marshall said it is a constitution we are expounding.</text>

            <text syncTime="4996.394" offset="20059763">But it's a rather extensive footnote and I might add that we were limited of the time in which we had to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5001.206" offset="20078989">That was what we got out of the library of Congress called a catalog.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.384" offset="20099678">There were we found out, after the brief had to be submitted, it's footnote 119 which states on page 86.</text>
            <text syncTime="5015.943" offset="20137922">It also covers page 86, that goes on and on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5022.462" offset="20164044">I might add that since then Mr. Chief Justice, we have discovered that every available congressional report is on microfilm in a variety of both private and public sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.458" offset="20224021">And anyone who wishes, can purchase any single report or an entire proceedings of every single Congress from the first Congress through the last Congress, either partly or to some extent through the library of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5054.512" offset="20292253">So it seems really clear from the history of what has happened in this nation that the fact that Senator Gravel went to Beacon Press as opposed to government printing office makes their difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="5066.236" offset="20339065">Indeed the Solicitor General does not argue than it does, either in its brief or here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5071.746" offset="20361112">His position I assume is that had Senator Gravel gone to GPO and his subcommittee chairman said please publish this report and the GPO did publish the report, that nonetheless the grand jury could still conduct the same inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="5105.569" offset="20496426">Well, again Your Honor, the District Court made a finding of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.271" offset="20515234">That finding was that the purpose of the subpoena to Dr. Rodberg was to question Dr. Rodberg with respect to preparation in the conduct of the subcommittee meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="5121.238" offset="20559120">That finding of fact was not appealed Your Honor and is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5126.083" offset="20578451">In the District Court, when the question came up with respect to the subpoena of Mr. Webber, which is the other party that was actually -- the subpoena is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.867" offset="20625576">At Page 128 of the Appendix, the government asserted that the primary purpose for calling Mr. Webber was, if may quote, “I must in fairness conceive that other areas of interest to us are ancillary so to speak or originated from the contact made by the Senator's representatives.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.373" offset="20707600">The basic purpose that they wished to question Dr. Webber as they stated in the District Court was about the conversations that Dr. Webber had with Senator Gravel and with his aides with respect to the publication of the subcommittee transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.553" offset="20768413">It was not with respect to acquisitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.687" offset="20776877">Those were the findings of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.710" offset="20788998">So I don't think that the government at this late date can come to this Court and say really we are only interested in the original theft of the documents.</text>

            <text syncTime="5233.058" offset="21006441">What we maintain and we have maintained throughout this entire proceeding, what the basis of the dispute has been, is to the extent to which the executive may come to this Court and seek its subpoena and contempt powers to inquire into legislative acts, and there as Mr. Justice Rehnquist suggested, we have asserted a testimonial privilege to prohibit inquiry of legislative acts, but only legislative acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5262.801" offset="21125350">All of the examples of the Solicitor General did not involve legislative acts, certainly kidnapping is not a legislative act and we would have no objection to inquiry involving non-legislative acts.</text>
