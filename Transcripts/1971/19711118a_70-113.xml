            <label>Mr. Whitney North Seymour</label>
            <text syncTime="27.215" offset="182511">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.007" offset="189721">I am going to try to reserve a few minutes for reply.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.692" offset="204454">This is a direct appeal from the judgment of the District Court in Detroit holding that the acquisition in 1961 by Ford Motor Company of the spark plug business and the name of the Autolite Company to enable Ford to supply its own needs for original installation of spark plugs and also to supply replacement plugs to others and the acquisition occurred after Ford had been the customer of Champion, a leading company in the business for 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.436" offset="359412">The Court held that the acquisition violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.414" offset="383340">He directed divestiture and then ended seven other extraordinary injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.308" offset="418867">First, he enjoined Ford from going into the business of making spark plugs by internal entry for 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.696" offset="464424">The judgment enjoined Ford from making any plugs under its own name for five years, not marketing any plugs under its own name for five years and required Ford to buy half its requirements for five years from the purchaser of the divested -- the portion divested.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.331" offset="579050">When the case was tried, batteries were also involved, but they dropped out and they are not now involved, that matter having been satisfactory disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.675" offset="624398">Ford challenges the decision of the District Court as to the violation and submits that even if there was a violation, divestiture in this case was not the best remedy because other remedies which I will mention were better and challenges all the extraordinary injunctions with particular weight on the injunction against the internal entry and the injunction against the use of the Ford name which it regards as definitely anticompetitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.516" offset="775699">Now, I think it is important to understand the nature of this industry because as in other cases, the impact of Section 7 depends on the nature of the industry in a particular situation involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.864" offset="833169">General Motors has made its own spark plugs since 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.239" offset="866606">In that year, it acquired the then Champion spark plug business and had since marketed its spark plug under the name of AC, under the letters AC and at the time of the acquisition, General Motors had 30% of the spark plug market.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.970" offset="937554">When I say the spark plug market, I am talking for the most part about the, not the original installations but the market, in the so-called after-market, the replacement plugs, that is where the large amount of the plug business is done.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.114" offset="1006099">Champion went back into the spark plug business after selling to General Motors and has supplied or had at the time of that acquisition, supplied Ford for 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.607" offset="1056150">And in 1936, Autolite came into the business and began to supply Chrysler and Champion got 50% of the business, it had 50% of the business at the time of the acquisition, that is General Motors 30, Champion 50, and Autolite about 15, and the balance of few percent was sort of -- were spread among small manufactures mostly in the private brand market.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.540" offset="1203794">Now, the private brand market is the market served by such companies as Sears, Roebuck, and Montgomery Ward and other mass merchandisers and some of the oil companies who market spark plugs under their own trade names.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.950" offset="1265443">In 1960 to 1961, in those years, Chrysler got very concerned, I mean, Autolite got very concerned because it saw signs that Chrysler might be getting ready to go into the spark plug business itself and that might leave it with an expensive plant which the Court described, below described as a potential albatross if it could not do something about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.463" offset="1383517">And so it came to Ford and offered to sell the spark plug business to Ford and the Autolite name for spark plugs and other uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.138" offset="1434194">And they worked out a deal under which Ford brought this assets including the battery assets which are no longer involved for a total of $28 million and Autolite became Eltra.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.036" offset="1493858">So that there was a new company with a name of Eltra created which carried on the portion of the business not sold by Autolite to Ford and Eltra has built a spark plug plant in Alabama and is in the business of supplying spark plugs largely for the private brand market.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.556" offset="1591869">Ford, in connection with the sale agreed to buy 12 million plugs from Eltra over a period of two years and also to provide it with certain ceramic parts and thereupon Ford was in the business under the Autolite name.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.905" offset="1677342">Champion became Chrysler’s supplier and took part of -- a large part of the year to change over from Champion plugs to Autolite plugs and worked out the technical difficulties involved and also to begin the process of improving the distribution systems and it took about the same for Chrysler to get started with its new supplier, Champion.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.917" offset="1805342">At the time of the acquisition or just before the acquisition, Ford had some 14% of the spark plug business and after the acquisition, Ford's percentage gradually came up and Champion’s went down and General Motor’s remained about the same, although it has gone up a little bit.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="458.945" offset="1909414">What was the Champion figure?</text>

            <label>Mr. Whitney North Seymour</label>
            <text syncTime="460.444" offset="1915474">The Champion figure originally was 50% at the time of the acquisition.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="465.439" offset="1935432">In 1961?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="whitney_north_seymour" startTime="466.568" stopTime="776.669">
            <label>Mr. Whitney North Seymour</label>
            <text syncTime="466.568" offset="1939925">Yes, 1960-1961, just before the acquisition and Ford’s was 30 and Autolite was about 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.934" offset="1981407">And when Ford came in, the Autolite business began to go up so that by -- about 19 -- in the late 1960s, Ford’s business was up to about 19% and Champion’s business had come down from 50 to about 40 and General Motors had remained about the same, perhaps gone up a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.099" offset="2082031">It is not correct as the Government suggests that this was all automatic, that all happened was that the Champions business went down and the Autolite business went up and Chrysler was changing suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.697" offset="2144516">There was active and intense competition in the after-market and it was a result of that competition that these changes and percentages took place through, it seemed like relatively small changes in percentage but each percentage point was about 4 million plugs and it is a substantial amount of business where involving thousands and thousands of transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.811" offset="2256947">The -- I think Your Honors will be satisfied when I finish describing the industry that historically there have been, since 1936, only three major suppliers to the automobile companies and that before that, there were only two and that the business does not accommodate itself to more than three major suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.612" offset="2364153">There is this private market business, but inevidently there are in this business I think there is room only for three major suppliers and that is because of the special nature of the plug in the business which are not joined to.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.346" offset="2431027">Without going into any detail of the mechanics, the spark plug is a small but essential part of an automobile and the truck and also used in tractors and long-horse and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.385" offset="2483272">It has, as you know two electrodes.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.181" offset="2498423">It is inserted in the cylinder to jump a spark caused by power from the generator to ignite the mixture of oil and gasoline and air in the cylinder and cause the explosion which drives the engine.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.410" offset="2567281">The plugs are carefully engineered to particular mix and models.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.736" offset="2592673">It takes the plug manufacturers and the automobile manufacturers work closely together over a long period of time to get just the right form and construction of the plug and to make it deal most effectively with the particular model for which it is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.921" offset="2669368">Just as an example, I think Ford now makes some 80 different motors and has 80 different plugs for those motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.720" offset="2708552">The use of the wrong plug can cause malfunctioning, affect the exhaust fumes from the engine and could cause serious damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.634" offset="2768215">Now, the plugs are installed at the factory in what is called OE Installation, that is Original Equipment Installation and the automobile manufacturer buys or makes these plugs and they are put in the car and then the car is sold and about 18 months after the car is sold, the average kind of owner goes around and gets a tune up and has a replacement of the plugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.819" offset="2896947">And the plugs are replaced about five times during the use of the average automobile and that means that on a six-cylinder car, there are 30 plugs that are bought over that period, on eight-cylinder 40 plugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.014" offset="2957760">The facts I am stating I think there is no dispute about -- were at one about, think the nature of the market and the facts about the market and indeed many of them are stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.243" offset="3010632">Most replacement plugs are inserted by mechanics in the course of a tune-up.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.165" offset="3038321">One does not ordinarily take his car around and says, I need a new spark plug, but usually he is going to a garage or a service station or some other place to have the car tuned-up and gone over and at that time that the mechanic ordinarily inserts the new plugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.768" offset="3112718">And the new plugs are such a minor part of the cost of that operation that really price and cost of the plugs to the customer are no moment so that there is little if any price competition at that level.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.312" offset="3174890">The mechanic --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="776.669" offset="3180323">Well, the customer does not really choose either?</text>
            <text syncTime="779.848" offset="3193071">It is the mechanic that probably chooses what plugs to put in?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="whitney_north_seymour" startTime="783.178" stopTime="890.732">
            <label>Mr. Whitney North Seymour</label>
            <text syncTime="783.178" offset="3206446">That is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.498" offset="3211670">The mechanic on the basis of his experience and knowledge ordinarily makes the choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.212" offset="3238524">Now, he chooses the plug which ordinarily, the plug which was originally installed.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.550" offset="3275931">This propensity of mechanics to use the plug originally installed is called in this record sometimes the OE type which merely means the propensity of mechanics to use the same plug in replacement that was there originally and he does this because he knows about the fact that the plug was originally designed for that car and he does not want to take into risk about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.002" offset="3373734">He does not want to think that he is smarter than the engineering department that designed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.029" offset="3397766">Now, there are all purpose plugs manufactured by all of these companies and the average garage man or service station man stocks some of the plugs, but usually not all the plugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.034" offset="3469864">Usually, if the record shows that sometimes the garage owner or the filling station owner has only the AC plug or sometimes the Champion plug, but usually both of those because they are so popular and then at the time of this acquisition, probably few of these places also stock the Autolite plugs and one of the great efforts here in the competitive struggle has been to get more and more of these places to stock the Autolite plug.</text>

            <text syncTime="916.006" offset="3737672">And then if as you tell us it was the habit or practice of mechanics to install as replacement plugs, the original equipment plugs, why would they have stocked all three just in the ordinary course of business because of the so-called big three automobiles?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="whitney_north_seymour" startTime="933.886" stopTime="1034.181">
            <label>Mr. Whitney North Seymour</label>
            <text syncTime="933.886" offset="3809247">Well, generally speaking there are perhaps two reasons as far as the Autolite plug and the Ford Champion plug to take that first.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.491" offset="3851670">Ford, tried to distribute these plugs through its franchise dealers and the franchise dealers were no longer handling at or about the time of the acquisition as many of the installations as the filling stations and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.354" offset="3915095">And the filling station proprietors and the garage proprietors were concerned about not having too large an inventory and actually they would maintain an inventory which would do the best job in supplying plugs for the largest possible number without too much of an investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.332" offset="3979043">So there was a tendency to have a major lines and the Autolite line had difficulty getting in as indicated by the fact that between about the time of the acquisition in the late 1960s, the percentage of Ford sales in the aftermarket crept up some 5% which I think is represented by the increase stocking of these plugs in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.071" offset="4085936">Now, the -- I mentioned the all purpose plug, all these companies make all purpose plugs so that if the mechanic does not have the OE plug at the time, he can try to do the best he can by using an all purpose plug which is a sort of a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.555" offset="4167856">It is not as good as many people think as the OE plug, but it is better than a plug that was made for a wholly different kind of a car and that is a kind of compromise solution.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="1034.181" stopTime="1046.925">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1034.181" offset="4210384">Did I read somewhere in the record that there have been testimony to the effect that most of the filling stations did not appear to want to carry more than two different brands?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="whitney_north_seymour" startTime="1046.925" stopTime="1414.860">
            <label>Mr. Whitney North Seymour</label>
            <text syncTime="1046.925" offset="4261375">That was so for a long time and the business are trying to get them to carry three took a lot of effort and that is what went off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.599" offset="4288124">Now, the OE use is of such importance to the manufacturer that Champion, beginning in 1920, started what is now as the six cent OE price, it began to sell the plugs for original installation at 6 cents and then everybody -- all the manufacturers followed soon so that all the plugs were original equipment installation were sold at 6 cents and the cost of the plugs was three or four times as much as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.845" offset="4433051">So that the manufacturer used this low OE price to get in and get the business and then he had to make up for the loss on that sale by a higher price on the sales for the aftermarket, the replacement plugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.284" offset="4502850">And so this is a very important part of the getting into the business and holding the business and is a fact of life which is unusual in this industry I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.331" offset="4551020">The -- I have already mentioned the fact that because of the fact that the plugs are originally installed as part of other work, that their prices of little or no moment and this and one of the reasons of the price in the business has been so stable is that in 1953, all of the plug manufacturers had cases before the Federal Trade Commission which involved the question of whether they could distinguish in price between the various types of distributors who distributed their plugs including the other companies who wanted to distribute their plugs and the Federal Trade Commission held that they had to give the same price to everybody in the distribution chain and this has naturally kept the plug manufacturers from lowering their price because if they did, they had to do it to everybody and therefore they could not do it in the ordinary competitive way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.813" offset="4812976">The court below regarded one of the important factors as to whether or not the Champion or the Ford’s relation to Champion tended to moderate Champion’s price and he held that it did and it was his view that somehow Ford being a large customer of Champion, moderated Champion’s price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.468" offset="4943588">Now, on this record that is just a theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.971" offset="4961561">There was no proof and there is nothing in this record to show that there was any such moderation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.813" offset="4988937">I would take it that the original equipment price given 50 years ago is hardly a moderation which should still persist in any realistic sense at the time of the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.163" offset="5038361">It was really not a moderation that was a sort of a payment for entrance or an arrangement for entrance and aside from that the record does not show any moderation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.230" offset="5082560">Ford had to pay a higher price in 1959 and 1960 for its plugs than other people did and there is not any evidence of moderation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.361" offset="5131148">The suggestion is made that the Court examined this carefully that Ford was a potential competitor and that under Penn-Olin, somehow this acquisition was bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.578" offset="5207948">Now, the Court took testimony and the government tried very hard to try to show that Ford was on the verge of entering this business, but the evidence the Court found did not show that Ford was on the brink of entering this business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.095" offset="5278060">There are certain memoranda in the record which indicate that there was a study made to that subject, several studies but they never reached the point of top level consideration and the reason they did not was that, and the testimony of Mr. Duffy in the record which the Court accepted, was that plugs were available to Ford for OE Installation at one-third of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.358" offset="5399164">Ford did not have at that time any engineers who were expert in the plug business or even in the ceramic business that they had no distribution system which was adequate at that time to enable them to compete effectively in the aftermarket and then the undisputed evidence is and the Court recognized it and everybody recognized it, that after an original OE installation of a new plug, it takes five to eight years to have enough vehicles on the road with that plug in them to really do a lot of business in the aftermarket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.000" offset="5573662">And so anybody going into the plug business has a major manufacturer had to face all these difficulties, the problem of five to eight years before he can really realize on the aftermarket.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.372" offset="5639177">The problem of the loss which was involved in connection with getting -- having something other than the six-cent price, the problem of working out to technicalities and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.196" offset="5694452">So, it is clear I think that Ford was not a potential competitor and the Court did not conclude that it was.</text>

            <label>Mr. Whitney North Seymour</label>
            <text syncTime="1441.668" offset="5840320">Now, I want to move along, I have spent more time over the industry than I intended to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.715" offset="5864561">The Court pointed out I think that Ford considered that making this acquisition would enable it to get into the business and compete effectively and that expectation was real honest because of the competition has increased since Ford made this acquisition and it is perfectly clear that it was not just a slipping around of percentages, but it was a genuine increase in competition in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.889" offset="6025267">This acquisition we submit was pro-competitive because it made Ford a -- Ford was a stronger and more effective competitor than Autolite had been, where there were three companies before the acquisition, the creation of Eltra after the -- in connection with the acquisition, a company which is now an effective competitor in the private brand market and the fact that Champion having lost a portion of its interest and its sales in the aftermarket has had to become a more effective and competitor in the private brand market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.342" offset="6179076">All, I submit are contributions to competition and so we submit that it was a pro-competitive acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.221" offset="6214602">Now the court below, as I have suggested, regarded the fact that although Ford was not a potential entrant, it still moderated Champion’s price and also the fact that the acquisition somehow foreclosed competition and perhaps also increased barriers to entry as a ground upon which it decided the Section 7 case adversely to Ford.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.496" offset="6347618">Now, as I have said, there is no evidence in this record of moderation of Champions’ prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.747" offset="6372695">There is no foreclosure of anybody, but Champion, and Champion has had to simply get out and compete in a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.130" offset="6422224">This is not a case like Brown Shoe where there were sales being made by competitors in the market and such sales would have gone on, but for the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.656" offset="6464333">It is not a case like many of your cases on potential competition where a potential competitor was acquired and absorbed and there was no substitute as there was here for the absorption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.144" offset="6518250">Here, the acquisition gave rise to a stronger competitor and as far as barriers to entry is concerned, I hope I have made clear that any company seeking to go into the making of spark plugs for use in automobiles had to face the barriers to entry which were inherent in the business, that is they had to sell at low price, at a loss, they had to make up that loss over a period of years through the replacement market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.713" offset="6660565">They could not get into the replacement market for a five to eight years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.521" offset="6675820">They had to workout all kinds of technical difficulties in arriving at the thing, so that really, the idea that little companies were in a position that come knocking on the door and get the business is just a concept of unnecessary charade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.478" offset="6743634">It would just be a charade to suggest that the small manufacturers were in a position to come in and get that business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.239" offset="6774668">Now Champion, if this transaction had not taken place, it seems clear on this record that what would have happened would be, the Champion would have continued as it had for 50 years to be Ford’s supplier and the market would have been just what it was before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.878" offset="6849169">Instead of that, the market has become more competitive as a result of Ford’s activity in it and the creation of Eltra as a real competitor and the fact that Champion has to scramble out for business by competing in the private brand market, all are contributions to competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1746.332" offset="7058984">Now, I must come to the problem of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.483" offset="7079569">Let me just, before I come to that, I really think that the Government’s position and the Court’s position here was without any kind of sub silentio treatment that Ford being a large customer must as a matter of law be regarded as having somehow moderated without regard to the facts and thus that any acquisition involving such a large customer must be regarded as per se illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.715" offset="7200568">The Court does not use those words, but I think that is the necessary implication and I submit that they are quite enough per se rules now without having one in this field and further more it would be very unsound indeed to treat a customer in the same position as one as Your Honor said in Penn-Olin, waiting anxiously on the edge of the market to come in now on relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.119" offset="7294191">If I have satisfied Your Honors that there is no violation, that is the end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.780" offset="7324806">If Your Honors think, as far as we are concerned, if Your Honors think that there was a violation, we submit that divestiture in this case was an improper remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.133" offset="7366184">We know that divestiture is usually the remedy, but Your Honors have laid it down that it is not an execrably the remedy and here the effect of divestiture as we shown in our brief would have been one or two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.479" offset="7415608">Either after all the effort involved in divestiture, all that would have happened would have been that the New Fostoria, the purchaser would have become tied before just as the old company had, just as Champion had been the market would have been just as it was before and all the advantages, the pro-competitive advantage of this acquisition would have been lost and the alternative to that which is perhaps still worse is that after the five years during which Ford had to take half of its requirements from New Fostoria, the company would not have been able to market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.730" offset="7568581">Somehow it would have lost its markets and it would have failed and then the whole thing would have gone for naught, a great economic loss to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.670" offset="7600346">Now, let me leave that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.806" offset="7608914">Ford made a proposal which I think really was in this setting far more fruitful than divestiture and that was that for 10 years, it should buy 30 million plugs from Eltra.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.647" offset="7676310">Eltra then had the capacity of about 20 million plugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.387" offset="7691252">Annual purchases of 30 million would have put Eltra in the position to sell 50 or more million a year and made it an effective competitor and that relief in lieu of divestiture would have done more to improve the competitive situation than divestiture would have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.637" offset="7764186">Let me come to the injunctions because these are things which I have a deep concern and I have not left myself any time to talk about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.377" offset="7795219">The injunction which the Court granted, forbidding Ford by internal entry to go into manufacture for 10 years is absolutely unprecedented as far as I know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.516" offset="7839732">It is clearly anticompetitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.032" offset="7849763">Its effect would be to deprive Ford of a right that everybody else has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.946" offset="7865437">The General Motors had an exercise and there is absolutely no reason except some back-handed penalty or any such harsh injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.729" offset="7908591">My learned friend says, well, it would take Ford awhile to get into the business and it was trying to go into the business anyhow, that does not take away I think from the error in the court below in granting such a sweeping, unprecedented and unjustified injunction and in the same category is the injunction against Ford using its own name after four or five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.832" offset="8017051">That means that Ford would have to buy not only half its plugs from Eltra or from New Fostoria, but would have to buy the rest of its plugs from somebody else under that person’s trade name and not use the Ford name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.420" offset="8071386">So that Ford would be forbidden from really beginning to edge into this market under its own name for a long period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.837" offset="8105032">There is no precedent for any such relief as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.136" offset="8118197">It is unnecessary and clearly anticompetitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.585" offset="8131990">Now, I will not argue with the requirements contract which is the third injunction because in my own view if divestiture was proper or if there was a violation in divestiture and it was proper, that injunction may have been useful in implementing the divestiture and ensuring the divested company of business for a period of time and while it is unusual and I think unnecessary, I will not press that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.737" offset="8232614">But it seems to me, the other two injunctions whatever Your Honor does -- whatever Your Honors do with divestiture and violation are clearly erroneous and the decree should be reversed on that ground alone, but our view is that it should be reversed across the board.</text>

            <text syncTime="2062.850" offset="8325087">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.128" offset="8338148">Section 7 of the Clayton Act, of course deals with the probabilities not with certainties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.542" offset="8359882">The statutory standard is that acquisitions are condemned whose effect maybe, maybe substantially to less the composition and as this Court has stated and as the legislative history indicates all that is required is that there be a reasonable probability of anticompetitive effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.485" offset="8439608">And in the Philadelphia Bank opinion, this Court stated that a determination of whether there is such a reasonable probability of anticompetitive effect as it said requires not merely an appraisal of the immediate impact of the merger upon competition, but a prediction of its impact upon competitive conditions in the future and also added that a prediction as to the future impact is sound only if it is based upon a firm understanding of the structure of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.975" offset="8569593">That is the impact of Section 7 is to prevent anticompetitive changes in the structure of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.376" offset="8603239">The way the market operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.291" offset="8610867">Now, there is no question about the market in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.234" offset="8622570">It is one of the most concentrated markets that we can find.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.351" offset="8639079">For more than 20 years, the three leading firms that had between 90 and 95% of the market, in most instances closer to 95 and that condition is continued since the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.057" offset="8697907">There are also as Mr. Seymour has indicated high entry barriers in this market primarily because of the fact that due to the OE tie, a manufacturer finds it almost impossible to get into the lucrative replacement market unless he has the OE tie and you cannot get the OE tie unless the you can get the business of one of the major automobile manufacturer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2544.089" offset="10249998">Basically, it is an attempt, four to ten years has had the benefits of the ownership of Electric Autolite.</text>

            <text syncTime="2559.297" offset="10310916">It acquired Autolite’s entire distribution system, it is entry for these warehouse distributors who are so important and penetrating into the aftermarket and the purpose of a ten-year provision in effect is to put the thing back, put the thing back the way it was before that once again Ford to be a customer, there will be a large independent manufacturer and to give this large company the opportunity to begin to develop because if I may just say one other thing on that Mr. Justice, if Ford were permitted to go into manufacture immediately, the likely first -- the likely thing that will happen would be this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.969" offset="10469531">And of course, I mentioned that the provisions of the decree are all interrelated because if Ford were permitted to go into manufacture itself and there was no ban on the use of Ford’s name or even with the present thing, what probably would happen is Ford would purchase its 50% requirements from divested plant and put those plugs into the aftermarket to sell for the replacement of the Ford plugs that are ready on the road and would begin manufacturing under its own name and selling under its own name and by in a very short period, after five or six years when the market for the replacement plugs was exhausted, this new company would find itself with no basis at all, It could not -- it would have no OE tie because Ford itself would be using its own brand on the plugs and it would be left to kind of floundering if this is the word trying to break into the aftermarket and this is designed, this provision and all of the provisions of the decree are designed to give the new company an opportunity to get a foothold at least in the market to try to restore as much as possible the market structure that existed before the acquisition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2712.810" offset="10924898">It is obviously going to be under pressure as a result of this decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.428" offset="10939422">First to try to gain all of Ford’s business in the initial five years, and not just the 50% and indicates the business after the fiver years, it does not know however whet is going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.846" offset="10985084">Conceivably after five years, Ford may take its business elsewhere or after 10 years, Ford may decide to manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.262" offset="11010684">So, I think what is likely to happen is from the very outset the new Fostoria is going to do two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.652" offset="11036284">One, it is going to do everything it can to try to satisfy Ford in terms of quality, in terms of fair price, and etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.839" offset="11065019">Secondly, it is going to be aware of the fact that at the end of five years it has no assured market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.389" offset="11087275">It may have to start fighting at this point in the aftermarket, and therefore, it seems to me in the initial five-year period, the new company is going to do everything it can to try to build its business in the aftermarket.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.408" offset="11139311">And if it is going to be building its business and competing vigorously in the aftermarket, I presume that Chrysler and General Motors will also feel the impetuous to compete vigorously in the aftermarket.</text>

            <text syncTime="3573.753" offset="14368673">And the impact of course of this foreclosure was even greater because of the fact that GM which made approximately 50% of the cost had in fact preempted almost 50%, 45% at that time of the OE market and thus the OE -- and this closed off, this big share of the OE market and when Ford applied its share of the market, there was a foreclosure of a greater share of the OE market in the actual 10% show.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.448" offset="14515481">Now, Ford’s answer to this, to this foreclosure point as saying, well, it was really know significant foreclosure here because the market was really tied up with Champion.</text>

            <text syncTime="4418.046" offset="17745887">You have a market comparable to what you had before, not exactly, but you would have a comparable market with two significant independent spark plug manufacturers and only one of the big three automobile companies engaged in the manufacture of spark plugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.174" offset="17814433">The -- our economist indicated that the only real hope of ultimately achieving deconcentration in this market and I just paused to point out that in a market of this type, an oligopolistic, very tightly structured market with high barriers to entry, no price competition, it is vital that we do everything in the hope of procuring deconcentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.928" offset="17937417">Every step that may lead to deconcentration, may lead to more vigorous competition should be incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="4471.945" offset="17961450">The only hope of any real deconcentration in this market is breaking the OE tie.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.069" offset="17986005">That is trying to persuade the automobile mechanics that really they do not have to use the original equipment plug.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.083" offset="18022054">Now, Mr. Seymour suggested that while you have these all purpose plugs, they are really not quite as good.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.350" offset="18063118">The average service station or a garage has charts would show substitutability of plugs and it is interesting thing that Ford’s own witness testified that he recognized that the plugs that Ford makes, they all make -- all three of them, Champion, Ford, and General Motors that is Autolite, make all purpose plugs and he testifies that well he thought that the Ford plugs would do just as good a job as the Champion in the AC plugs that were original equipment in Chrysler and General Motors cars and he was asked and he said I suppose you would have to acknowledge that the Champion in AC plugs that is a substitute for your plugs will do just as well, and he said well yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.130" offset="18258201">Evidence for example shows that Ford was much elated when they discovered few years ago that at some trials, automotive trials down in Florida, all the people who were driving the Stop Pontiac (ph) automobiles were using electric Autolite spark plugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4562.824" offset="18324970">They said, this just shows how good our plugs are and the indication is that the real hope, the real hope of any deconcentration in this market is to break the OE tie and to persuade people that they do not have to buy the original equipment plug if the other plug would have -- and of course, there is going to be an automobile manufacturer owning a spark plug firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.540" offset="18423817">It is going to be much less likely to be pushing the sales of the private brands in the aftermarket than an independent, who -- particularly this independent, the divested company that knows its ultimate future may depend on success in penetrating into the aftermarket.</text>
            <text syncTime="4614.200" offset="18530501">Now, Ford complains about the requirement that it purchased its half of its need from Autolite because it says, this is going to cause also some problems in terms of pollution control, that we will not have adequate control over the quality of the plugs and this is going to be very unfortunate that we can do a much better job ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="4638.735" offset="18628617">Well, first of all, the decree says that Ford in purchasing the half of its requirements from Autolite under Autolite’s name that the product must conform to Ford’s designs, specifications, quality standards and delivery requirements and to be priced competitively.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.289" offset="18706880">So that Ford is protected because the decree does guarantee it and the requirements are contingent on the plugs meeting those standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.628" offset="18744183">Moreover, as I have indicated the divested company will be under very great pressure to satisfy Ford, both in the hope of getting more than 50% of the business and in the hope of retaining that business after the five years.</text>

            <text syncTime="4742.181" offset="19042397">It seems that Ford for 50 years was fully satisfied with the product it was getting from Champion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.513" offset="19071758">Even today, Chrysler has not thus far attempted to integrate and there is no indication that Chrysler is not getting satisfactory quality and there is not -- no indication that Chrysler is not able.</text>
            <text syncTime="4763.338" offset="19127033">If I may, Mr. Justice I would like to just close with one thought if I may which is, on the question of the use of Ford’s own trade name on plugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.469" offset="19167575">Ford makes the point that this is a harsh remedy, that it is a penalty, that it is unfair, that it is unnecessary and they say this goes far beyond anything is ever happened here because even prior to the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.602" offset="19232046">Ford was perfectly free at anytime to manufacture under its own trade name and now it its precluded and I think the answer to this contention is something that this Court stated some years ago in Federal Trade Commission v. National Lead Company in 352 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="4808.877" offset="19309159">when the complaint was there made that a decree subjected the defendants to very strict strictures and was unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="4816.769" offset="19340715">The Court said that those “violating the Act” must expect some fencing in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.857" offset="19361090">I think Ford here has violated the Act through this acquisition and it too must expect some fencing in.</text>

            <label>Mr. Whitney North Seymour</label>
            <text syncTime="4832.803" offset="19404872">I would just take a moment or two in the colloquy that developed the basic question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4840.357" offset="19435069">Did this acquisition substantially lessen competition or have the probability of doing so and I submit that it is amply clear that not only did it not lessen the competition or eliminate any competitor, it added competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.161" offset="19510302">It aided competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.559" offset="19515944">It promoted competition and what Mr. Friedman has told Your Honors, points that up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.974" offset="19541544">Chrysler and Champion are in a more competitive relationship than when Champion did not have these grounds for business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.143" offset="19574250">Champion is also in the aftermarket, in the private brand market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.520" offset="19595775">Eltra which is the fourth company in the business and if this divestiture took place, there would still only be four.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.713" offset="19624509">There would not be a new company because New Fostoria would just take the place of Ford as a supplier, but the result of this acquisition was to create a fourth competitor and that is Eltra which is active in the private brand market where it is competing actively with Champion, still the biggest company in the business or having the largest franchise of that kind of business, and Eltra sales and in the last figures in the record for 17 million plugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4917.813" offset="19744986">Now, that is not very much compared with the sales of General Motors and others, but it is coming up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.198" offset="19766511">Eltra’s President testified that he expected the market by 1980 to be around 150 million plugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.882" offset="19793260">This is a contribution to competition now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.769" offset="19800784">Now, let me explain the way this private brand market works as I understand it in connection with automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4937.634" offset="19824189">The mass merchandisers have put in repair bases in many of their retail outlets in suburbs and so on and you come in to shop at Sears Roebuck, you pull your car in there and get them to tune it up and unless you tell them, that what you want is an AC plug, what they do is to put on a series plug and so this business of overcoming the OE tie by direction of the guy that runs the station is what happens in connection with these private brand sales and apparently it is having a monopoly scale so it is getting to be a more significant part of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.457" offset="19967549">Now, I submit that this was a pro-competitive activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4976.778" offset="19980819">If that so, that ends the case and the judge had to struggle so hard to get away from the inference and I must say it was clear in 1969 and it was when the government brought the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4988.391" offset="20027213">In 1961, it may have looked less pro-competitive than it turned out to be, but the judge had or really take this concept of being on the edge of the market, but he transposed the notion of being on the edge of the market from your potential completion decisions to a mere customer status where I submit it does not have any place or customer is always on the edge of the market, but it is not on the edge of the market as one anxiously waiting to come in which is what your case deals with.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.071" offset="20153959">My learned friend said that Champion was -- might have lost the business before nibbling at it, but Champion showed no signs of concern in the testimony, including the testimony quoted in our reply brief shows that Champion was not worried about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5036.091" offset="20218011">It felt that it would go on forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.862" offset="20225117">That is the way it had been and Chrysler had some inquiries, but nobody ever made a bid to Chrysler and so when you talk about it, when the judge talks about the terrible thing being in the denial of the opportunity to try, this is really test as I said before a charade.</text>
            <text syncTime="5054.013" offset="20289691">It is not a real effort and it is really not open to people to come in and make the sacrifice involved and selling below cost and waiting eight years to draw out the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5064.959" offset="20333473">Now finally, the -- it is clear from counsel’s argument I think and I think from the opinion on relief that the Court below really was concerned about the OE tie and was trying to find a way to break it and he thought that it was the divestiture in holding Ford’s head underwater with these injunctions maybe something would happen to break the tie.</text>
            <text syncTime="5093.254" offset="20446739">But quite aside from the fact that that was a judicial experiment which is beyond I submit, the ordinary activities that are proper under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5105.332" offset="20495014">There is no prospect of breaking it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.260" offset="20502746">The prospect of breaking it is by competition and competition was encouraged by this transaction and thus one word on the injunctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.721" offset="20536601">Counsel says it took 10 years to get the judgment in this case, and therefore, Ford should be banned for 10 years from entering the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.371" offset="20571187">I submit that that does not follow at all and that be banned at all from entering the market was anticompetitive and there is no basis for it and as far as Ford’s name is concerned to deny it an opportunity to even lay the basis for ultimate entry in the market for many, many years by preventing it from letting its name be connected with spark plugs made by others is quite wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="5147.272" offset="20662824">And aside from everything else those injunctions were excessive beyond I think any proper exercise of the Court’s discretion, but basically my view is that this was a pro-competitive acquisition and the judgment should be reversed.</text>
