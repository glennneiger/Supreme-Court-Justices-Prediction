            <text syncTime="214.606" offset="932127">Connecticut appears to be the only State in which an alleged creditor and his attorney are permitted in their absolute discretion to levy and maintain a garnishment until final disposition of the creditor suit without any involvement of the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.028" offset="1001821">Most other states require the creditor to get some sort of court approval before garnishment either in the form of posting a bond, filing an affidavit and so far as we know in all other states, the writ of garnishment must be signed or issued by a judge or clerk of court.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.741" offset="1148630">If the debtor claims that the garnishment was levied without any probable validity, that the creditors claim has no merit or that there was no necessity for a garnishment as in Mrs. Lynch’s and Mrs. Toro’s case for example, where we alleged that there were Connecticut wage earners raising a family in Connecticut, steadily employed, no grounds as in Minnesota for example, where garnishment is permitted only where there maybe some danger that a debtor may escape from the jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="512.532" offset="2123833">A debtor in order to raise these issues must institute separate proceedings pursuant to specific statutes by serving process upon the creditor or his attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.186" offset="2174406">Now, he can complain that the garnishment unreasonably exceeds the amount that the creditor himself claims as damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.786" offset="2208887">But the Court, the State Court has no ability, no power to inquire into the probable validity of the creditor’s claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.794" offset="2252878">The only inquiry is directed to what the amount of the creditor’s claim is.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.631" offset="2276179">In Mrs. Lynch’s case and a suit on a note, it is very clear what the creditor’s claim is, the garnishment does not exceed the amount which the creditor claims as damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.153" offset="2314318">Therefore, Mrs. Lynch cannot make use of that statute, neither could Mrs. Toro for the same reason before her garnishment was released.</text>

            <text syncTime="687.986" offset="2825586">In Connecticut there is a statute, Section 337 (a) of Title 52, which requires a court order for garnishment of checking accounts to the extent if they exceed $5,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.181" offset="2882429">The grounds upon which in order to an issue are set out on that statute in parallel seriously and very closely, the procedure in a number of other states, the alleged creditor must make some showing that the debtor is about to abscond, avoid service of process, or conceal his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.656" offset="2968319">But those protections are not available to low income wage earners.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.576" offset="2996009">The Three-Judge Court in this case dismissed the complaints on motions to dismiss on two grounds: First, relying on the Second Circuit decision in Eisen against Eastman, the Three-Judge Court held that it lack subject matter jurisdiction under Section 1343, subsection three of Title 28, on the ground that utmost the wage earners had alleged an unconstitutional deprivation, a substantial question of an unconstitutional deprivation of their property valued at less than $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.176" offset="3146370">Its second ground, despite its recognition that summary garnishments are levied without any Court involvement was that Title 28 Section 2283, the anti-injunction statute barred a relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.605" offset="3200078">Now the rule that we are contending for with respect to the jurisdiction point and we think that this rule follows directly from this Court decisions in Monroe versus Pape ten years ago, is that whenever a natural person alleges a not insubstantial deprivation of his Fourteenth Amendment rights under the color of state law, Sections 1983 and 1343 are satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.016" offset="3305717">Now I say natural person, Mr. Justice Blackmun, I do not think that this case needs to go so far as to hold the General Motors or a corporation has a right of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="850.724" offset="3476558">The rule which we are proposing that this Court hold in this case is that Sections 1983 and 1343 be satisfied by allegations of Fourteenth Amendment deprivations by persons acting in the color of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.003" offset="3545730">We believe that this rule is fully supported.</text>

            <text syncTime="952.437" offset="3883441">The Connecticut Supreme Court said more than 50 years ago in the case of Sachs against Nussenbaum which we have cited in our brief and reply brief that the release of a garnishment has no effect upon the pending creditor’s civil suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.280" offset="3958778">No State Court interests and adjudication would the affected by holding that the garnishments in these cases are not proceedings in a State Court, because they are not under the control of the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.968" offset="4013531">We do not believe that in this case, this Court need reach the question of whether Section 1983 is an expressly authorized exemption to Section 2283, even though we feel that in these cases we have shown through our briefs that the wage earners have no redress in the State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.118" offset="4094197">And I would refer the Court to the case of Michael's Jewelers against Handy cited in our brief in which after the SNIADACH decision a low income debtor challenge the very statute, Title 52 Section 329, under which the garnishments in this cases were levied on the ground that they deprive to have notice and hearing, procedural due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1196.008" offset="4857704">It seems to us that a reading of it will indicate that the Three-Judge Court did not hold summary garnishments to be proceedings in the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.678" offset="4892394">The way we read the opinion Mr. Justice is that the Three-Judge Court felt that enjoin -- that releasing garnishments would probably interfere with the existing creditor’s suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.649" offset="4936280">This was on motions to dismiss and additionally the Connecticut Supreme Court itself has held in the Sachs case that release does not affect the creditor’s suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.290" offset="4978807">It is an entirely different matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.784" offset="5000855">Finally, as to our 2283 point, we do not believe under any circumstances that Section 2283 would bar an injunction against Connecticut deputy sheriffs from filing future summary garnishments in proceedings, existing creditor’s suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.332" offset="5075043">It is not yet instituted by other creditors of Mrs. Lynch and Mrs. Toro.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.294" offset="5098866">In conclusion, the only question before this Court is whether Congress intended Mrs. Lynch’s and Mrs. Toro’s complaints to be heard in a federal forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.619" offset="5148185">We submit that since they have alleged substantial Fourteenth Amendment violations and that they have no redress in the Courts of Connecticut, there claims must be heard in a Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.551" offset="5195937">We, therefore, ask this Court to reverse the judgment of the Three-Judge Court below and to remand it for resolution of the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1299.553" offset="5271901">I would like to pick up if I may at precisely the point where my Brother Mr. Lesser left off and that is posing the question as to whether Congress intended these claims to have been heard by the Three-Judge District Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.246" offset="5322683">The basic holding of the lower court was that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction under the Section 1343 and that was the basis of its dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.287" offset="5358837">Now, the appellees’ position on the 1343 jurisdictional question rests squarely upon the doctrine annunciated in the Eisen case which in turn goes back to the postulation by Mr. Justice Stone in the Hague decision as to the relation between 1343 and 1331.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.809" offset="5436891">I would like to review that because that is the basis of our position and the basis of the lower court’s dismissal below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.490" offset="5459670">Now the appellants have a direct argument and an appealing argument as to why this is not so and they say basically that the Fourteenth Amendment was enacted with the purpose in mind to protect precisely the kind of right that is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.582" offset="5515990">Further, that Section 1343 and Section 1983, the statute created the cause of action were designed to pick up those constitutional rights and to provide a cause of action and jurisdiction to secure them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.600" offset="5568130">Finally, the appellants say that Section 1331, a $10,000 jurisdictional statute, is to be looked apart -- looked upon as separate and apart from and distinct from the 1343 and 1983 propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.173" offset="5626435">Now, if the matter were as clear as this from the legislative history, the wonder is really that Mr. Justice Stone had to go through its process of reasoning in the Hague decision at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.433" offset="5671470">And the answer must be simply that a selective choice of the legislative history is simply not as clear and not as precise and not as symmetrical as the appellants would have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.795" offset="5720894">I believe that the reason for this really is that what you overlook in establishing that kind of precise intent to a portion of the civil rights legislation is the nature of the process that went on in Congress for the period following the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.459" offset="5779513">In Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s words, “This were years of struggle and of compromise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.100" offset="5798112">And to reduce a portion of the legislative result to clarity and direct us in simplicity overlooks the nature of that struggle and it overlooks the triumphs and the defeats of that compromising process and it overlooks the intensity of the passions that were involved, thus the post Civil War Congress has tried to hammer out in lasting terms what it was that it had torn a country apart for five years during the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.669" offset="5896332">Now, I think it is instructive to review the period that is in question while this legislative history accumulates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.494" offset="5919634">We begin in 1865 with the Thirteenth Amendment itself which the Court’s emancipation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.905" offset="5941263">In 1866, we have the first of the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.217" offset="5958608">That was the act which, among other things, included what is today Section 1983, that statute dealing with equal rights as to ownership and as to disposition of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.232" offset="5998628">And there is evidence from the history as suggested in our brief that 1983 was the keystone of the reconstruction of Congress’ efforts to preserve that kind of property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.702" offset="6036453">In 1868 the Fourteenth Amendment himself, in 1870 there is another Civil Rights Act and the Fifteenth Amendment dealing with voting rights comes in to being.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.823" offset="6073025">In 1871, there are two Civil Rights Act that came on the books and one of them is so called Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 from whence the present day 1983 statute creating a cause of action and the 1343 jurisdictional statute draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.334" offset="6139062">Now, there is evidence in the history that what was a paramount concern of this Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 was the unequal treatment of people, evidenced by the clan activity in the South from whence the act took its name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.129" offset="6194233">The discrimination on the basis of race, the denial of equal opportunities and the denial of the equal applications of the laws in the years following the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.917" offset="6237387">Finally, the last stage in this legislative history in 1875 is the first emergence of Section 1331, the jurisdictional statute which now deals in terms of $10,000, but at the time of the original passage I believe it was a $500 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.712" offset="6296528">There is pause in 1875 and there is a recodification that takes place in that year and some adjustments were made to the statute that had preceded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.062" offset="6329965">For instance, I believe it is at that time that the statement in 1983 dealing with a cause of action based on federal laws as well as the Constitution first comes in to being in 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.452" offset="6379493">The jurisdictional statute 1343 includes at that time a statement with respect to causes of action based on federal laws denying equal rights and expressed records to the kind of equality concerned that it was at the heart of the Civil Rights legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.884" offset="6449188">Now what Mr. Justice Stone’s formulation in Hague case does is set the year 1875 as the point of departure from whence both 1343 and 1331 have existed on the books side by side down to the time of the Hague decision, which was in 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.629" offset="6520241">Excuse me, there was one legislative activity during that period but not of tremendous significance, that was in 1911 recodification when the jurisdiction of the Circuit Courts and the District Court became merged in the District Court and 1343, the jurisdictional statute, preserved the phrase that it has today dealing with jurisdiction to causes under those Federal laws providing for equal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.079" offset="6618043">Now, what Mr. Justice Stone saw from the history that he looked up in its entirety and as a whole were these two parallel statutes: One providing a cause of action under Section 1343 with no monetary allocations or no monetary requirement whatsoever, and the parallel statute 1331 which did in fact have a monetary requirement which is, as I have said before, has been changed throughout during the course of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.800" offset="6720861">Now his analysis led him to believe that 1343, that jurisdictional statute which is at issue in this case, was the one intended to be directed at those causes of actions which were essentially denials of personal rights, and those causes of action based essentially on denial of the equal protection of the law, the discriminatory evils which the reconstruction Congress had noted in the Ku Klux Klan Act and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.708" offset="6828486">1331 on the other hand, according to Mr. Justice Stone’s formulation, was that statute designed to pick up those actions which were essentially of a property nature capable of being measured in monetary amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.247" offset="6878641">Now, in looking back at this history his feel the vision was not entirely uncluttered or unclear because he had the precedents performed in such cases as the Pleasants case, Greenhow and Holt against Indiana which were cases giving some attention to the 1343 question and those cases had started the Court found attack consistent with Mr. Justice Stone’s formulation to the effect that 1343 was a statute dealing with Civil Rights, 1331, the statute dealing with property allegations which were truly property, and did not involve those rights susceptible of being measured in monetary or pecuniary terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.109" offset="7026076">That is the rationale of Mr. Justice, Hague lies and that is the one if it comes to rest in the Second Circuit case involving Eisen which was Judge Friendly’s opinion some 30 years later, I believe in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.008" offset="7077694">Now, in the Eisen decision, Judge Friendly is candid and frank to know the difficulty with the Hague formulation, because it was 30 years previous and also because there was no majority opinion in the case and that Judge Friendly pointed that out in the course of his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.160" offset="7146344">However, notwithstanding what he termed to be difficulties with it, notwithstanding some self confessed uncertainty as he explained quite expressedly in his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.087" offset="7186050">He found that the formulation had three specific virtues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.413" offset="7203395">He sought as accounting for the prior decisions of this Court that is prior to the term of the Eisen case or those as to where jurisdiction had been granted and those as to where it had not with one exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.752" offset="7244669">He sought as harmonizing the parallel relation of 1343 and 1331 during their long history stemming from the recodification in 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.998" offset="7289704">And finally, he felt convinced in the Eisen opinion that this rationale of Mr. Justice Stone preserved in 1343 the kind of case that was at the heart of the Civil Rights enactment, I believe we call them the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.642" offset="7344247">That is it preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.047" offset="7349890">Those causes of action based on discrimination, based on unequal treatment, based on denial of equal opportunity which could not be merged with money which not lend themselves to any kind of property analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.484" offset="7395656">And thus the Eisen decision in the Second Circuit effectively repeats the Stone analysis and gives rise to these -- the separation between 1343 and 1331 on the basis of whether or not the right alleges or assorted is or is not capable of monetary evaluation or whether it is one of those intangible rights of personal liberty which is not so capable and therefore for which no monetary requirement lies within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.182" offset="7498370">Now, it was the application of this analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.656" offset="7512267">That is of the Eisen rationale based on Mr. Justice Stone’s rationale that was at the heart of the lower court’s dismissal on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.066" offset="7553959">Now, the garnishment process in Connecticut -- and may I just explain that the garnishment process is a kind of attachment and Mr. Justice Stewart raised this question, I believe, the statute itself is entitled one of four in attachment, and garnishment is used not with respect to that statute but the understanding that is part of the overall attachment pattern in the State of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.941" offset="7641416">But --</text>

            <text syncTime="1900.617" offset="7676107">If we look at the attachment statutes as a whole there are several things which is a matter of fact are proscribed, all of them having kind of a common thread of interest which reflects a legislative concern in Connecticut for those kinds of property which come closes to enabling one to exist and enabling one to operate in a free society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.550" offset="7743921">You cannot attach or reach your garnish wages in advance with an action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.949" offset="8049449">The -- what I am trying to make though is that the process from the beginning, it is circumscribe, with respect to certain classes of assets and certain classes of suits and certain classes of plaintiffs for whom or as to whom the process is simply not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.906" offset="8113292">Now, these two plaintiffs in the basic cases below had money claims against the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.301" offset="8142863">One sued on a note the other provided a writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.843" offset="8153103">They were prohibited by Connecticut statute from attaching the kinds of asset or seeking to garnish the kinds of assets that I have described.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.692" offset="8184450">That is wages at the source, automobiles without a court order, necessarily household, personal effects or tools of one’s pre tree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.504" offset="8211722">They were permitted to garnish to reach the assets not in the hands of the debtor but in the hands of a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.954" offset="8241501">In this case there was one hand of savings account and the other hand a checking account, essentially a debt due which is the keyword in our garnishment statute from those banking institutions to the defendants in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.248" offset="8286641">Now the effect of doing so is to put a place, a conditional lien, on that asset during dependency of that lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.157" offset="8318301">Once that is done, that is once the garnishment process is effected there are provisions under the statute whereby the defendants can come in directly to the court for reduction, for a bill of particulars for verification of the claim, for a substitution of bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.774" offset="8376816">And that does not rely on the pendency of the suit; that can be done as soon as the garnishment process has been reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.181" offset="8398445">But it was under these circumstances, i.e., in looking at debt due to defendants from a third party that the court below attempted to analyze the nature of the interest involved and found it to be essentially a property interest, i.e., is one measurable by money since the accounts in question were fixed amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.671" offset="8480365">Being a property, interest it found it not to lie within the 1343 formulation under the Eisen and the Hague rationales and being merely a property interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.885" offset="8517250">The decision of the lower court based -- finding itself without jurisdiction was based on implicit assumption that would be subject to the 1331 jurisdictional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.348" offset="8563121">Now, there was no alternative holding in the court below and that was the one predicated on 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.520" offset="8595722">2283 being the anti-injunction statute which proscribes the application of injunction during the pendency of State Court proceeding, and this was relied upon by the lower court as an alternative holding having addressed itself to the jurisdictional issue first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.040" offset="8657893">Now, the purpose and the policy of 2283, I believe, are familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.008" offset="8685687">The statute dates from 1793 and it reflects the kind of sensitive concern for state proceedings that ought to be had by the Federal Judicial system once the state proceeding or once the State system has been set in motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.295" offset="8734902">It was a matter of first business for the Congress of United States to establish that relation between the two judicial processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.008" offset="8761756">Now the Connecticut garnishment statute or the attachment statute with which we are dealing with, dates of almost equal vintage as a matter of fact; it goes back to the beginning of the State of Connecticut and represents a scheme that has been in effect in the State of Connecticut during its judicial history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.321" offset="8819016">You must have this old state policy and a venerable federal policy now in focus within the confines of Section 2283, the anti-injunction statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.295" offset="8874919">Now, the question becomes whether for the purposes of Section 2283, the garnishment arrangement in Connecticut, the garnishment machinery, constitutes proceedings within the meaning of Section 2283 as to which the federal action should be staid during the pendency of the state case and the state proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2876.282" offset="11578801">But the point is that under Connecticut practice both the injunctive relief is available and that is within the jurisdiction of this precise court and the declaratory relief is also available, and I believe that the law of the State of Connecticut assures it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.405" offset="11627284">Reference has been made to Michael’s Jewelers against Handy which was a Sixth Circuit Court case of involving the same kinds of set of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.425" offset="11663438">That is the garnishment response by a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.723" offset="11672633">A motion for injunction was presented to the Court there and that Court addressed itself substantively to the constitutionality of the garnishment process in the light of SNAIDACH.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.412" offset="11711294">It held on the merits that it was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.928" offset="11721430">I supposed that settles for the time being the law of the Sixth Judicial Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.937" offset="11737416">But the point is, it indicates illustrators that cannot come up by motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.256" offset="11750687">A better way I submit would have been through if done so by counterclaim or by the declaratory judgment proceeding and even more effective device I also suggest come from 1983, the federal statute itself, which provides for a civil cause of action for damages in the event of deprivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.211" offset="11814530">That lies by way of counterclaim in the same Sixth Circuit Court which has the unique advantage of avoiding any mootness problem that we had in Toro, for instance you would call the companion Lynch here involve with situation, where the garnishment was in fact released as civil cause of action by way of counterclaim under 1983 for which the State Courts have concurrent jurisdiction to handle avoids very nicely the problem of mootness and combined with injunctive request and combine with declaratory judgment permits the raising in exactly the same court below, the Sixth Circuit Court in the Hague in Connecticut are precisely the issues that were sought to be presented to the Federal Court and the claims that have brought to the Three-Judge Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.543" offset="11971892">So I would say that that the availability of state remedies in the State Courts makes at all the law incumbent for under the 2283 fellow ups and to have consideration for the breadth of the proceedings which are then pending and to permit them to continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.812" offset="12028943">The constitutional issue has never been presented to the Connecticut Supreme Court throughout the long history of the garnishment process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.308" offset="12058932">The constitutional issue both as to the US Constitution and even under the State of Connecticut Constitutions which is a brand new constitutional since 1965, it adopted a new one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.208" offset="12102504">Those are open issues as far as the State is concerned and that State Supreme Court has never in light of SNAIDACH examined this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.706" offset="12132492">I believe all the more reason to construe the concepts of proceedings as it is construed in Hill against Martin forbear of the Federal intervention and permit the State Court process to continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.451" offset="12183483">The question of expressed exception to 2283 is discussed at length in our brief and all I would say in conclusion is that it is not just an exception it is an expressed exception which is required to 2283, at least some reference in the statute which takes cognizance of the problem of two pending actions going on simultaneously and tells one or the other to stay or to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.010" offset="12281704">There is no expressed reference in 1983 to that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.080" offset="12298004">There is no mention of the difficulty exposed by two pending actions and no requirement of one if the other go forward as is the case with virtually everyone of those expressed exceptions which have been historically noted to the 2283 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.851" offset="12373132">I have not had occasion to discuss further the request for declaratory relief which was embodied here or the denial of the injunctive remedy below, we believe it takes care of that request as well which was made our position on that as stated in the brief is that the request for declaratory judgment is essentially of the same effect as the request for declaratory -- for injunctive relief and we believe that the prior decision in cases so hold.</text>

            <text syncTime="3127.238" offset="12582634">Now, as to the Michael’s Jewelers case, there the Appellate Court, the Appellate Division of Circuit Court held that no appeal would lie from the refusal of the lower court to dissolve the garnishment on the ground that it is was levied without notice or hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.851" offset="12649090">The Appellate Court held that the three -- that the Circuit Court, the lower court, had no authority to entertain any relief and then it said, but at any rate Connecticut statutes providing for prejudgment garnishment of accounts is constitutional distinguishing SNIADACH.</text>

            <text syncTime="3184.249" offset="12810736">A counterclaim must be related to the matter in demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.108" offset="12822125">That is the way the practice book reads.</text>

            <text syncTime="3202.925" offset="12885341">The garnishment would be unrelated to the complaints that alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.128" offset="12902164">That is, the claim of Household Finance Corporation that money is doing owing from a note.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.169" offset="12926406">The only case I have been able to find is the case called the Bank against Riley (ph) reported in 12 Connecticut supplement in which it was held that a counterclaim in those circumstances would not lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.674" offset="12968411">Now -- but at any rate, it would seem that the issues in the Circuit Court have been settled by Michael’s Jewelers one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.558" offset="12999967">Either the Court cannot entertain the complaint, the motion to dissolve the garnishment or if it can -- if it can entertain it nevertheless, garnishment is still constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.107" offset="13046151">And let me simply refer the Court to our reply brief at Pages 23 and 24 in which we set out the substantial cause of litigating in the Connecticut Courts in order to bring a suit for declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.682" offset="13100381">For example, it is necessary as a jurisdictional requirement to notify all interested parties which carries a substantial cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.263" offset="13142700">Now, the Connecticut Supreme Court has, during all the years of this century, affirmed the constitutionality of summary prejudgment garnishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.283" offset="13178853">Not since SNIADACH; that is true, but in the Michael’s Jewelers case the Appellate Court opinion, the Appellate Court did not certify that a substantial question of law was involved thereby making an appeal to the Connecticut Supreme Court impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.831" offset="13241025">What occurred in that case was I suppose an equivalent of certiorari, the debtor filed a petition for certification to the Connecticut Supreme Court but that was never acted upon because then the creditor withdrew his underlying damage suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.780" offset="13308839">I would finally like to the state that a lawyer is not a ministerial officer of the Court and I would refer the -- and neither is a sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.066" offset="13345932">The sheriff is acting under the instructions of the lawyer who, under the decisions of the Connecticut Supreme Court, has full absolute discretion in levying a writ of garnishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.110" offset="13386161">I would refer the Court to the Sachs case again, Volume 92, Connecticut, Page 16 of our brief, in a case which is not in any of our briefs, Sharkovitz (ph) against Smith in Volume 143 of Connecticut reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.407" offset="13447287">We also state in our brief that even if the garnishment represents an abuse of process, the State Court is barred from releasing that garnishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.771" offset="13484799">Thus under Hill against Martin we would say that there is no action by the Court or any of its ministerial officers and therefore garnishment is not a proceeding in the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.416" offset="13519385">As to the remarks on jurisdiction, we will rest on our argument and our briefs unless there are further questions.</text>
