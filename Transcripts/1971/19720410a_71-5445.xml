            <text syncTime="89.106" offset="430151">This was commenced as an independent proceeding by way of common law certiorari in the Circuit Court of Hills Brooklyn County, which is a Court of journal jurisdiction to review the decision of the Municipal Court of Tampa refusing to quash the warrant in this case and it was -- the writ of certiorari was denied and that was affirmed by the District Court of Appeals and by the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.004" offset="521684">So that this common law certiorari proceeding which is an independent and separable proceeding under Florida law is at an end and I think that does make this final for this Court's purposes as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.315" offset="570898">In other words, it's not a part of the pending criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.783" offset="588766">I would in that connection, Your Honor, refer you to this Court's decision in Camara, the Municipal Court, the case involving administrative searches in this Court, which involved a writ of prohibition in advance of a trial for the violation of municipal ordinance and the case came all the way through this Court on the writ of prohibition without any factual record or without any trial of the issue and it was decided by this Court and thereby deemed final.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.785" offset="704854">So, that I do think that under the test that this Court has laid down, that you do have a final judgment under the judicial code.</text>

            <text syncTime="190.908" offset="837347">The appellant here was arrested in March, 1969 on a warrant which charged him with violation of a Tampa ordinance, careless driving of a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol or a drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.096" offset="898056">This warrant was applied for by a police officer of the City of Tampa and it was issued by a deputy clerk of the City of Tampa who had been designated as a clerk of the municipal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.936" offset="945390">The affidavit and the warrant appear at pages 6 and 7 of the joint appendix here.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.913" offset="977364">This offense is triable in the Tampa Municipal Court and it carries a penalty of not less than five days, no more than six months in jail or fine of not less than $250 or more than $500 or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.710" offset="1044551">As I indicated there was a motion to quash the arrest warrant in the Municipal Court which was denied and then the common-law certiorari proceeding was brought in the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.600" offset="1088123">It was denied there, affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals and by the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.300" offset="1110902">The Florida Supreme Court opinion is at pages 41 to 43 of the appendix and the Florida Supreme Court held that clerks and deputy clerks of the municipal court are authorized under Florida law to issue arrest warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.730" offset="1184567">And it further held that such clerks are neutral and detached magistrates under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, “by virtue of the Florida statues fixing their powers and duties to issue arrest warrants.”</text>

            <text syncTime="432.851" offset="1805132">He is actually a deputy city clerk and he is appointed by the city clerk who is administrative officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.100" offset="1830105">He has membership in the city civil service, and in that sense he really is an administrative or an executive officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.466" offset="1863542">He is designated by the city clerk to work in the municipal court, as a deputy municipal court clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.294" offset="1890814">In that sense, he is responsible or answerable, I suppose to the municipal court judges in his duties, but he also is responsible to the city clerk to whom he is a deputy.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.084" offset="1929997">So that you do not have it seems to me a clear chain of command here, such as you do in the US magistrate system and as you did under US commissioner system of responsibility by the officer solely to a judicial authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.313" offset="2102928">But what we are concerned about with, I think are his status and his independence in exercising the judgment to issue the warrant in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.530" offset="2139813">In other words, I don't think it’s sufficient that his decisions can be reviewed later on by the way of quashing the warrant before a municipal court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.745" offset="2168652">I don't think that, that's what this Court contemplated when it spoke of an independent judicial officer or a neutral and detached magistrate issuing the warrant in the first instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1494.484" offset="6051597">It does not result in the defendant being bodily taken into court, and of course he has got the right to come in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.885" offset="6089214">In other words, if what you had here was utilized simply a summons or subpoena procedure issue by the clerk, I think you would have an entirely different case because then you would not have an arrest of the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.096" offset="6138115">It's the fact that this is an arrest warrant which authorized the police officer to take the defendant immediately in the custody and with all that, that implies in terms of loss of liberty, having the post-bail, possible embarrassment and humiliation in terms of employment and with family and of course an arrest record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.172" offset="6206347">All those consequences flow for what happened here, because it was an arrest warrant rather than a summons or a subpoena procedure, So that I think that the subpoena or summons procedure is particularly where you’re dealing with the municipal ordinances, although these are not emergency situations, these are not serious crimes in the sense of felonies where you can dispense with warrant altogether, I think that's really the proper way to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.575" offset="6299969">In that connection, I would like to direct Your Honor’s attention to the decision of the Supreme Court of Minnesota, in the Paulick case which we have sited both in our brief and then in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.939" offset="6341452">The court there took precisely that position, that the proper way to proceed in these cases was through a summons procedure, if it was too burdensome on the judges to issue arrest warrants, but that it would not be constitutional under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments for deputy clerk in Minnesota.</text>

            <text syncTime="3536.313" offset="14218938">Now as to the neutral and detached magistrate, the clerk of that municipal court is appointed by the city clerk.</text>

            <text syncTime="3821.387" offset="15359235">It's a District Court of Appeals decision not a Supreme Court decision in Florida, but it does deal with the question of challenging the validity of an arrest at the trial itself and I think that in view of that decision that appellant here was really quite justified and perhaps required under Florida Law to resort to this independent proceeding and it is an independent proceeding under state law and I do think that you have a appellate jurisdiction, Your Honor.</text>
