            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="41.040" offset="237875">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.902" offset="249265">Now this is a direct appeal from a judgment of a three-judge District Court in the Eastern district of New York, holding unconstitutional a provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.174" offset="306316">It excludes from the United States aliens who advocate, or whose writings advocate, or teach the doctrines of world communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.509" offset="343724">The statute involved is set forth at pages 3 and 4 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.619" offset="368174">And it is composed as far as this litigation is concerned of two sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.337" offset="386982">The first is Section 212 (a), which says except as otherwise provided the following classes of aliens shall be ineligible to receive visas and shall be excluded from admission into the Untied States.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.920" offset="445392">Then subdivision 28 says aliens would any time have been members of the following classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.402" offset="471306">I will now just combine for simplicity sub-paragraphs V and G of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.576" offset="491995">What it says is that aliens who advocate, or whose writings advocate or teach the economic, international and governmental doctrines of world communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.763" offset="536716">Now at the top of the page 4, is another provision which is referred to as the waiver provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.623" offset="564197">And what it says is that in the event of an alien who is otherwise ineligible for admission under the prior sections of which 28 is one, that alien maybe temporarily admitted to the United Sates after approval by the Attorney General of a recommendation either by the Secretary of State, or of the counselor office involved that the alien be temporarily admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General, so that for this provision to be operative, we need two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.380" offset="703169">First, there has to be a recommendation for a way but by either the counselor official involved or the secretary of state, and secondly, the Attorney General must grant the waiver in his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.777" offset="752801">The appellee, Dr. Mandel is a Belgian citizen, a resident of Brussels who is a prominent Marxist economist.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.094" offset="790000">He is not a member of the Communist Party, but he describes himself as a revolutionary Marxist.</text>

            <text syncTime="196.178" offset="858336">The District Court described him as an orthodox Marxist of the Trotskyist school.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.721" offset="876517">Apparently he does not agree with some of the views of Russian communism, but he is saying and his writings indicate he is urging and seeking to develop a revolution under which the workers will take over control.</text>

          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="216.243" stopTime="374.461">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="216.243" offset="938689">Academic life primarily, and he has written a book called, Marxist Economic, that is considered a well-known work and indeed his works are sometimes studied in college.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.977" offset="989575">And we think that under the statute there is no question that he comes within the definition of someone who advocates the doctrines of world communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.041" offset="1021862">Now in 1962 and 1968, Dr. Mandel came to this country pursuant to waivers it had been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.234" offset="1062613">In the first case in 1962 he came here as a journalist and in the second year he came here to give a series of lectures.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.697" offset="1092498">In the fall of 1969, he again sought a visa in Brussels for the purpose of giving lectures here and attending various meetings in the academic community.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.838" offset="1137010">The first application which he filed, he filed two of them in 1969, the application in that case to request for a waiver, -- the question of a waiver was denied by the State Department in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.588" offset="1196047">Then later on in November of 1969, the counsel and the State Department recommended to the Attorney General that a waiver be granted to Dr. Mandel.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.759" offset="1252680">They explained that on the earlier occasion in 1969, they had declined to recommend a waiver because they said that he engaged in activities beyond the stated purpose of his trip when he came to this country in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.035" offset="1317778">However, the State Department said they subsequently learned, that when he made his previous trip to the United States, Dr. Mandel may not have been aware of the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.849" offset="1357066">That he came here pursuant to a waiver of the ineligibility requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.460" offset="1379531">And therefore may not have been aware of the limitations imposed upon his trip to this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.054" offset="1405862">And they also pointed out, that Dr. Mandel had given assurances that on this time he will conform to his stated itinerary and purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.492" offset="1443688">The Attorney General acting through the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to whom he has delegated his authority under this statute denied the waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.665" offset="1484334">And the reason is most clearly set forth, I think in the paragraph of the bottom of 68 in the left, which is the record, which is a letter from the associate commission of operations of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to Mr. Boudin, Dr. Mandel's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.942" offset="1557477">And what this letter says is on his last visit in 1968 --.</text>

            <text syncTime="374.461" offset="1571479">Excuse me, Mr. Friedman, on the 58 of the Appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="377.264" offset="1582764">68, I am sorry, 68 of the Appendix, Mr. Chief Justice, at the bottom of that page and last paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.442" offset="1615469">On his last visit in 1968, Mr. Mandel's entry was authorized for a series of academic engagements in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.585" offset="1647965">His activities while here were much reported to the press and went far beyond the stated purposes of his trip, on the basis of which his admission had been authorized and represented a flagrant abuse of the opportunities afforded him to express his views in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.469" offset="1719541">Now in March of 1970, the complaint in this case was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.643" offset="1744200">The plaintiffs Dr. Mandel and sixth American University professors.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.870" offset="1769173">The general allegation of the complaint was that the statutory provision directing the exclusion of the aliens who advocated the doctrine of world communism, was unconstitutional and violation of the First and Fifth Amendments and that the waiver provision was similarly unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.169" offset="1846391">And the theory however is rather interesting because there is no claim in this case that the plaintiffs are asserting any rights on behalf of Dr. Mandel.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.338" offset="1891009">They claim their asserting their First Amendment rights to hear to Mandel and to discuss it.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.775" offset="1916818">As they put it in their complaint that Dr. Mandel's exclusion denied then, the American Professors, the right to hear Mandel in University and other public forums in this country, and to exercise their freedom of academic inquiry by engaging Mandel in an open and face to face exchange of information and opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.265" offset="2002708">And they now state in their brief at page 14, they are suing only to enforce their rights and assert none on the part of the invited alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.338" offset="2043041">A divided three-judge court held the statute unconstitutional both on its face and as applied, ended a declaratory judgment to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.581" offset="2080031">And also a preliminary injunction enjoining the Attorney General from refusing to admit Dr. Mandel on a temporarily on a visa.</text>

            <text syncTime="529.146" offset="2190267">The question is whether I read the judgment of the District Court as turning solely on constitutional grounds and my answer is I do.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.726" offset="2216599">I think the opinion makes it quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.468" offset="2227570">The Court recognized that although Dr. Mandel himself had no right to enter this country, it concluded that American citizens here have a First Amendment right to hear him and to exchange views with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.424" offset="2291413">And they said this First Amendment right and the plaintiffs must prevail over the Government's right to exclude him because, the government was excluding him not because he was actually engaging in a dangerous activity, but merely because of the views that he advocated.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.183" offset="2358391">They then went on to say that as far as the wavier was concerned that where the exclusion of the alien impinges on rights protected by the First Amendment, you can't let that as admission turned on the discretionary action of the Attorney General and then seemingly a little inconsistent with that went on and said, but in any event since we hold that the government has no right to exclude him at all, it's irrelevant whether or not, the discretion was properly exercised.</text>

            <text syncTime="698.004" offset="2865689">The only question in this case is whether they have a constitutional right to enforce, to force the government to admit Dr. Mandel, so they can talk to him face to face, so that they can discuss things with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.992" offset="2925666">The record shows in this case that on one occasion after he was denied admission on audience of 1200 people in Town Hall in New York City heard by a tape recording, the text of the speech he would have been planning to give there.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.791" offset="2976866">So his views are freely available to everyone in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.656" offset="2996302">The only question is whether or not the teachers have a right to have face to face confrontations with a man, that Congress is said is ineligible for admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.038" offset="3041859">Now as the case was presented to the District Court, the major challenge to this statute was to the constitutionality of the exclusion of this class of alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.185" offset="3094418">But when the case comes to this court the appellees have rather dramatically shifted their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.827" offset="3116987">As I read their brief they no longer are attempting to defend the decision of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.428" offset="3143423">They now argue not that the statute is constitutional but that the refusal of the Attorney General to grant a waiver was in progress.</text>

            <text syncTime="815.465" offset="3335580">The argument that has been abandoned is that the statutes on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.466" offset="3351567">The ban on the admission of aliens who advocate the doctrines of world communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.139" offset="3378212">But that is on its face invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.262" offset="3386675">That argument as I understand has been abandoned in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.018" offset="3397751">I think they do challenge, they do challenge the contention, the effectiveness of the wavier but even there as I understand it, it's not so much because it vests un-reviewable discretion on the Attorney General as rather that the Attorney General improperly exercises discretion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.400" offset="3479253">Mr. Boudin will explain little further but that's as I read his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.408" offset="3495345">And this narrower argument is one that was not made in the District Court, one that we think the District Court has very clearly not decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.337" offset="3527005">And one which we think under the circumstances is not appropriately open to me made in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.091" offset="3549993">If in fact this is a consideration it's one we think that should be made on the District Court if the case goes back on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.515" offset="3579773">Now the congressional exclusion of varies categories of aliens has a long history.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.057" offset="3601924">It goes back almost a 100 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.607" offset="3612060">That began in 1875 with the exclusion of two categories, convicts and prostitutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.297" offset="3638809">In 1903, the categories of excludable aliens were expanded to include among other anarchists and people who believe in or advocate the overthrow of the government by force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.897" offset="3693249">Progressively, the categories of excludable aliens were expanded and in 1950, in the Internal Security Act of that year, was a provision, comparable to the provision in the present act providing for the exclusion of aliens who advocated the doctrines of world communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.055" offset="3769840">This expansion was based on congressional findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.754" offset="3784677">In the 1950 Act as to the menace of world communism, as to the dangers, that members of the communist movement would come into this country and surreptitiously subvert our institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.564" offset="3839952">Now, for almost as long as Congress has excluded categories of aliens of various types.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.346" offset="3871090">This Court has recognized the broad power of Congress to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.561" offset="3891884">Since the Chinese Exclusion Case, in 1889, this Court has repeatedly recognized and stressed the broad authority of Congress to exclude aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.758" offset="3948726">In 1904 almost 70 years ago in the case called Turner, that the Court upheld that how to exclude an anarchist under the statute as it was then written, even though it was willing to assume for purposes of decision that the anarchist basic attitude was primarily philosophical rather than actually planning to destroy the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.138" offset="4046215">As the justice Frankfurter stated for the Court in his opinion in Galvan against Press some years ago, when we are dealing with the power to exclude aliens we had not merely a page of history put a whole volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.991" offset="4097624">Now the right to exclude aliens is inherent, in the sovereignty of any nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.980" offset="4117582">It's necessary both to protect the domestic security of the nation and also to aided in the conduct of foreign relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.651" offset="4152272">So the contention comes down to is this basically in this case and I might add in passing that appellees themselves in this court and the District Court recognized that Mandel as such has no right to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.570" offset="4203995">So the contention basically comes down to is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.590" offset="4216011">Even though Dr. Mandel himself had no right to enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.002" offset="4229699">The fact that the appellees want to hear him and want to meet with him, gives them a right to compel his admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.038" offset="4253836">Though, as they have greater rights to compel his admission to this country, than he has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.468" offset="4279541">We know of no case that has held or even suggested that this kind of a claim, the right of people, the claim that the people want to hear someone talk, overwrites the power, plenary power of congress to exclude aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.764" offset="4340772">Now the people in this country admittedly have a First Amendment right to listen to speaking that is going on, they do normally think have a right to overrule the settled power of the Congress and force the admission of an alien who belongs to a category that Congress has said is not be admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.136" offset="4422169">The reason we think this statute does not impinge any First Amendment rights of the appellees, is basically it relates not to speech but to action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.518" offset="4463756">It doesn't bar an alien from speaking, it bars the alien from coming in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.483" offset="4479639">Now of course, obviously if he can't come in, he can't speak here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1145.114" offset="4654137">We don't think that turns this statute into a law of Congress abridging the freedom of speech, within the meaning of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.835" offset="4689036">This Court had very similar argument presented to what in the case of Zemel against Rusk which upheld the authority of the Secretary of State to denied passports to Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.206" offset="4734489">In that case, Mr. Zemel said that he wanted to satisfy his curiosity about the State of Affairs in Cuba and that his visit would make him a better informed citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.579" offset="4775972">Now this court said that the denial of a passport to Mr. Zemel to visit Cuba invaded no First Amendment rights of Mr. Zemel, and the reason we think applies equally to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.023" offset="4829784">This is what the Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.634" offset="4836158">To the extent that the secretary's refusal to validate passports for Cuba act as an inhibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.451" offset="4863430">That is an inhibition on obtaining information about Cuba and would be unrealistic to assume that it does not, it is an inhibition of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.746" offset="4896658">There are few restrictions on action which could not be closed by ingenious argument in regard of decreased data flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.913" offset="4929363">The right to speak and publish does not carry whether the unrestrained right to gather information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.386" offset="4959247">And we think the same principle applies in this case, the right to speak freely between themselves, the right perhaps to engage in face to face dialog with speakers in this country does not give them the right to insist that anyone they want to hear can be brought into this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.234" offset="5026643">So as far as the holding of the District Court that the statute is unconstitutional to ban, we think the basic error of the District Court as I think is demonstrated in the dissenting opinion was its failure to recognize the broad authority of Congress in this country to exclude aliens of any class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.115" offset="5110130">Now let me come to the other aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.086" offset="5122042">The refusal of the Attorney General to waive Dr. Mandel's ineligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.643" offset="5144194">Now of course, most of the arguments that I have made previously apply in this situation too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.203" offset="5170525">It seems to us, if the appellees have no First Amendment right to bring them into here and it seems to me equally they have no First Amendment right to complain that the Attorney General declined to waive his ineligibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="1424.065" offset="5769879">That was a statute very close to this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.741" offset="5780641">It provided that the “The Attorney General may, in his discretion, virtually the same language that we have here suspend deportation of an alien who would otherwise be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.110" offset="5842081">The statute setup various such conditions which had to be met before an alien was eligible for deportation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.727" offset="5884609">The question in the case was whether an alien who met those statutory standards could nevertheless be denied suspension of deportation by the Attorney General without a hearing and on the basis of confidential information known only to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.681" offset="5964439">Now this Court held that the Attorney General could do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.190" offset="5986382">And the reason the Court gave was that Congress in the statute have left it to the unfettered discretion as it described it of the Attorney General to decide a particular case, whether or not to suspend deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.080" offset="6050016">It pointed out that the Congress in its statute did not provide standards for determining who among qualified applicants for admission should receive the ultimate relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.923" offset="6089409">That determination is left to the sound discretion of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.146" offset="6106231">The statute says that as to qualified deportable aliens, the Attorney General may in his discretion suspend deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.541" offset="6139877">It does not restrict the considerations which maybe relied upon or the procedure by which the discretion should be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.339" offset="6171015">Grant thereof is manifestly, not a matter of right under any circumstances, but rather in all cases a matter of grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.546" offset="6199854">And we think that the language applies, principally applies equally to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.881" offset="6217200">Congress has not specified any standards by which the Attorney General is to decide in his discretion whether or not to grant away for ineligibility.</text>

            <text syncTime="1639.885" offset="6633173">We will begin with two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.511" offset="6647698">One suggested out of questioning of Mr. Justice Marshall and the other the result of the reference Jay against Boyd and to unfettered discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.795" offset="6684896">First, this is of course, a case, a suit by American citizens, American university professors and “Dr. Mandel was in a sense made a plaintiff because he is symbolic of a problem.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.277" offset="6730767">The real parties of interest we've conceded from the beginning are only the American university professors and the institutions which they represent.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1671.828" offset="6760964">Well, are they asserting his rights?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leonard_b_boudin" startTime="1673.909" stopTime="1842.715">
            <label>Mr. Leonard B. Boudin</label>
            <text syncTime="1673.909" offset="6769324">They are asserting their rights Your Honor and not his.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.389" offset="6783221">Now the second aspect is the reference to Jay against Boyd and to unfettered discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.820" offset="6804955">I know of no case whether it deals with aliens or whether it deals with any other aspect of American law where unfettered discretion has been upheld by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.526" offset="6863782">In Jay against Boyd the problem that was posed there was whether or not when the Attorney General states that considerations of national security forbid him to state the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.796" offset="6916863">The court will accept the good faith statement of the Attorney General and we would too, if we didn't have a reason stated here that we could challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.670" offset="6948315">And in Hintopoulos where Mr. Justice Harlan did recognize that the suspension of deportation was a matter of race, he added in the concluding paragraph that the facts in that case show that Attorney General had not acted capriciously or arbitrarily and we don't think that in any case, and particularly one involving the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.080" offset="7065970">This court would stand for the proposition that if we had a fact situation which we think we can establish here, where there is arbitrary and capricious denial of First Amendment rights, then such action by the Government would be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.399" offset="7131276">Now, the Government has pointed out that there seems to a shift of position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.862" offset="7149144">I may say there maybe a shift of emphasis, but our position has been consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.502" offset="7171714">In the court below on behalf of the America plaintiffs, as I say saving their First Amendment right, we took the position very much similar to the one which I happen to have taken in Kent against Dulles, many years before, arguing that the statutes on their face as applied were unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.507" offset="7259694">Court will recall that it took a more limited view when the case finally came up and said that the statute was not intended to apply, because of the First Amendment rights that were involved to the situation there namely the denial of passports for political reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.180" offset="7322388">But we also took in this case as Your Honors will see from our complaint, a direct attack upon the Attorney General's action as capricious and as without any foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.260" offset="7370662">We did not give up either point when we opposed the appeal here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.981" offset="7393546">What we did was attempt to support the decision on a narrower ground following the standard practice in this court or seeking a narrow ground if it could be done in declaring a statute unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1852.365" offset="7483093">It wasn't our fault, it was the Government that said through an affidavit filed by Assistant US Attorney Baker, this matter is un-revealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.214" offset="7518515">We decline to give any reason to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.438" offset="7531472">Had the Government given a reason to the District Court, as it now it does here, I think the District Court would have then said the action taken was un-revealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.182" offset="7566372">But our rights should not be fought for two years later after the litigation began, because they decided to stand on a fundamental principle and not offer any reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.018" offset="7605764">Now, let me point out the shift of positions taken by the Government, not because they are inconsistent, but because as we have done in changes of emphasis, the Government has had a perfect right to do it, but they do bear a relationship, because on each one they pose a proposition upon which we take issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.166" offset="7694372">In the District Court as I indicated before the Government said it had a absolute -- The Attorney General had an absolute, an un-revealable exercise of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.076" offset="7737944">I will address myself to that shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.730" offset="7748602">In the main brief here, bearing in mind what the District Court had done in holding the statute not on its face, but as applied to this particular academic situation invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.527" offset="7803773">As applied here, the Government took the basic position that the exclusion and deportation cases were exercised of the sovereign power of the Federal Government, the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.215" offset="7854555">Now, if we had that statute before, and if we were not able to give as we think we now have been able to give an alternative constitutional interpretation to the statute and shift the emphasis to the Attorney General's violations of the congressional intent, which I should try to establish and shift the statute to a position which the Attorney General has acted arbitrarily regardless of statutory intent in denying the American citizens access to Dr. Mandel here for these academic discussions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.926" offset="7981405">Now let's say that even a statute of this kind for the reasons indicated by the court below and in the O'Brian case would be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.939" offset="8013379">I would then argue that there is no substantial legitimate governmental interest in excluding a person of Dr. Mandel's economic and philosophical views.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.722" offset="8052563">We are not dealing here remember with (a)27 category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.938" offset="8069386">We are not dealing which are the people who are absolutely forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.639" offset="8084223">We are not dealing with the (a)29 category which deals with people who violate laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.422" offset="8107315">We are dealing with (a)27 D and G.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.449" offset="8119436">We aren't dealing with the other (a)27 categories of those people whom congress considered more activist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.570" offset="8143991">Then we present the former member of Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.402" offset="8155276">I would then argue that this category of persons should not be prevented from meeting with American academicians, universities where no substantial interest of the Government is shown and under the O'Brien case involving the destruction of draft card as the Court remember.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.800" offset="8232912">The court did set forth certain tests, and one of them was that there must be a predominating government interest, the otherwise the effect -- the court raised the question of whether the effect was direct or incidental to First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.155" offset="8290277">Then came the question of the least restricted means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.106" offset="8306055">The test referred to in Shelton, but used in other words namely, whether it's essential to a governmental interest in O'Brien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.621" offset="8340119">Now, when the Government filed its brief, its reply brief here which I recited and probably some members of the court had not yet received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.426" offset="8375332">The Government then went back, not possibly as a result of our briefs, and I am not complaining, went back to the original assertion which it had made in the District Court of an unlimited and un-reviewable exercise of executive discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.465" offset="8443564">Except it did one more thing as a matter of precaution which it didn't do in the District Court, it gave a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.503" offset="8471671">The reason they flagrant abuse of Dr. Mandel's 1968 trip which I think the court will realize is superficial and not agreed to by the State Department and persisted in by the government is really all I have to do is say it's a case of bureaucratic, lower bureaucratic stubbornness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.032" offset="8557771">And, as I say bureaucratic stubbornness, because there is no foundation for the action, for the argument now made by the Attorney General that would happen in 1968, namely the fact that at a cocktail party that Dr. Mandel attended in which an event occurred at the end in which he had nothing to do namely the selling the postage for French students.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.045" offset="8649826">This is basically the flagrant abuse that is relied on by the Attorney General in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2185.611" offset="8816070">That's one of the reasons why we began in this case by conceding that the alien's rights are not involved, they don't have the First Amendment rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2209.166" offset="8910320">In other words, the reasons it gave for withholding information were considered sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.663" offset="8928292">And there is always in a whole line of cases beginning with Chinese Exclusion all the way down to Harisiades and so forth, a statement of the very broad powers of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.095" offset="8970088">The question however is, whether there is in any area an unlimited executive power, something we address ourselves to in our brief, or even an unlimited congressional power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.819" offset="9024945">I would wonder for example, although I had intended to turn to this determining in analyzing the executive's action; whether a congressional statute which said that a person who was not in an activist class, but is a celebrated economic, the economist in lots of school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.937" offset="9101431">If Congress had passed a statute saying that the entry into the United States for a brief visit of such a person for the purpose of attending an academic meeting with Professor Richard Falk of Princeton would be forbidden, because Professor Falk has written as one of the editors of American Journal of International Law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2296.481" offset="9259629">That is the statute itself and is it acceptable of constitutional construction which would not give the vast powers to the Attorney General suggested and which in fact challenges those vast powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2363.945" offset="9529422">The first is the recognition in Shelton against Tucker and Mr. Justice Frankfurter's concurring opinion and Mr. Justice Harlan in Sweezy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.637" offset="9568187">The special role of the University.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.159" offset="9578323">I am warned against being a leadist (ph) here by my colleagues, but the fact is that the University is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.885" offset="9605177">I include schools as well, in terms of our democratic system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.422" offset="9623358">The second principle, I rely upon is a line of decisions which range -- I can't go back much further for the moment in De Jonge against Oregon in going up to New York Times against Sullivan and of course the Red Lion case on which I rely specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.272" offset="9686783">And that line relates to what maybe a cliché, but if so it's a fundamental one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.301" offset="9710920">Namely, the relationship of the First Amendment to the sovereignty of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.777" offset="9728788">As opposed to the governmental sovereignty, sovereign rights which he here claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.007" offset="9749686">And the third line suggested, I think a few minutes ago, is a line of the right to know which began at least within my memory in Martin against Struthers and moved into the Lamont case which again involved I thought a very great powerful power of the government to refuse the entry of communist material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.545" offset="9835890">But which the court held referred specifically to Mr. Justice Brennan's concurring opinion I believe there, that we were dealing again, not with the rights of the communist who were sending literature, but we were dealing with the rights of the receiver and I distinguish this case from the cases which involved foreign monies coming here or monies going to abroad or Schilling against Rogers the Trading with the Enemy Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.227" offset="9934529">I am dealing exclusively with the question of the First Amendment rights of Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.798" offset="9952814">Now, what the Government says in response is that it has a right to be arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.831" offset="9972981">The executive says, because it says Congress has given it this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.078" offset="9993983">Before I turn again to the congressional power, let me say that I think another principle, the court has laid down in Stovall and in (Inaudible) and in Red Lion is that the government cannot be arbitrary and I don't have before me, the precise quotation where Mr. Justice White made some reference to the limitations upon the bureaucratic irresponsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.845" offset="10089069">It's a very rough paraphrase to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.234" offset="10102653">The question however is that Congress intends to give this power to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.417" offset="10131387">Now, the Government has said that the statute is read in the way indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.416" offset="10155315">Let me add to the construction of the statue that there are two kinds of persons involved in ineligibility, a political ineligibility primarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.501" offset="10203694">The first is a category on which Congress has passed the complete ban; that's the (a)28 it's (a)27, the (a)28 and the Section F where the President has the power to declare people inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.240" offset="10258656">The second this is (a)27 category that we are dealing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.681" offset="10272344">And particularly, the (a)27 D and G.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.719" offset="10288540">Now, the question is did Congress intend to give unlimited power to the Attorney General or is there some standard particularly in the light of the First Amendment situation to which we are directing ourselves here, namely the American academic situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.639" offset="10344233">Are there any limitations at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.209" offset="10354473">Well, they can be found not in the statutory language, but they can be found in two or three reports of Congress cited by us and by the Government in our briefs which Your Honors will see.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.867" offset="10405151">In which the public interest, admittedly a difficult concept, but I am sure applied very often, if the field is not relating to the First Amendment, in which Congress stated that it was in the public interest that the Attorney General exercised his discretionary power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.189" offset="10466382">The alternative was also humanity which I am not suggesting to involve here in main reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.399" offset="10495221">Now in addition to that the statistics which I think Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out are really significant, because in 1969, for example, the critical year here, at least for the purpose of this case about 5,000 recommendations were made by American Council abroad for the most part to the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.404" offset="10579335">And that very important administrative practice showed that only nine applications were denied by the Attorney General and our guess, no basis and the Government doesn't have the facts that those nine were probably not cases; probably not cases in which the Secretary of State himself or the persons important to the bureau security council affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.332" offset="10670973">So it was important that Dr. Mandel come here and probably cases where only council is involved and probably cases where you had political activist school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.942" offset="10713395">Now I have jumped to the legal analysis here and to the administrative implementation urging again that the court take a narrow view of the powers given here in order to avoid constitutional problem, but I don't want to miss the critical facts, which as usual one misses when he meets the Government's argument on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.519" offset="10795733">The critical facts are that the start here is not from Mandel who wanted to come here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.383" offset="10819244">He celebrated and love to live in Europe and to receive the respect of other universities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.394" offset="10839201">Dr. Mandel who came here in 1968 and delivered lectures before 30 American Universities including Princeton, was invited in 1969 to debate Professor Galbraith of Harvard at Stanford University with the administration's approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.539" offset="10903776">And then followed six other invitations -- and many other invitations of which he accepted six, and where the Americans wanted him, not he who wanted come here particularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.387" offset="10947244">Now, the applications were denied and it turns out if I could short-circuit it, the applications were denied because of this assumption that somehow rather he had technically violated the conditions of his coming in earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.665" offset="11000324">But the American Council and the State Department recognized that this was an error on their part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.744" offset="11020595">They had not told him when they gave him the visas that he was politically ineligible and therefore conditions with entry of acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.417" offset="11047345">He had assumed that he was eligible as he had the American academicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.686" offset="11064377">And it was only because he came in not as an eligible, but one whose eligibility was weighed that these conditions which are really very technical and hardly an important state interest were suggested by the American Council for the first time, as a reason for excluding Dr. Mandel and not making a recommendations after his stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.392" offset="11143266">I was then communicated with, not by Dr. Mandel, I am not a Marxist, we are obviously friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.213" offset="11170538">I was communicated by the American academic community which said we want this man here and we want to debate with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2782.328" offset="11202930">We want to engage --</text>

            <text syncTime="2814.997" offset="11333647">I remember Your Honor -- Mr. Chief Justice, I warned myself about leaders and I am not sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.755" offset="11356739">I do think however that the importance of education, whether at schools or universities as such that the court will treat that aspect very often, how you should make the inception, will treat that aspect differently than it we will treat for example Dr. Mandel's desire to deliver a talk to an unlimited American audience who had not invited him to come here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.886" offset="11453183">And in that sense, I think there are gradations, as we saw in the last several case there, gradations of rights of access to buildings for the labor reasons and gradations of First Amendment rights, at least each case must be considered on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.037" offset="11509817">Now, the Attorney General here in his action we think therefore in the light of what I have said is a very sparse congressional history but a very satisfactory administrative practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.435" offset="11575436">We think is acted arbitrarily and in violation of the First Amendment as well as in violation of a public interest concept and is because Your Honors will recall reading the brief, what I have not said that the Department of State in Washington; when I approached them said representing the academicians, I want a meeting between the University professors and you, writing to Mr. Elliot Richardson then on the Secretary of State, I had known of his interest, the freedom of speech from his articles in the Harvard Law Review many years ago on the Dennis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.803" offset="11708870">I thought he was a right man to write to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.049" offset="11717856">And the response was that we do recognize that this may have been an error, a misunderstanding between Dr. Mandel and ourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.175" offset="11754323">We do recognize the importance of the academic community and its interest in the thing, and finally came the recommendation of the secretary of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.991" offset="11785670">Yes, in the interest of freedom of speech and freedom of opinion Dr. Mandel should be admitted and the answer of the Attorney General was, no, and as Your Honor has seen me tracing it, no for no reason; now no for a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.179" offset="11854424">Now all of these cases with respect to reviewability that is suggested by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.413" offset="11887338">On that cases in which the Court has denied justiciability, that cases in which the Court has weighed the factors, war power O'Brien and (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.216" offset="11930493">One for the individual, the other against the individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="2970.743" offset="11956615">I argued Zemel; I radically lost, but I argued Zemel here and I urged the First Amendment rights on the part of Zemel being, even though the matter was phrased in terms of its individual curiosity to see what would happen in Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.860" offset="12009069">But they were very strong foreign policy reasons urged by the Government before this court, evaluated by this court and upheld by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.476" offset="12055567">Is this tactical violation to being at a cocktail party be equivalent of our relations with Cuba and (Inaudible) in Cuba.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.347" offset="12083048">In the field of National security again Harisiades and all of these cases received very careful analysis in the court and the court that divided of course in many of those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.759" offset="12136755">Even in the field of immigration as I indicated before, the Government is quite right in citing this Mr. Justice Powell's one line statement of that fact that it's a matter of race, but quite I will call delinquent in error in failing to give his concluding line that they did not regard the considerations involved there as being arbitrary and unreasonable and capricious and so we now come down to the conclusion of our problem here; a) no reason given in the court below, b) no foundation in fact suggested and the use of the word 'flagrant abuse' is really a hyperbole which I regret to say that Government adopted from their earlier letter sent by one of the immigration officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.586" offset="12339988">We have here a situation where the opinion of the Secretary of State which certainly indicates that foreign relations are not affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.580" offset="12371962">Because if Dr. Mandel for example had been, let us say at the moment, a Soviet Marxist, and Soviets were not allowing our economist to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.047" offset="12413862">Or even if we had a position of opposition to the Soviet Government which we wanted to demonstrate, then this court would have to weigh the question, whether the First Amendment rights of the academicians in the universities overbalance this or it doesn't, the state department's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.917" offset="12477288">And I suspect it would come out against the universities in such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.274" offset="12490767">But we have here a statement that on the history I have given you, in other words attacking the statute and not just as written, but as applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="3259.160" offset="13110287">I think the Attorney General in each one of these cases does exercise discretion, I would assume that so in good faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.274" offset="13202760">That means that every exercise of discretion by an Attorney General under the statute is subject to judicial review?</text>

            <text syncTime="3288.537" offset="13227838">No, I would not say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.086" offset="13234003">Well, the question of what is subject judicial review and when the courts will overrule the Attorney General is another problem almost everything is subject to judicial review in this country, but tremendous deference is obviously paid to the views of Congress and even to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.601" offset="13296070">I would say that given a situation where the Attorney General is given a reason, and sometimes giving a reason could be worse than not giving a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.195" offset="13330447">And given a reason which this court can say, is absolutely absurd, it's frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.573" offset="13355942">And if the Attorney General for example had given a reason that I had suggest, there another one, that Professor (Inaudible) would recall him is a rather conservative at least by Dr. Mandel's standards, professor of economics had written books criticizing our American Economic Policy, and he wanted Dr. Mandel in his university in the New School of Social Research.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.358" offset="13443087">He wanted Dr. Mandel to come here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.742" offset="13452595">It would be frivolous and it would be unreasonable, it would be in violation of the First Amendment rights to deny his right to access to Dr. Mandel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.099" offset="13490107">I don't think we have to take a lot of whole statute, and particularly we will need to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.898" offset="13505258">I urged in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.731" offset="13512573">I don't think we have to do so, if we can say a; either that the Attorney General's position is arbitrary and unreasonable one, and that this court have never upheld a decision which it said was unreasonable and arbitrary by the executive branch, or , we say Congress intended there be some standards here, and that one of the things Congress did not intend is that, because of what I call simply bureaucratic stubbornness, the rights of the American academic community should be rejected.</text>

            <text syncTime="3402.779" offset="13684772">I think Your Honor is correct, that the Court has never excluded aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.411" offset="13703266">But I will say that in no case, in the history of this Court including the Turner case, the famous amicus case argued by Clarence Darrow and Edgar Lee Masters in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.071" offset="13746003">In no case has it been the First Amendment rights of the American citizens that was alleged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.795" offset="13768886">They were never the plaintiffs, poor Mr. Turner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.301" offset="13778917">I guess it was Turner, they confuse with that Turner too.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.238" offset="13794591">Poor Mr. Turner was a man who was asserting as an alien his First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.325" offset="13823012">Well, it's a long time, it's pretty late.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.834" offset="13833043">I would like to re-argue Turner against Williams, but it's too late, and if Clarence Darrow failed, I would certainly fail.</text>
