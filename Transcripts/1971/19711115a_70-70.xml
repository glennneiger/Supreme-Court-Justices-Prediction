            <label>Mr. Richard W. Mclaren</label>
            <text syncTime="19.582" offset="151994">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.056" offset="165891">This matter is before the Court on writ of certiorari for the Fifth Circuit which overturned the Federal Trade Commission decision that respondent Sperry and Hutchinson, frequently referred to as S&amp;H, has engaged in certain unfair activities in its Green Stamp business in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.655" offset="272262">The complaint in this case was in three counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.049" offset="285845">Count one was in the nature of a resale price maintenance charge that S&amp;H issued stamps to retailers and required the retailers to dispense them to consumers in ratio of one stamp to each 10 cents worth of purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.795" offset="372885">Second count charged conspiracy to carry out this program, the 1:10 ratio and count three was in the nature of an unreasonable restraint on the alienation charge that is that S&amp;H carried out a policy of suppressing trading stamp exchanges and preventing anyone other than S&amp;H from redeeming S&amp;H stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.585" offset="479987">And this count also contained a charge of conspiracy by S&amp;H with other stamp firms to carry out this program.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.281" offset="518753">In all three counts, the complaint alleged that the practices were anti-competitive and to the detriment of the consuming public.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.897" offset="565251">Commission found violation under all three counts but S&amp;H appealed only on count three and the Fifth Circuit vacated the Commission's order in a 2:1 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.356" offset="631080">Judge Wisdom dissenting that majority decision is now here for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.671" offset="660337">There are two questions presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.141" offset="674234">The first principle question is whether the Fifth Circuit was in error in holding the FTC’s power under section five to declare particular methods of competition and particular acts and practices unfair is limited to conduct which violates the letter or the spirit of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.213" offset="770573">A subordinate question is whether the Commission erred as the Circuit Court seems to indicate in failing to give sufficient weight to decisions under State Law that operations of stamp exchanges and the retailers who redeemed S&amp;H stamps were unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.772" offset="860748">The government’s position on these two questions since the first one is that FTC’s power is not limited to declaring practices unfair simply when they are antitrust type of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.509" offset="923755">Rather, we think the Commission has a broad mandate to consider the circumstances of particular cases to determine what is unfair in the light of the public interest and without trying to define the outer limits of this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.203" offset="1002541">We think it is clear first that a practice maybe held unfair by FTC where it has analyzed all the facts and circumstances of particular case considered reasons for the practice, the need forth by the practitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.133" offset="1074221">Its impact on the various factors in Commerce and if FTC determines on this basis, that the practice may have or has had a significant adverse effect on competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.364" offset="1143184">Secondly, we think that the practice maybe held unfair where it is detrimental to the interest of the consuming public entirely without regard to the question of effect on competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.900" offset="1197310">On the second question, the State Law question, our position is that State Courts decisions on matters as between private parties are to be given little rate in a Government case where the issue involves the public interest and particularly where broad public policy considerations such as those found in Section 5 case are present.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.167" offset="1314338">I have no doubt that the arrangements for example in the Brown Shoe case and the Gasoline Company TBA cases were entirely legal under State Law but as the Court will recall, those arrangements had to give way to the overriding policy of the Federal Trade Commission Act and its intent to protect a competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.496" offset="1431680">Turning to the facts of the particular case, they are relatively simple and I think substantially undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.181" offset="1474417">S&amp;H is trading operation as the promotional service for retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.433" offset="1495419">Under the system S&amp;H licenses, limited number of retailers to handle its stamps in each area.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.844" offset="1533035">The retailers receives the stamps from S&amp;H on consignment and the retailers pay a service charge in proportion to the number of stamps they received.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.497" offset="1575667">This runs an average of $2.68 a book of 12 hundred stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.546" offset="1607850">The retailers in turn dispense the stamps to consumers in proportion to their purchases and this has been as I indicate earlier on a one for ten basis, one stamps to instant purchase and this book says, the S&amp;H book says is compensation for cash payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.174" offset="1702413">In other words, nature of the cash discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.938" offset="1717460">Consumers however are only authorized to paste the stamps in books and to redeem the books with S&amp;H for merchandise, nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.482" offset="1759569">The books worth about three dollars on redemption and merchandise and the record indicates that somewhere between 5% and 14% of stamps go unredeemed as the records shows also that as of 1964 there were several hundred million worth of unredeemed stamps outstanding.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="450.982" offset="1877643">I assume rather long, a long period of time?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_w_mclaren" startTime="453.602" stopTime="1089.893">
            <label>Mr. Richard W. Mclaren</label>
            <text syncTime="453.602" offset="1888092">A long period of time, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.016" offset="1897705">However, S&amp;H's purchases runs some 320 million a year and it growth recedes.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.082" offset="1942009">So this is more than a good bit more than one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.045" offset="1965832">Turning to the trading stamps industry, we find that is a rather concentrated one with six companies having some 85% of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.670" offset="2012330">Although, there are some total of 400 companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.919" offset="2025391">S&amp;H is a good bit bank, the number one in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.522" offset="2047752">About 40% of total industry receipts and some three times the size of its nearest competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.627" offset="2080144">Some 77 thousand retail outlets handle S&amp;H stamps and nearly 60% of all American households according to record sale S&amp;H stamps, that is around 35 million families.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.438" offset="2147435">To give an idea of the overall economic importance of stamps in 1964, the stamps of all kind were issued on 40 billion dollars worth purchases and on some 43% to 46% of all food store purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.341" offset="2223086">In some areas, it went as high as 95% and the record shows that RX 24 that where stamps are prevalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.468" offset="2267599">They tend to increase the level of retail prices and making the calculation of one stamp for a 10 cent purchase, this would come to about 2% on sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.439" offset="2323396">Coming to the main issue of trading stamps exchanges and the redeeming retailers, the record indicates that exchange is developed to meet the desire of consumers to get more out of the various stamps that they were receiving as a shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.336" offset="2403018">A good many housewives testified and I think it is fair to say from their testimony that they principally wanted to consolidate different stamps into one kind of a stamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.993" offset="2453695">This permitted them to go out and redeem.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.109" offset="2466129">They would not have to wait so long to fill up a single kind of stamp book.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.554" offset="2487863">They could get their Christmas presents or whatever it might be to fill an immediate need or in some cases they wanted to cash them in.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.587" offset="2524017">Perhaps they are leaving the part of the country where the stamps reused or they came to a part of the company where they were not in circulation, perhaps their military personnel going abroad, sometimes they wanted to get a better buy as they could get a better selection from one company stamp catalogs and from another or maybe the redemption center was more convenient. Within 25 miles you cannot mail in, you must come-in in person.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.032" offset="2653793">If you do not have a card perhaps there is another company with a more center.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.910" offset="2673333">In any event the exchanges grew up, the cumulative stocks of the different kinds of stamps as many as 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.919" offset="2709382">Different kinds would be stocked.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.212" offset="2718577">They would principally exchange and I think that was some 60% of their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.238" offset="2738639">They would also sell stamps to help somebody get the 7th book, if we had six together, we would get a particular item something in that order and they would buy stamps from people who wanted to sell as I indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.023" offset="2797780">They charged a fee of around 30 to 50 cents per book for exchanging and they also had varying prices perhaps they buy for a dollar-and-a-half a book and sell for two quarter at 275 per book.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.660" offset="2860369">The record also shows that small retailers got into the redemption business as a way of competing for business.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.410" offset="2895269">They would give credit for stamps on purchases, perhaps small items would not be carried in the catalogues, work clothing, baby clothing, shoes, the hose, and things like that or in another cases retailers would accept the stamps as down payments on bigger items comparable to those in the catalogues and this was the way that some of the appliance stores and small department stores had competing in effect with the redemption centers of S&amp;H.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.822" offset="3052944">They take the stamps as down payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.892" offset="3069244">Now, the pleadings and the evidence show that S&amp;H had a very strong program with regard to these exchangers and retailers handling the stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.877" offset="3133192">They tried in every way, I think one of the executives testified to prevent that.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.685" offset="3156389">They wrote hundreds of letters, they took court action to close down this kind of an operations and the record shows that they were quite successful in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.256" offset="3202678">The businesses of some of the exchange or exchanges enjoined from handling as to make stamps dropped of 40% to 60%.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.272" offset="3242802">Some closed down completely and many redeeming retailers stopped handling stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.867" offset="3273104">Some consumers testified that they would give or throw stamps away in the absence of exchanges because if you had to take through the whole length of time on a single brand, it just took too long to work that.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.240" offset="3338619">Now S&amp;H is just occasion for its program was given through the testimony of a Doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.393" offset="3367249">One Director that the free exchange and redemption by others would break the relationship between S&amp;H and retailers and the consumer, would reduce the incentive of shoppers to patronize the S&amp;H retailers to fill their books and it would reduce or eliminate this to redemption centers and over all would reduce the tie of the consumer to S&amp;H.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.836" offset="3481039">This would in turn cause the retailer to lose interest in S&amp;H and they anticipated that they would lose their licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.653" offset="3516252">S&amp;H did not offer any evidence that this in fact happened in any of these areas where the exchanges or the redeeming retailers operated in a number of them who testified were still on operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.074" offset="3569960">They had not been enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.304" offset="3582916">S&amp;H showed no loss of licensees nor even complaints by licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.414" offset="3611338">No retailer took the stand to indicate that he had any loss of consumer business in the areas where the exchanges or other retailers were redeeming.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.380" offset="3659194">Many housewives testified although they used the exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.890" offset="3677271">This did not lessen their buying at S&amp;H stores to change their shopping habits in any way and other evidence shows also that stamps are insignificant factor with housewives in deciding where to shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.088" offset="3737979">In other words they decided where to shop based on price and specials on convenient and quality of the need or produced from this for particular basic goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.659" offset="3788343">Many things other than stamps although a survey did show that some 16% of people will go out of the way to get particular stamps but only 16%.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.529" offset="3843827">Now FTC’s decision on these facts is based on what I think it is fair to say as the rule of reason approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.082" offset="3881966">They considered this, it is a very lengthy record.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.042" offset="3893878">Many thousand of pages, they considered the justification of his claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.977" offset="3913627">They considered the need for this restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.515" offset="3927733">Mandate considered particularly the impact of the restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.022" offset="3957721">They found no good business reason for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.810" offset="3968902">They found no necessity for the restriction and they held that the fears of S&amp;H as officers, that they would lose licensees and so on were entitled the very little weight because they are in general terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.972" offset="4029610">They weren't backed up by hard tracks and because they were contrary to the other evidence that S&amp;H in fact had not been heard and they saw no signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.936" offset="4065450">It would be heard by the extremes and to out or by retailers, the redemptions in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.924" offset="4089378">I think there is good precedent for rejecting that kind of testimony in here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.420" offset="4107351">I would to the Court's holding sold off a bank’s, where the opinions of Bank officers as to adverse effect on competition from the merger so that competition would be entered and so on, was not given very weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.319" offset="4166910">FTC’s ultimate finding here was that the effect of S&amp;H practices in quoting was to fair, unfairly suppress such exchanges and the business of such retailers to the detriment of the persons engaged therein and the consuming public and be to substantially impair and restraining competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.628" offset="4272235">The commission concluded that the act in practices were ”to the prejudice and injury of the public that they unreasonably restrained, injured and impaired competition and thereby were unfair under Section 5.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.737" offset="4340676">I think it is important to note that both the complaint and complaint counsel's theory of the case throughout emphasize this restrictive policy on exchange and redemption had an unreasonable impact on the consuming public as well as an adverse effect on competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1206.030" offset="4897816">Well, as the matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.838" offset="4913071">We think that the Commission in this case could have based its decision on either of these two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.443" offset="4939403">The adverse effect on competition or the detrimental effect upon the consuming public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.251" offset="4966675">As to the first ground, I think at least since Brown Shoe where the Gratz rule was official entered, this Court has recognized that although ultimate responsibility risks with the Courts, Congress has reposed on FTC very broad powers to give content to the term 'unfair' and to determine at exactly what point when a practice is otherwise lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.341" offset="5083076">At what point in its effect upon competition, the practice becomes unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.415" offset="5103347">As the Court said on the text called TBA case, “it is enough that the practice in question unfairly burden competition were not insignificant volume of commerce”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.730" offset="5156637">And here I think that standard was not only met but substantially exceeded since the commission found that with respect to exchanges, S&amp;H had an exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.424" offset="5207419">Monopoly power over the trading stamps exchanges and they intended to eliminate a whole class of small businessman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.009" offset="5241692">As far as the retailers are concerned, they found that there is a restorative trade on these retailers and found stamps and other way of competing and serving their customers and those two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.132" offset="5306162">I think fully support the commission on the anti competitive ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.190" offset="5326433">As far as the unfairness for being detrimental to the interest of the public, I think that is fully supported as Judge Wisdom pointed out in its dissent, it was a very purpose of the Wheeler-Lea Amendment in 1938 to establish this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.874" offset="5409189">The legislative history which Judge Wisdom outlined, various lower Federal Court decisions which we have listed in our briefs and the commission itself and of course under the rules of this Court and the commissions interpretation of its own statute is entitled to a great deal of way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.305" offset="5486929">The commission has interpreted a statute in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.416" offset="5507305">All in support of this particular proposition that whether it is adverse affect on the consuming public, there needn't be in effect, adverse effect on competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.954" offset="5557460">In fact, FTC in a very analytical opinion going into the matter very carefully based its holding on both of these propositions and under the test applicable on these appeals, we think it is warranted in the record and there is reason in the law to support it and we would urge for these reasons that the Court reverse the decisions of Fifth Circuit and remand for a judgment.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1742.019" offset="7041738">Thank you, Mr. Mclaren.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.937" offset="7053440">Mr. Russell?</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold L. Russell</label>
            <text syncTime="1747.065" offset="7061904">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.849" offset="7081026">At the outset, I would like to note that actually the only paragraph of the order with which we are concerned is paragraph 5 which appears at pages 127, 128 of joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.224" offset="7146541">All we want to do is to be able as I have said unilaterally and all by our selves to go to Court as we have done for 75 years to protect the quality and integrity of our stamp business by stopping unauthorized trafficking in stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.558" offset="7227938">S&amp;H is in the business of licensing retail merchants to use its sales promotion system which is based upon the use of S&amp;H trading stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.572" offset="7267958">Retail merchants subscribe to that service to increase trade and to maintain and enhance customer loyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.836" offset="7300977">They use stamps to get their customers to return to their stores again and again until they have collected enough stamps to secure redemption merchandise of their choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.942" offset="7353431">Throughout the history of this company, non licensed retailers, stamps exchangers have attempted to cash in on the S&amp;H system without paying for the S&amp;H service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.920" offset="7401391">By purchasing, exchanging and making other Commercial use of S&amp;H stamps without S&amp;H authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.634" offset="7436187">Now the reason we have consistently sought judicial relief and the reason why the Courts have enjoined it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.249" offset="7462727">Is that if competing merchants were free to redeem S&amp;H stamps issued by S&amp;H licensees for their own merchandise or they could exchange S&amp;H stamps for their own stamps or the consumers could get stamps of trading stamps exchanges rather than as a licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.213" offset="7542557">The S&amp;H system had lost its attraction for the licensees to after all of the people who pay S&amp;H for the use of its service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.569" offset="7575994">In fact, in the case of unauthorized redeeming retailer, the S&amp;H system could be turned into an instrument to introduce the S&amp;H licensee’s customers to the store of a non licensed competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.368" offset="7639106">This is a basic reason why the Court of equity has consistently granted judicial relief to S&amp;H against unauthorized traffickers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.753" offset="7672647">Holding at these traffickers have been engaged in unfair competition and tortuous interference with S&amp;H contractual and business relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.837" offset="7712980">The central question presented in this case is whether S&amp;H actions in preventing the unauthorized commercial use of its trading stamps by obtaining judicial relief against the abuse constitutes an unfair practice violating Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.401" offset="7779331">The petitioner’s main argument is that S&amp;H actions violate section 5 and that because of the Court restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.514" offset="7807752">S&amp;H stamps savers do not have complete freedom of choice in the transfer of their stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.130" offset="7834188">This is alleged to be unfair to consumers who are said thereby to be deprived of the full value of the stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.443" offset="7867416">S&amp;H contends on other hand that the challenged actions are essential to this successful conduct of its business for the reasons previously stated and the worst that could be said with regard to consumers that appealed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.795" offset="7924885">The record does not show how many appealed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.357" offset="7935125">Maybe inconvenience by S&amp;H actions and preventing of stamp traffickers from offering to purchase or redeem stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.965" offset="7969502">I might say the reason show or the reason why the record shows, no experience in the matter of injury to S&amp;H by the activity of these traffickers is that the Courts over a period of 67 years have restrained the activity of the exchanges on an unauthorized redeeming retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.328" offset="8058946">Although there are other defects in the Commissions decision which would preclude the affirmance as requested by petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.226" offset="8102622">There are really two fundamental effects in petitioner’s position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.553" offset="8119863">First is that the Commission did not make findings of unfairness or inconvenience to consumers which the petitioner alleges would support its request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.010" offset="8165734">Secondly, if the Commission had made findings on accordance with petitioner’s contentions even if they had gone that far, they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.579" offset="8200007">The findings were not support of conclusion that S&amp;H is conduct violated Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.874" offset="8225189">In short, the requested order, petitioners requested order would be beyond the scope of Section 5 and upside the jurisdiction of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.603" offset="8272105">It has never before been suggested that inconvenience could be a basis for determination that Section 5 has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.681" offset="8324454">The Commission, in fact purported to decide only an unfair competition case and entire competition case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.581" offset="8356010">Not an unfair to consumer’s case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.274" offset="8366773">It found that the action of S&amp;H in stopping unauthorized trafficking in its stamps was an unfair method of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.203" offset="8398538">We appeal an argument really made the Fifth Circuit foreign to any arguments which you heard today but they are to remain to the basic issue before you which was the decision of the Commission tracked, it should be confirmed, affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.965" offset="8473561">Now, the errors which we urged upon the Fifth Circuit in which are reasons why this Commission decision should not be affirmed or one, that a most flagrant error of the Commission was that it pointedly ignored the 43 decisions of the Courts and 8 Federal Districts and 19 States upholding unanimously our practice of proceeding against commercial practices and it likewise ignored the statutes of four States which make trafficking a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.456" offset="8607517">Now, we say that the Commission should have considered those decisions and found them controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.891" offset="8633222">The petitioner’s come a little bit to our view this morning and it said that they should be given some weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.781" offset="8664778">But on either standards, the Commissions decision is wrong because it did not consider those decisions at all and it pointedly ignored them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.387" offset="8711275">Secondly, the Commission decision is an error because it says that the simple matter of writing letters in good faith, followed up with necessary by Court action based upon unfair competition that is a simple matter of going to Court constituted conduct, contravening section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.285" offset="8802809">The third thing that is wrong of this Commission decision is that the Commission erroneously fail to consider that the traffickers themselves as determined by the 43 Court decisions in the State statutes are engaged in unlawful activity and therefore they are not entitled to the protection of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.102" offset="8878041">And finally and this was an egregious error in the Commission decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.858" offset="8897163">That Commission erroneously ignored the effect of its action on competition among and between Trading Stamp Companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.884" offset="8925166">We said that the Commissions decision would make all brands of stamps interchangeable and would destroy trading stamp competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.565" offset="8955991">The Court of Appeal agreed with this and it as did the Commission considered the case as one involving anticompetitive practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.938" offset="8989427">It pointed out that all are fairly challenged to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.562" offset="8999876">The Commission had been unable to point that any antitrust law which S&amp;H has violated even in letter and spirit and that the efforts of S&amp;H to prevent that which time and time had been declared unlawful, did not constitute practices of the type which transgresses the spirit of antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.252" offset="9078662">Fifth Circuit said that mere injury to traffickers was not enough to establish violation of Section 5, that the Commission itself had pointed out that trading stamps are involved on means of competitions at the retail level to come on integral and important part of retailing in America and they went on to agree with us that the order of the Commission would make all stamps interchangeable and would reduce as against other trading stamp companies the effectiveness of S&amp;H as competitive too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.392" offset="9207289">Now, in seeking certiorari, the petitioner presented two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.027" offset="9233829">One as to whether the Court of Appeals restricted erroneously Section 5 conduct which violates the letters, sphere of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.612" offset="9272177">And secondly, which the petitioner restated this morning which was did the Commission err in failing to give sufficient weight to decisions under State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.804" offset="9320869">That was as it was presented this morning and indicated whether under petitioner’s view of that or our view, the Commission was wrong or it did not consider at all 43 decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.528" offset="9383772">Now, in some the petitioners urging you to affirm the decision of the Commission upon the basis of evidence which is not in the record before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.504" offset="9443644">Upon the basis of evidence not considered by the Commission, upon the basis of findings not made by the Commission and upon the basis of legal theories without support in the legislative history of Section 5 are in the decisions with the Court or in the decisions of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.927" offset="9553359">Some of the things that I think that are important, in this context is petitioners claim that the Commission found that S&amp;H's activity in stopping traffickers was to the detriment of the traffickers and also to the consuming public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.423" offset="9635383">Now, therefore that the prejudice and injury of the consuming public.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.824" offset="9648967">Now, those so called findings are not findings in any sense but are wholly naked, ultimate conclusions and are in fact there is simply mechanical repetitions of the conclusions contained in the original complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.024" offset="9717826">They are found on the 89 or 90 so called findings and then the second of a three conclusions and they are preceded by no discussion of any evidence of consumer injury by no mention of consumer injury, by no basic or underlying findings and more importantly they found, they form no basis for the action of the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="2655.975" offset="10697627">Now, the big point is that the commission itself did not consider any way to evidence as to the fact of S&amp;H actions upon consumers and since the Commission did not make a determination of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.366" offset="10771187">A large part of the petitioner’s argument has been taken up with the request that Supreme Court consider evidence not considered by the Commission that you make findings not made by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.114" offset="10818103">For example, the petitioner urges you to find that the cost of groceries is ordinarily higher but recalls stamps are issued by retailers, when stamps are issued by retailer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2700.772" offset="10876722">There was not more quest to do so by complaint counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.890" offset="10889261">As a matter of fact, complaint counsel asked the Commission to find that stamps reduced prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.530" offset="10923847">I think it is just absolutely wrong for the petitioner to be coming here and saying, find the stamps raised prices when a contrary finding was asked to the Commission, and a matter of fact that 158 your Honors, the Commission found that stamps reflect a price reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.806" offset="11036905">Now, petitioner also asked you to make a finding not made by the Commission that under the order a higher percentage of stamps would be redeemed and that consumers as a whole would thereby get greater benefits from the stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.453" offset="11099494">Now the fact is that such a finding was requested by complaint counsel before the Commission refused to make such a finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.176" offset="11146410">And the fact is that the Commission conceded that is much as 95% of S&amp;H stamps are redeemed or maybe redeemed and there is no support in the record, petitioners cites the assumption that a higher percentage would be redeemed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.689" offset="11212448">Over an unchallenged finding, the examiner stated that competition forces S&amp;H to invest the value of unredeemed stamps and greater values for savers and licensees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.023" offset="11257796">And Your Honor, the unredeemed stamps of which petitioner spoke amounted to 14% of those outstanding which were almost precisely the same in number as those issued in the preceding year and the record shows that there is a year lag between the issuance and redemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.635" offset="11352255">As a matter of fact 13% were issued in the year 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.670" offset="11372317">The last year involved in this Compilation and here we have a situation where 95% of the people are getting a $3 redemption value for $2.68 cents cost to the retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.836" offset="11441071">We have a situation where we had seven consumer witnesses out of 35 million households who save S&amp;H stamps, we have a situation where even those seven consumer witnesses did not complain about S&amp;H practices, where a situation which they say that the most is more convenient sometimes for them to use the trading stamp exchange than it is to redeem their stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.122" offset="11554129">Now, the petitioner asked you to make other findings not made by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.653" offset="11572311">Such as this business about the man who owns no cart and not get to the redemption center but the examiner found and it would not dispute it that even if a man as within the 25 mile range of a redemption center which is inconvenient for them to get to the center.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.626" offset="11640229">He can and does redeem by mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.970" offset="11653604">That appears at pages 39 and 46 at the record before you, I could go on on others things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.310" offset="11678890">As a matter of fact the last night, I did a compilation from the respondent’s briefs and I found that they have asked you at least 50 times to consider smatterings of evidence not considered by the Commission and they have asked you at least six or eight times such as in this matter of effect on price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.158" offset="11778260">This matter of greater number redemptions to make findings which they recognize are essential to their position and which the Commission itself did not make.</text>

            <text syncTime="3001.736" offset="12080653">Now, on this question is has no difference between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.480" offset="12095595">Obviously Section 5 is not so limited since its enactment Section 5 has been held a black not only to antitrust like conduct but also the deceptive practices and other forms of unfair conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.396" offset="12155259">The real question before the Court is how far can the Commission go in holding a practice which is not deceptive or in the nature of an unfair, of antitrust violation to be unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.323" offset="12210952">Are there any limits at all that the Commission have unrestricted of authority to condemned practices simply because it is of the opinion that they are not beneficial to add beneficial consumers as some modification might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.030" offset="12269780">Now, when Section 5 was originally enacted, many were afraid that the language of a statute was too broad and in congressional debates, the daughters were reassured that unfairness of the competition actually had some limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.005" offset="12349715">And it was even said that the practice is covered or to be limit of those which shock the universal conscience of mankind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.740" offset="12384614">Now it is more than interesting to note.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.564" offset="12391929">Your Honor that one of the unfair practices referred to in the debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.927" offset="12421395">As being an unfair practices was that of inducing savers of S&amp;H stamps to fill an trade their unfilled books of S&amp;H stamps for the stamps of another company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.761" offset="12476774">That was a reference for the case of S&amp;H versus Louie Weber and under the Commission's order in this case we could not bring that case which we brought in 1908 and which Congress said represented the type of unfair competition, unfair practice case with Section 5 was suppose to cover.</text>

            <text syncTime="3161.697" offset="12720444">The Court said, it does not appear that happened very much but the point is that under this Commission order, this rascal could sell these stamps back to our licensees.</text>

            <text syncTime="3428.834" offset="13789062">This Court affirmed the Commission's decision and gave you the reasons why it would be grossly inappropriate for the Court to take that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.976" offset="13829604">Not to be repetitive but the Commission pointedly ignored the 43 decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.421" offset="13855413">The Commission erred in saying when we wrote letters in a good faith and brought litigation in good faith we were transgressing Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.113" offset="13890103">The Commission erred in failing to consider that the traffickers themselves are engaged in unlawful activity and therefore entitled to no protection under Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.825" offset="13932944">The Commission erred in over ruling its hearing examiner and holding that S&amp;H is not harmed by unauthorized trafficking in their stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.824" offset="13968993">It erred in ignoring the fact that its action would destroy competition among and between the trading stamp companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.048" offset="14001907">As petitioner appears to concede by its argument here, the decision can not be affirmed unless the Supreme Court of United States made factual findings on injury to consumers not made by the Commission and more importantly as petitioner appears to concede that an order can not be affirmed unless you conclude contrary to all authority and contrary to the Commission's broadest interpretation of its jurisdiction under Section 5 that inconvenience to consumers constitutes the violation of that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.668" offset="14140356">Now, finally and I believe, also importantly, the Commission's action could not be affirmed upon the basis not relied upon by the Commission, namely alleged harm to consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.220" offset="14198557">A factor which has been stated by you in Burlington,Chenery lately an investment company, that the order may not be affirmed upon the basis of appellate counsel's post rationalizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.829" offset="14252996">Now, the Commission is here your Honors is in my view, only because it is seeking a sweeping exposition of its powers in the consumers field and must be obvious to you I hope, that these case which was instituted at 1965, six years ago today, and tried in 1966 before this Commission became so acutely consumer conscience that this case is only in actuality (Inaudible) of a case out of which the Commissions desire that first decision can not be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.481" offset="14427599">The Commission had never found that this matter of injury to consumers even initially justified that institution of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.275" offset="14478799">As you heard this morning, there were three counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.608" offset="14492069">This count although of great importance to us, was a small tail on a large dog.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.503" offset="14527700">The Commission was primarily concerned with 1:10 was a conspiracy with respect to 1:10 and it would be to me shocking that this act or thought, bowl or plate pranked in mechanical reproduction of the complaint as to consumer injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.566" offset="14611919">Without discussion of the facts of consumer injury could be found to support this decision of the Commission and even if we took the case to the point where petitioner, I think ended when he was questioned this morning that the Commission's decision should be affirmed because anti-competitive problems as well as consumers problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.117" offset="14738142">You recall that when the Commission relies upon several factors and put some into conjunctive and one falls they all falls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.310" offset="14786939">On the matter of injury to competition, the Fifth Circuit was entirely right and the petitioners pointed out no reasons why in this anticompetitive aspect of the case, the Fifth Circuit should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3800.280" offset="15274802">Chief Justice, on the other hand, I think where we follow the standard on judicial review, if we look for warrant in the record and reason in law and I think there is warrant in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.257" offset="15322658">This count three came at the end of the very long opinion that dealt in many respects with this whole stamp business and restrictive practices that S&amp;H used and the fact I think that count three does not fully contain every little finding should not be read in isolation but rather the opinion should be looked at as a whole and as well as the fact that there is record support for these propositions that I think are inherent in the lengthy findings and the opinion of the prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3859.314" offset="15510949">Well, the heart of the case is double findings that there is an adverse effect on competition, that there is an adverse effect on the consuming public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.678" offset="15552431">I think that that if the Commission had taken the approach solely of going by the proposition of the legal consequence of S&amp;H having eliminated these outlets and focussed entirely on the fact that now all these outlets are out of the way, they have this restriction in the book that says you do not own the stamp and so on and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.632" offset="15632157">We find that just an ultimate finding, this has prevented consumers from dealing freely with stamps. This is an unfair method of competition or an unfair trade practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.996" offset="15673640">I think that would have been enough but they did both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.573" offset="15683984">On the way to that finding, on the way to the consumer finding they said this has an adverse effect on competition that in effect will support an unfair holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.994" offset="15729646">They are supported both ways and I do not think that say should be folded simply because they did not spell out the fact that here and they are along the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.102" offset="15770084">This effect and not effect on the consumer, the effect on the consumer was tied in with the effect on the competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.159" offset="15798296">The two things, the restrictive provision in the stamp and the elimination of the places where you could trade the stamps.</text>

            <text syncTime="3956.602" offset="15900069">The only issue directly before us now but nonetheless we should sort of assume that there is an implicit incorporation by reference of the discussion in the earlier part of its opinion which is the lion share of the opinion, is that your point now?</text>
