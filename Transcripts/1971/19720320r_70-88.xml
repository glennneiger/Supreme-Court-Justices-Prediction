            <label>Mr. Geoffrey Creyke, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="38.649" offset="228289">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.581" offset="239992">This case is also here for re-argument, and it comes from the United States Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.945" offset="261517">It involves the finality under a 1961 Federal Construction Contract of an administrative disputes decision favorable to the contractor, allowing payment for certain routine contract changes, which decision was accepted by the contractor and by the agency, the Atomic Energy Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.020" offset="337795">What was collaterally attacked by the Comptroller General on his own initiative precluding payment and forcing us to suit in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.269" offset="370813">There is no issue as to the authority to enter the contract, obligate funds or indeed to conduct the disputes process.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.092" offset="402056">Neither is there any allegation of any fraud, wrongdoing or impropriety whatsoever on the part of anyone connected with the contractor or the AEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.829" offset="441031">The matter is simply one in which we say the Comptroller General in an overreaching of his powers has blocked payment of the resolution of this matter under the disputes process, forcing the contractor into litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.707" offset="504560">The Department of Justice here, takes the position that the action of the Comptroller General is immaterial and although it is not supported by the Atomic Energy Commission in it's pursuit of this, nevertheless contends that this creates a right of judicial review of this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.837" offset="577076">The case was decided by the Court of Claims in a 4 to 3 Opinion, the majority holding that regardless of what precipitated the litigation, there would be a judicial review conducted under the standards of the Wunderlich Act of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.864" offset="645204">And the case was remanded to the Commissioner of the Court of Claims for hearing on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.941" offset="669445">Therefore the case is not here on the merits as such, but on the question of the finality of this determination under the disputes process and the rights of the contract, to which he is asserting to hold that disputes process having been accepted by the agency was final.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.154" offset="742275">And it is not subject to collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.548" offset="751888">The case therefore involves a contract between the agencies and an interpretation of this Wunderlich Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.234" offset="786683">If I may briefly review the history of the case itself, it is laid out as a chronology on page one of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.838" offset="821060">It was a Lump sum competitively bid Federal construction contract to build a portion of the Atomic Reactive Test Station for the navy in Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.517" offset="867767">The original sum was $1,272,000 and the contract performance period was 180 days or to run from August 1961 to February 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.116" offset="914160">The contract was entered into on a US Standard Form 23, 23A and so forth, well with the contact of the 1953 edition with the normal and usual act, with adjustment clauses for changes, change conditions and other factors in the contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.847" offset="985109">It worked, however, due to extra work and extra time, actually consumed 325 days or in effect approximately double the time of performance and the expenditures involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.923" offset="1033383">Six claims arose out of this and amounting to $1,950,000 and claims for an additional 120 days in time extensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.901" offset="1073298">They are routine claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.320" offset="1078941">Nothing extraordinary other than the magnitude of them in relation to the basic contract and the type of thing that is encountered in almost all federal construction contacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.947" offset="1117498">Denied by the Contracting Officer, a timely appeal taken, they were referred by the Atomic Energy Commission under it's then existing practice to an examiner, who heard in a 13-day hearing, the claims in an adversary proceeding found in December of 1962, for the appellant here on liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.603" offset="1204120">The matter was remanded by him to the contacting officer to negotiate quantum.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.095" offset="1226062">The Contacting Officer appealed to the commission itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.456" offset="1239542">This proceeding to this extent being a little different from your normal Board of Contract Appeals type of proceeding which is prevalent throughout most of the Federal departments today.</text>

            <text syncTime="308.944" offset="1309445">On November 1963, the full Commission reaffirmed some of the claims and granted a review by the full Commission on several, mostly pertaining to time extensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.184" offset="1358451">In May 14, 1963, the Commission itself in a formal act affirmed the claims other than a slight modification on one regarding time of site access which it remanded for negotiation, and directed the contract --</text>

            <text syncTime="350.999" offset="1477674">There was this remand to the contracting officer again in May of 1963 then by the full Commission, but in the meanwhile the dispersing officer had addressed an inquiry to the General Accounting Office regarding certain set offs involving about $32,000, items which were independent of the merits of the claims themselves, so found by the Commissioner of Court of Claims who reported on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.739" offset="1580701">But the request which went to the General Accounting Office expressly stated that it was not to be construed as a request for a review of or concurrence in the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.702" offset="1628557">Nevertheless the General Accounting Office did contending that it had a right acting in an executive capacity and under the standard of the Wunderlich Act to review the entire decision, did so taking 33 months to do it and in a 260-page opinion, set aside the entire decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.025" offset="1713821">It allowed not one set, it allowed not one day's time extension and in it's own papers filed in these proceedings, it characterizes this action as an advanced notice of dis-allowance.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>

            <label>Mr. Irving Jaffe</label>
            <text syncTime="1928.790" offset="7788858">In the normal course of events as happens with all of these contracts, the matter would have been continued and concluded before the contracting officer which was where the Atomic Energy Commission is centered, presumably an amount that was due, since they found the government liable on several of the claims, would have ultimately been determined and paid by the agency's disbursing or certifying officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.086" offset="7890004">However, I would like to answer the question that was posed by Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.760" offset="7908707">Suppose that the disbursing officer had not paid, this is not a hypothetical situation, except for this particular case because the disbursing officer of another agency, not so long ago refused to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.289" offset="7970879">I say that mandamus would not lie, it's not a ministerial act because that decision which the disbursing officer refused to pay could be subjected to challenge by the very device of refusing to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.013" offset="8021765">It is not a decision which requires payment unless it is one which is not fraudulent, not arbitrary or capricious, not clearly so erroneous as to imply bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.215" offset="8070562">It must be supported by substantial evidence and one step more, it must be correct as a matter of law that Section 320, the second section of the Wunderlich Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.090" offset="8110059">So that on any of these grounds, there is no -- if there is -- any of those grounds are not met, there is no requirement to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.608" offset="8144123">Now the disbursing officer assuming that he came to the conclusion that this decision was infirm under the standards of the Wunderlich Act, could not be compelled in mandamus in my opinion to pay, it is not a ministerial act required and the case that be subjected to judicial scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.924" offset="8217370">In this case, there has not yet been a determination by a court of competent jurisdiction, namely the Court of Claims that this decision of the Atomic Energy Commission has any viability whatever or that any payment is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.364" offset="8271182">The reason it has not reached that decision is because the plaintiff has contended and this Court has granted certiorari that the standards of the Wunderlich Act are available only to the contractor, that there was nothing under the Wunderlich Act which enabled the government to challenge the decision of its own agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="2087.000" offset="8421648">The government as Congress in Willis said, when the question was posed to it in the consideration of the Wunderlich Act, said that it might be the General Accounting Office, it might be the Department of Justice, it might be the agency involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.690" offset="8476505">Now let us assume, for example, another means by which this could have come to court and how the government would have asserted its rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.519" offset="8503777">Suppose, for example, the disbursing officer did pay as what have been true in a normal course of events, and then the General Accounting Office in auditing these accounts looks at this decision and comes to the conclusion that it's erroneous as a matter of law on the basis of the decision on its face and therefore transmits it to the Department of Justice with the request that we look into for the purpose of recouping money erroneously or illegally paid because the decision of an agency, under a Disputes Clause was not entitled to finality under the Wunderlich Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.256" offset="8654765">Now that would be another way as the Attorney General said in his opinion of January 6, 1969 in which this could be tested.</text>

            <text syncTime="2746.424" offset="11059388">I think the most usual way would be by failing to pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="2817.531" offset="11343809">Somebody in the agency and it has to be someone high up because we do not accept communications from trial attorneys or lower stafficial ones, there is someone in the general counsel's office or an assistant secretary will write to us and say they are disturbed about an opinion as did Mason, as did FAA, as did several agencies, and the question they asked us is not to intervene in the disputes process, as the petitioner would have you believe, the decision has already been rendered.</text>

            <text syncTime="3119.750" offset="12552652">The legislative history of course, as some lawyer in the field once said has a little bit of everything for everybody and therefore it's little confusing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.556" offset="12583894">What we had originally was a proposal, a Wunderlich Act proposal, which would have included the GAO equally with the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.092" offset="12614092">That was deleted and the GAO was taken out and the word Court was taken out, but we still speak of the judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.390" offset="12643245">It was quite clear, we say, from the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.757" offset="12656724">Two things were quite clear, that this access to the Courts for judicial review under the standard that they were setting forth was available to both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.755" offset="12692668">The reason that I say that it was aware is because there were bills before the Congress, including one presented by the American Bar Association specifically to limit this judicial review to the contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.451" offset="12739480">The Congress did not accept any of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.120" offset="12750138">There were debates on whether or not this wouldn't be equally available to the government as well as the contractor and that the Congress had indicated that they thought it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.115" offset="12790157">There is no suggestion that it isn't available to them and there is certainly nothing on the face of the Act which indicates that it is available only to the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.341" offset="12831013">The Act itself would seem to make that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.033" offset="12841880">It says any decision of the head of the department and any such decision shall only have finality, if it is not fraudulent or capricious, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.169" offset="12886392">Now it doesn't say any decision adverse to a contractor and I don't think that, that should be read in, particularly in the light of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.514" offset="12923800">It is also strange, it seems to me, that the argument should be made, that the Wunderlich Act actually provides with two standards; one standard for the contractor which covers this entire panoply of broadened standards and quite another for the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.244" offset="12990673">The government is limited to fraud and overreaching, that is precisely what it was the Wunderlich Act was seeking to overcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.955" offset="13021498">As a matter of fact, if that were true, then the language of the Wunderlich Act, which says that no provision of any contract shall limit any decision of a head of an agency or of a Board of Contract Appeals to fraud, would again have to be interpolated as meaning only as against the contractor's complaint, but it could be so limited as far as the government was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.969" offset="13109582">I submit that there is nothing in the language, nothing in the history, nothing in logic which would call for that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.435" offset="13135391">I submit that the government should have and does have equal access to the courts to challenge the decisions of an agency head or of a Board of Contract Appeal on the basis set forth in the Wunderlich Act, that is that the standards there have not been met, that no finality should therefore attach to the decision and therefore, no payment, if one is ordered should legally or lawfully be made under such a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.633" offset="13244270">Now the question that's raised, who is the government?</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.660" offset="13256286">I have answered in the only way that I can, the normal way in which the government gets a case into Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.709" offset="13280528">Now that could be done normally in one of the three ways I suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.680" offset="13296410">I don't think we need to look for any others, that's ample protection for the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.633" offset="13312188">The payment can be made as the Attorney General said and we can seek to recoup it in a private suit of our own, if it in fact was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.653" offset="13344267">Now we would have to test in that suit in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3338.016" offset="13425769">The way that -- frankly, the way in which the government's access to the Courts has arisen in the past most frequently has been where a contractor submits several claims to a Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.498" offset="13471640">The Board rules in the contractor's favor with respect to three or four of them and rules against him with respect to two or three of them and he is to satisfy with the two or three, which have been adverse to him and he institutes a suit in the Court of Claims seeking to set aside the Board's decision with respect to those which were adverse and we in defending again, what is the entire record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.058" offset="13565889">We come to the conclusion that the Board was correct in denying the two or three it did, but was incorrect in allowing two of the four that they had allowed because it wasn't supported, let's say by substantial evidence or was erroneous as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.290" offset="13626807">We have done that in many, many instances and we have been successful and in some.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.139" offset="13646242">Now that's merely another manner in which the government has asserted its right to test a decision rendered under the Disputes Clause, under the standards of the Wunderlich Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.462" offset="13691591">Now in this particular case, payment was stopped, that's happened before too and then the contractor goes into Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.989" offset="13725654">Had we paid this one, we would never have been able to recoup it because we can't recoup it from a bank and (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="3568.270" offset="14346742">He really doesn't have three tiers to overcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.618" offset="14360221">All he has, if it please you Mr. Justice Blackmun -- first, the General Accounting Office is never a threat to the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.000" offset="14397733">He needn't wait one moment for the General Accounting Office to have or to consider the advance opinion or any advance request from any disbursing or certifying officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.417" offset="14439320">He can go into Court immediately he hears that the General Accounting Office's views has been solicited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.806" offset="14460949">So the General Accounting Office provides no tier to him at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.432" offset="14475473">It is one mean for the government to be aware that there may be an illegal payment about to made or if it is made to recoup it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.665" offset="14512358">That's the manner in which the General Accounting Office entered the picture but it's not a tier of review as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.012" offset="14541720">Now, the Department of Justice comes in only if an agency should decide to ask the department first, will you defend us or in this case for example, where the Comptroller General has issued an opinion in which he says that this would be an invalid payment, the agent -- the head of the department could come in and say to us, do I have to listen to the Comptroller General?</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.990" offset="14637641">And we could as we have as recently as 1969, told the agencies your accountable officers need not hear to the Comptroller General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.253" offset="14670660">We think you can make the payment, and we so direct you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.412" offset="14683303">So that -- I don't know to what extent these tiers are review, really are administrative hurdles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.494" offset="14715695">All it is really is, do we have a basis for defending a suit or for prosecuting a suit, and neither of them do I think the Court should assume that the contractor is entitled to money, any money or any payment until the Court has had opportunity to scrutinize that decision under the standards of the Wunderlich Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.431" offset="14807437">Until then, it is not a order or a decision in types of the finality which requires any payment.</text>
