            <text syncTime="33.428" offset="207365">This case is here on certiorari to the appeal provision of the Supreme Court of the State of New York which affirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court Bronx County convicting Santobello, the petitioner of possession of Gambling Records in the Second Degree as a misdemeanor upon his plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.931" offset="305377">The issue before this Court is whether or not but for a promise --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="65.203" offset="334530">Right.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="65.712" stopTime="186.738">
            <label>Mr. Irving Anolik</label>
            <text syncTime="65.712" offset="336515">-- which admittedly was articulated by the Assistant District Attorney to refrain from any recommendation with respect to sentence, Santobello would have pled guilty in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.461" offset="379565">We maintain that is the only issue before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.862" offset="397119">At the trial level, the Executive Assistant Mr. Rodka(ph) when asked whether or not a promise had been articulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.489" offset="439646">That is when he was asked before the sentencing judge said that the minutes of the plea did not reveal any such promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.571" offset="475904">Although he had been personally present at the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.041" offset="493876">Commendably, Mr. Sullivan who was Chief of the Appeals Bureau of that office inquired of Assistant District Attorney Greenfield who had been also present at the plea of guilty with Mr. Rodka and he notified Mr. Sullivan that such a promise had indeed been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.224" offset="582588">And that in the briefs before this Court as they were before the appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York, there is a concession that the promise had in fact been made and broken.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.214" offset="630549">We respectfully maintain that had Mr. Rodka, the Executive Assistant, told Justice Gelanoff who was the sentencing judge in this case that the promise in fact had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.002" offset="689690">One, Justice Gelanoff probably would have permitted a withdrawal of the plea of guilty or two, certainly under the American Bar Associations standards, the District Attorney would have been bound to have assisted the defendant in withdrawing his plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.017" offset="761788">Instead the impression was left with Justice Gelanoff that no such promise had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.426" offset="791359">Direct application on appeal was more solace to Santobello.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.030" offset="809749">Now, in the course of the proceedings --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="186.738" offset="820616">Now, the promise was that the prosecutor would make no recommendation with respect to Santobello.</text>

            <label>Mr. Irving Anolik</label>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="196.491" offset="859591">That was the length and breadth of the promise.</text>

            <label>Mr. Irving Anolik</label>
            <text syncTime="198.597" offset="868054">That is correct and we maintain that that has a substantial influence contrary to my illustrious colleague here, we maintain that as a substantial influence upon a sentencing Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.812" offset="912881">In their Brief they maintain that judges are never influenced by recommendations or lack of recommendations of the prosecutors.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="217.192" stopTime="221.558">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="217.192" offset="942451">This particular judge said that he was not influenced, did he not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="irving_anolik" startTime="221.558" stopTime="286.742">
            <label>Mr. Irving Anolik</label>
            <text syncTime="221.558" offset="959901">That is quite true Justice Stewart he said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.938" offset="973380">But we maintain that what he said and the consequences of what he did are quite incompatible.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.437" offset="1003369">We maintain that in White v. Gattney (ph) for example the Tenth Circuit case which is adverted to, that there too the judge, said he is not a listed influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.701" offset="1044433">Since my colleague here went dehors the record so to speak in saying judges are never influenced and incidentally, he is my successor as Chief of the Appeals Bureau on that office.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.209" offset="1086543">I think that I can ask this Court to take judicial notice of the fact that judges are frequently influenced by what prosecutor’s say.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.442" offset="1119457">So to say that it was diminished or that the judge merely by articulating that he was not influenced is of no solace because it begs the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.498" offset="1159685">The issue here is not whether the sentence was fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.330" offset="1170970">That is not the issue at all but that seems to be what the respondent is maintaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.370" offset="1191137">That the sentence was fair, it was the maximum permitted under law and perhaps it was fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.249" offset="1214647">But that is not the issue.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="286.742" offset="1220603">The issue is that when the prosecutor gives a promise of a quid pro quo for a plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.255" offset="1242650">It is Due Process requires that he keeps words.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.276" offset="1350797">Because the -- well, it conceivably could be the delivery of the promise except that now because of the notoriety which this case has achieved, we maintain that it would be of no use.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.607" offset="1496143">Justice Gelanoff if no articulation of a promise at all had taken place, quite possibly might have given the year sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="497.346" offset="2063104">The prosecutor in his Brief, the respondent’s Brief indicates that during the course of these proceedings and perhaps I should take one moment just to give you the chronology of what occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.232" offset="2118588">That the defendant here been indicted for two felonies involving gambling.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.611" offset="2144084">He had made a motion to suppress evidence returnable June 17th, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.205" offset="2178461">On June 16th, 1969, a day before the return day of that motion he interposed a plea of guilty to the misdemeanor before Justice Marks.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.064" offset="2237916">On the 17th the motion to suppress evidence was apparently adjourned without any disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.605" offset="2268113">A lawyer by the name of Fructman(ph) represented the defendant during these times.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.293" offset="2294863">Subsequently, I believe it was on September or October of 1969, a different lawyer by the name of Garanstein(ph) was retained by the petitioner here in.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.981" offset="2341570">And he then apparently tried to revive the crescent or dormant motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.998" offset="2369677">And in the course of doing that he indicated that this petitioner was unaware of certain rights which apparently was an incorrect statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.060" offset="2405935">Now, if there had been an issue of credibility as to whether or not a promise had been made or if there had not been a concession that the promise had been and broken then this factor would be significant in judging the credibility of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.051" offset="2469883">And we maintain that bringing this issue out is irrelevant completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.120" offset="2486183">Because it begs the question here namely that whether or not the credibility of the petitioner is good or bad after as to a collateral issue, the fact remains that by concession, this issue was crystallized namely if the promise was made and broken.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.060" offset="2549922">So to that extent will you just wish to distinguish that from the Brief of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.401" offset="2579284">We also maintain that in this case the District Attorney says, well this defendant has never indicated that he was innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.241" offset="2622647">Well, in our Brief of course we say that he is so maintaining but if we look at what he was trying to do and I think Mr. Justice Blackmun put his finger on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.385" offset="2659219">Here is the defendant who is asking that he be put back instead in status quo anti.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.437" offset="2683460">They would be permitted to withdraw this plea of guilty and go to trial under felonies.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.177" offset="2698402">Well, obviously if you were guilty and felt that he would certainly be convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.599" offset="2716061">I doubt that he would seek such a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.611" offset="2724107">So I think that certainly, circumstantially and inferentially he clearly indicates and has always indicated that he is innocent and I think that too is an irrelevant aspect of this case because the petitioner has made no doubt whatsoever as to what he is seeking here and no more and no less of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.959" offset="2821491">At the time of the sentencing, I might point out most respectfully to your Honors that the sentencing minutes begin at page 21 (a) of the joint appendix inadvertently, it seems that the printer calling it plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.801" offset="2892858">The sentence begins at 21 (a) of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.650" offset="2916263">Now, at the time of the sentencing here which incidentally came on before a different justice than the justice who accepted the plea of the guilty, Justice Marks as I had indicated accepted the plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.195" offset="2982405">He had retired at the end of 1969 and he then apparently was superseded in the capacity of sentencing judge anyway by Justice Gelanoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.173" offset="3038412">The District Attorney argues in his briefs and there is no basis in the record for this incidentally but he contends in his Brief that Santobello received the functional equivalency of his promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.723" offset="3096613">Now I frankly fail to follow that line of reasoning and I believe that it is a casuistic line of reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.612" offset="3128169">Because there was no functional equivalency here, he said that after all, the respondent says after all Justice Gelanoff said that he did not really pay any attention to the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.411" offset="3187310">Now, we have to bear in mind that the prosecutor here who was the executive assistant.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.814" offset="3212910">I think second or third in command of that office came in and made an impassioned plea for the maximum possible sentence under the law, adverting to merits clearly dehors the record conceiving in the record that he did not know what the probation report contained.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.030" offset="3285739">Linking this defendant with organized crime whether or not there is such a thing that probation report, I do not know because I have not seen it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Irving Anolik</label>
            <text syncTime="815.496" offset="3335685">Yes but at page 33, 34 and 35, I think you will find that Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.218" offset="3366510">And I think that that is very significant because after all we are not just dealing with a simple articulation of a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.295" offset="3398902">At page 38, the actual or the word arraign him for sentence appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.408" offset="3419277">So from 21 to 30 (a) are just preliminaries although it is a part of a sentencing minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.847" offset="3441011">But at 30 (a) begins the actual meet so to speak of the sentencing minutes, and I would point out that Mr. Chief Justice that Mr. Rodka begin at page 32 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="854.531" offset="3491793">And in the course of that as I say he brings in a number of things which were completely irrelevant and I think the fact that he adverts to organize crime, adverts the fact that this man had allegedly or not allegedly but had been previously convicted of a murder, which incidentally as I understand it from knowledge of the co-defendant in that same case, a fellow by the name of Joseph Corbo (ph), the United States Court of Appeals had declared that a confession in the Corbo case had been involuntarily obtained and it is my understanding that Santobello also reaped the benefit of that because although not for that he would still be in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.430" offset="3655424">He was apparently given time served and got out after 11 or 12 years of that sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.384" offset="3683219">So he had previously been the victim of a coerced confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.926" offset="3701400">It is true that a plea of guilty may not be an extra judicial confession but it is nonetheless an ultimate confession of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.237" offset="3734627">And when the prosecutor says that he was sophisticated, he maybe correct to the extent the he knew what could happen to him because he had been formerly victimized as the victim of a coerced confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.189" offset="3790425">But we maintain that the all too often function of a prosecutor, who perhaps sometimes is carried away by his zeal of bringing in completely irrelevant inflammatory and prejudicial matter to which the hapless defendant has no right to confront witnesses, cannot come forward and say what is the basis for these allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.918" offset="3893347">They are just articulated at the time of sentence which was done here and to say that a Judge can sit by in completely without being affected by that, I say is a mental gymnastic which no judge in the world or very few judges could possibly perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.625" offset="3964192">And just to paraphrase Judge Hand on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.948" offset="3981432">And we maintain that is a serious and important factor in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.071" offset="4005987">Now, in addition to the forgoing, the District Attorney in arguing further on his conception of functional equivalency states that we really should look into the issue of whether or not this man received a fair sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.689" offset="4092401">And with all due respect to the respondent I think that completely misses the point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.480" offset="4119568">We are dealing now with a concept of whether or not the representation of a District Attorney, a public prosecutor, whether or not it is malicious or innocent, if he makes a representation thus he have a right to break that representation if it in fact induced a plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.272" offset="4202742">Justice Gelanoff permitted no hearing on this issue although Mr. Aronstein said that a trial attorney who was present at that time was prepared to come forward and testify under oath that such a promise was made and we must bear in mind and I give the benefit of the doubt to executive assistant Rodka.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.417" offset="4283303">We must bear in mind that at that time Mr. Rodka made no inquiry of anyone as to whether a promise in fact was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.654" offset="4312247">He merely said that there is nothing in the plea minutes indicated was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.227" offset="4334608">Now, that frankly from an experienced prosecutor is a very amazing statement and perhaps this Court should be oriented to the extent of knowing what goes on at a plea bargaining session which perhaps you know far better than myself but at a plea bargaining session unfortunately there is a certain charade that is put on and I do not think that my colleague would can test this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.255" offset="4454667">Namely, that outside the presence of the sentencing judge the prosecutor and the defense counsel get together and perhaps ask each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.843" offset="4497090">Well, how can we resolve this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.351" offset="4507121">And I recognized that this Court has said that plea bargaining is perfectly proper and I am not condemning it but the point is that they decide that this case can be resolved by offering a plea of guilty to a misdemeanor which was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.632" offset="4572218">But no attorney worth his salt who is experienced in the criminal field and Mr. Aronstein at that time was a man of about 75 who had been practicing criminal law for many, many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.514" offset="4615685">No attorney worth his salt would accept a plea bargain without at least some conception as what the possible sentence might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.051" offset="4657899">Now, I might say that Justice Marks had a reputation of being fairly lenient sentencer, Justice Gelanoff has the contrary reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.225" offset="4706592">The representation was elicited from assistant District Attorney Greenfield that he would not in any way put the judge so to speak on a spot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.496" offset="4747656">That he would refrain from making any representation whatsoever or recommendation with respect to sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.022" offset="4773779">And in that context this was communicated to the petitioner and that is the reason that he pled guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.726" offset="4804603">Now, you may wonder why was it that this was not put on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.120" offset="4826128">For some reason it is almost never put on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.544" offset="4839816">I might point out also that in the elocution at the time of plea, now plea which is at pages 19 and 20 particularly of the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.875" offset="4897181">For some reason, and perhaps for a good reason, the judge Justice Marks did not ask the petitioner, was a promise made to you which is very unusual in New York plus that is almost always asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.509" offset="4951725">In this case it was not asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.077" offset="4965935">So, we may well infer that even the Judge perhaps was aware of the fact that a promise had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.437" offset="4999372">Now, if that were the case, of course it would merely exacerbate the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.370" offset="5015150">But it is quite contrary to usual practice, not to specifically inquire of a defendant who was taking a plea where any promises made to you or any threats made to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.735" offset="5060603">In this case, neither of those two questions were ever put to Santobello.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.972" offset="5081605">The ABA standards as I have adverted to already clearly indicate what responsibilities of the prosecutor are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.241" offset="5110654">Those ABA standards, the American Bar Association standards were clearly violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.161" offset="5134268">Again, I face into argue on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.264" offset="5146703">I am not alleging malicious violation because I have no reason for believing it is malicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.331" offset="5170944">Particularly in view of Mr. Sullivan’s very commendable admission that the promises were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.360" offset="5195081">But I do think the damage has been done and the only remedy of course, we would maintain would be the remedy of permitting a withdrawal of the plea of guilty and let me go to trial on the felonies and if he is convicted of the felonies and serves many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.407" offset="5251297">Well, that is his problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1485.237" offset="6014595">I fully recognize the problem that you are posing Mr. Chief Justice but it would appear to me that this would go to the very heart of the plea bargaining process, because in effect it would be establishing the precedent that a prosecutor could violate a promise and as long as the Sentencing Judge said, “well, it is truly violated the promise” but I am not influenced by it anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.876" offset="6105187">I am going to give him this maximum sentence anyway, and I think that that would go to the very gut of the plea bargaining process and render it a mockery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.999" offset="6137684">No defendant would feel safe in relying upon the promise of a prosecutor again, because of the fact that he would know that the prosecutor could deliberately violate it knowing that if he were lucky enough to put him before a tough judge and bear in mind in this situation, the prosecutor picks the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.041" offset="6213857">When the judge retires that the calendar procedure in New York county and I believe it is the same in Bronx county is that the judges are selected by the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.939" offset="6253459">They are not automatically picked out of a lot, as the cases in the southern district of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.797" offset="6272894">So it is quite something when a prosecutor can pick out a judge who he knows is tough and that is what happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.210" offset="6298494">So it is quite something to consider.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.806" offset="6324930">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.084" offset="6341961">I know of course that this tribunal will look at my briefs or statement of the legal position, I have taken because as yet I have not heard it articulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.971" offset="6381563">Alright, perhaps more importantly, I have not really heard much that resembles the factually the case of Santobello against New York and I propose (Inaudible) specific case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.356" offset="6439137">Now, to begin with counsel seemed to had some difficulty in focusing on just what the legal question is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.511" offset="6479679">We are not accused of trying to overreach as such in this case, the fact is this record will demonstrate that we do not have a prosecutorial misconduct case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.552" offset="6531924">There is no proof on this record of any bad faith on bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.564" offset="6547911">It has been disclosed to the Court that when time permitted and we became aware of it, well, we disclosed the true fact here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.854" offset="6581139">Now, the legal question that I do see here is one of reviewing the exercise of judicial discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.390" offset="6615202">In other words, the judge at the sentencing level being asked for permission to withdraw the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.705" offset="6640489">He acts decently in this situation finding out now, where he sentenced the petitioner that perhaps such a promise has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.401" offset="6679254">Now, I will come back hopefully to that in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.033" offset="6701824">There is more in this record than even the sentencing judge was aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.531" offset="6719796">Like, I am aware of the powers of this Court to review the record in this in entirely and I submit to your honors that if you look at this record, one thing will become crystal clear that this whole claim by the petitioner can be fairly rendered a sham.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.547" offset="6803911">The fact of the matter is that there was never a viable sentence agreement, we can analogize the contract law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.800" offset="6832854">In other words, Santobello just never put any stock in this representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.782" offset="6856783">You recall how it came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.570" offset="6867963">One assistant district attorney tells us before his counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.394" offset="6883219">The prosecutor would remain partisan at the time of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.348" offset="6899101">Petitioner is given a misdemeanor plea, go ahead into the future, a different assistant is in the bar and he asked for a maximum sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.893" offset="6937240">In this case, it was a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.164" offset="6950301">Now, in support of my claim and I say the record demonstrates, that this I think would fairly be called a sham claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.553" offset="6983842">I call the Court’s attention in several facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.358" offset="6999098">From Santobello's perspective, he himself reports with his prior murder conviction and all was no reign on in the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.683" offset="7040371">He knew certainly that judges control sentences and there was no a judge privy to any of the promises made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.310" offset="7078928">I have spoken already about the limited scope, then the nature of the promise itself I think has a relevance here when the man hopes that a prosecutor will remain partisan at the time of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.246" offset="7138696">He is not really opting for much in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.730" offset="7156564">It is more, I would suggest in expectancy or a hope really what one might call a promise and I have referred in my brief to several cases on that score.</text>

            <text syncTime="1850.486" offset="7475571">Well, then the problem there was in the review of the record whether we should make it in session or whether on balance, at least in our view, we felt that the man had not been overreached and thus proceeding, and so that that is on 34 (a) of the appellant's appendix. Now, while characterizing the petitioner here, I think I may fairly say on this record that he was engaged in Judge shopping here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.560" offset="7631888">You have heard reference made to Justice Marks being lenient in his sentences and that he had but one intendment to this petitioner, that says out of jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.889" offset="7677236">Alright, and I suggested to the Court that perhaps that is the same kind of thread running through this case right up until now despite the pro-rata respecting, having to face future charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.793" offset="7724884">Who knows what the future will bring? But I propose of what I am saying here that this was Judge shopping in effort to stay out of jail, you will find that the record indicates that Santobello’s first action in this case was to move to suppress the tangible evidence that had been found on its presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.259" offset="7822686">Now, it predates that several months until Justice Marks, who usually is in New York County, up into Bronx.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.929" offset="7865423">As it happens he takes the plea before Justice Marks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.618" offset="7880156">Now, he withdraws that motion, alright?</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.499" offset="7891650">We never have a point in this case again in which there is any claim of innocence which has a very important bearing under the Law of New York State because if a man made such a claim prior to the actual pronouncement of sentence or laws, is pretty much if you have to do something about it, you have to let him vacate or at least to have a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.841" offset="7985063">So now, I said that is an indication that he picked this judge, and looked like he was going along, alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.907" offset="8013276">The judge will order the probation report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.802" offset="8024874">Now wanting to adjourn date before Justice Marks with no preliminaries, no reported preliminaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.058" offset="8045876">Justice Marks gets up and says, in the record, one line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.550" offset="8059878">In view of the probation report I am putting in this case over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.217" offset="8074507">And I say that is an artilerry of things to come, that a Justice armed with a full probation report, now knows the background and Santobello knows the background.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.447" offset="8119437">In short, there is very little hope even before Justice Marks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.358" offset="8139081">So what happens?</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.202" offset="8142530">A week goes by, we have a change and the defense waives, incomes Santobello the petitioner would have battery emotions now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.872" offset="8181191">One of which is to withdraw the plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.778" offset="8192789">In it, among other things he squares in an affidavit, hey, you did not know, we had a right to move to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.656" offset="8224345">The fact being he already put in a small affidavit, abandon that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.589" offset="8243989">We submit to the Court as evidence, the conduct of this man to be taken as prima-facie evidence of perjury and more important in this context of the fact that what was happening here was Santobello, the petitioner was trying to dupe the Courts of New York State, and this case really is the other way around.</text>

            <text syncTime="2104.036" offset="8489854">Now, again now as I say, that sentencing over the case, that particular affidavit which is fairly susceptible of characterization as precarious and somehow disappeared from New York to files in New York Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.159" offset="8574281">Well, in any event now, we react to base, a suppression motion in conjunction with this effort to withdraw his plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.585" offset="8620048">Additionally as I say he does not trigger the New York law by making a claim of innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.570" offset="8651917">At that time, we offered him a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.227" offset="8666546">As it turned and particularly as we put in our own opposing phase, it was to challenge this assertion about how active knowledge of constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.202" offset="8698520">However, Judge Marks decided that we did not need that hearing and he puts the case over.</text>

            <text syncTime="2192.951" offset="8845432">He did Mr. Justice Stewart but we come again to this probation report which is before to the Court and I am going to suggest shortly, that really there is no alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.073" offset="8889945">I do not know if Santobello knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.489" offset="8899663">Now, the sentencing proceeding itself was marked by the effort by the Attorney Aronstein, that to stole again, keep this man out of jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.377" offset="8951176">And if you will find it, it is clear in the record, he starts involving some things about prior motions and about some comment of one he did not now, what had happened when he has been in the part and had been ruling -- I do not know, bogged down on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.335" offset="9015019">I think the fair characterization of this episode is that his last big stand was to stay out of jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.976" offset="9061622">Now, never was there a formal motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.495" offset="9075623">What happened was this, the man will sentenced Santobello, counsel Aronstein and then brought up the subject of this prior promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.235" offset="9118569">And that happened very quickly now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.850" offset="9129122">The prosecutor in the bar said something about it not being reflected in the minutes but the prosecution for the defense for that matter really did not get an opportunity to dwell on this subject to go into evidence because the judge took over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.636" offset="9204250">So there is no opportunity to do anymore even if we want to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.066" offset="9217939">And what the judge said in essence was a promise or not, I would not be affected because I have got an overriding probationary report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.051" offset="9265899">I would have no alternative when he was silent, you ask for the maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.167" offset="9282304">There is only one thing I can do, here is a quoted portion in the record of the probation report which is a plea to remove this man from the streets and this Court now has a full probation report and of course, would be better positioned to make an analysis of the propriety of that decision which as I see it is the question in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.026" offset="9365792">Usually this kind of thing comes up in the collateral post-conviction application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.463" offset="9383555">What is happened here of course is the sentencing judge was (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.996" offset="9401632">Now, there is a Tenth Circuit case that (Inaudible) referred to in which Kansas went along much the way I have been speaking in Tenth Circuit vacated judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.118" offset="9462131">On the reasoning that I have some difficulty coping with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.082" offset="9478014">However, Kansas approached that this is a matter of the exercise of the judicial discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.449" offset="9503509">The case involved however a license without over parole and while we will never know, the point is that the case was vacated and as the reason is not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.130" offset="9550216">They talk in terms of the effectiveness of the promise, I do not see really what difference that would make because, had we got ahead and remained partisan, he got no benefit from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.128" offset="9606223">Esthetically, then of course we would have gotten, well he opted for a bargain for and that is what I say essentially happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.780" offset="9636838">The judge is not privy to it, he is apprised of what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.864" offset="9653139">But the judge has positioned himself that there is nothing else he can do about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.110" offset="9670066">Your Honor I think the biggest difference between this case and White and all is there is no proof of reliance, whatsoever in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.588" offset="9707996">As I have said before that has been suggested here that in reliance upon this assertion, a promise to remain partisan that Santobello took the plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.001" offset="9753658">You would not find that record at all and if we were even to assume, this Court will exercise its powers over the facts that if Santobello recalled that hearing and I do not see that it would be necessary and we assume that he testified it and relied on it, well that is a fact or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.139" offset="9814262">You have enough record evidence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.207" offset="9822516">Taking a broader view of the record to reject that claim and in constitutional terms, in the narrower case if we reject that argument, I suggest to your honors that he did not in fact get what I call the functional equivalency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.852" offset="9885106">Certainly, the man has been promised something, we have to leave up, it would not be here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2779.125" offset="11190183">And we also question whether or not the prosecutor here, if he wanted to be fair, why did he not once found out of this come into Court as the American Bar Association of Standards 4.3 require and join an emotion to permit him to withdraw and indeed the fact is that a motion to suppress was made is given great import.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.955" offset="11277537">Under the New York Law, 813 (c) of the code of our procedure, a motion to suppress maybe made consistently with the plea of guilty, it survives the plea of guilty and in fact many times that is the way a motion of suppress is crystallized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.588" offset="11336051">So there is nothing inconsistent whatsoever with having made a motion of suppress.</text>
