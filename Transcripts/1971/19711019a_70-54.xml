            <text syncTime="7.084" offset="102047">If I can continue with my argument of yesterday, we submit that there must be a beginning and an ending to the loading and discharging process insofar as the obligation of a vessel's warranty of seaworthiness is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.740" offset="156590">This is necessary for the guidance of litigants as well as for the law of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.034" offset="185848">What started principally as the humanitarian policy by this Court in Sieracki to include those shore-based workers on a vessel, who were performing work, traditionally performed by seamen within the strict and rigid warranty of seaworthiness has now been taken onto the pier and extended to the shore-based worker who is operating exclusive shore-based equipment and as I stated yesterday, in recent case of McNeil has even been carried into the warehouse.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="72.043" offset="361808">A Federal District Court or Court of Appeals opinion?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_boyd_reeves" startTime="73.953" stopTime="393.848">
            <label>Mr. W. Boyd Reeves</label>
            <text syncTime="73.953" offset="369541">It was a District Court opinion sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.837" offset="385005">There must be a limit to the extent of the vessel's warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.869" offset="397126">We submit that the limits imposed by the District Court in this case are both realistic and reasonable, that is that loading of cargo insofar as the vessel's warranty is concerned, commences when the vessels tackle becomes a tax to the cargo and that unloading terminates when the cargo is landed on to dock or into a vehicle into which it is being discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.380" offset="499212">This has long been the test of liability as between a ship and shipper, often referred to tackle to tackle.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.245" offset="530664">Such a limitation does no offense to Sieracki or to Peterson or to the Gutierrez's case, because the dockside worker who is actually injured by the ship's own gear, equipment, cargo containers, arch crew, would still remain within the warranty.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.419" offset="603389">The Circuit Court below in this case held that the District Court's limitation of the warranty represented a minority view which defined the loading in an exceedingly narrow and mechanical fashion and chose to align itself with other cases, which define loading and unloading code in a realistic sense rather than hypothetical terms of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.134" offset="698266">In so holding, the Court of Appeals below has in effect completely disregarded the basis upon which the seaworthiness doctrine is premised, that is to afford protection to those individuals who are subjected to the rigorous discipline of the sea, going back to Mehnich v. Southern Steamship Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.639" offset="772244">Further, the Court below as we are argued yesterday, disregarded the extension of Admiralty Jurisdiction Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.006" offset="797740">We would invite the Court's attention to the opinion of Judge Watkins in a recent case from the District Court of Maryland which is Greene (ph) versus Pope &amp; Talbot, we have also cited in our supplemental brief, where after he gives a historical discussion of the seaworthiness doctrine, commence on this Bill Law case in Chagois versus Lykes Brothers and the Ninth Circuit case of Gilbert versus The Hawaiian Legislature and after saying what those cases hold, if I may quote, â€œthis liability without theory ignores the situs of the injury, ignores causation, ignores whether realistically the ship is being loaded or unloaded and ignores the true status of the injured party.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.929" offset="977358">Now, last term in the case of Usner v. Luckenbach Overseas Corporation, this Court held that it would be erroneous when no condition of unseaworthiness existed to hold the ship on a liable for third party single and wholly unforeseeable act of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.131" offset="1062203">We submit that similar logic and reasoning suggest to conclusion that a shipowner and his vessel should not be held liable for an accident which occurs solely on the dock as a result of exclusively shore-based defective equipment, which is being used for the purpose of moving or shifting cargo on the dock and over which the vessel has no control.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.904" offset="1161260">The justification for the imposition of the unseaworthiness doctrine with its rigid standard is absent under the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.447" offset="1207444">As I stated yesterday, unless the law under the facts of this case was not subject to the perils and hazards of a sea nor was his lift machine that he was operating in appurtenance of this vessel, we are not suggesting a reversal of Gutierrez case because there there was actual vessel involvement in that dockside injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.688" offset="1304411">We do urge that a limitation be placed on the extension of the seaworthiness warranty by limiting the principles which are set forth in Gutierrez to those instances where the vessel itself, its own gears, own equipment, has caused the shore-side injury, rather than shore-based equipment over which the vessel has absolutely no control.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.220" offset="1394586">Before I sit down I would like to say I understand that probably it was Friday, the American Trial Lawyers Association has filed the motion for an amicus curiae brief in this case, I have not seen it, I am not in a position to make any response to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.974" offset="1449547">I do not know what the Court's action would be on it, but we would respectfully submit that the Fifth Circuit has gone beyond the holdings of this Court in extending the warranty of seaworthiness out on to the dock to this shore based equipment that if limitations and guidelines are not placed, we believe that the hypothetical situations which the Court expressed in Gutierrez which the court below says, we do not reach this particular type of situation, however, it does leave the door open by saying we will reach that case when it comes before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.811" offset="1616940">I respectfully submit that for the reasons it was stated the First Circuit has erred and suggest and request that be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="445.602" offset="1856117">Bill Law was a member of the ILA, International Longshoreman's Association, local 1410.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.878" offset="1889240">He was a member of the gang of Willy Kaiser and he was selected in the Makeup Gang early that morning in front of Union Hall on Davis Avenue in Mobile to load this particular hatch of this particular vessel, the S.S. Sagamore Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.149" offset="1954233">When he got to the dock, he was assigned by his foreman Willy Kaiser to operate the forklift machine on the dock, taking the landing mats from its storage pile from the open pier, some 50 feet from the cargo hook and delivering it to the cargo hook from where it was taken onto the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.947" offset="2033436">They were subsequently loaded to the vessel by other longshoreman has been used and I think it could be misleading, it was a continuous operation, the landing mats were sent out on targets and it was thus taken on to ship.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.815" offset="2224966">The ship's officers always maintain supervision and control of the vessel in the loading and unloading operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.974" offset="2253596">Customarily, it is my understanding that they do not interfere with the stevedoring contractor's control unless they see something that is wrong in the manner of storage or something wrong, it is in the manner of the loading or discharging.</text>

            <text syncTime="581.840" offset="2401031">This case was heard on a motion for summary judgment, only the deposition of Bill Law was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.616" offset="2432169">The fact that I would like to mention is that the Bill Lawâ€™s fellow workers had worked this vessel the day before, had loaded landing mats into the hold of this particular hatch, in the wings of this hold, and had worked to the hatch square.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.041" offset="2501864">The forklift that was used in the hold of the ship, the day before for taking the landing mats into the wings of the ship, was not necessary when they were landing in the square of the hatch and that morning it was taken out of the hatch onto the dock and it is the machine that Bill Law was using.</text>
