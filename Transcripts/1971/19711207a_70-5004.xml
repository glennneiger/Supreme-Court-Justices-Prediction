            <text syncTime="39.157" offset="230253">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.217" offset="254494">This is a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.620" offset="288140">And I represent the petitioner Donald Yogurt Humphrey who presented as the Court knows his hand written petition to this Court without the benefit of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.547" offset="359820">Mr. Humphrey’s case, commenced -- started back in May of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.291" offset="394824">On May 30 of 1967, he was arrested in the state of Wisconsin Waukesha County which is a county adjacent to Milwaukee County and charged with the offense of contributing to the delinquency of a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.971" offset="461593">This is a misdemeanor in the State of Wisconsin caring a maximum penalty of one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.479" offset="495552">We do not have the record, Your Honor of that initial proceeding here.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.787" offset="520839">However, in his petition to this Court for writ of certiorari Mr. Humphrey said, he was sitting in a car and drinking beer with the boy who was almost 14 years, he was 13 at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.181" offset="566396">And this is--, I think over in Wisconsin, a very frequent type of case that contributing to the delinquency of a minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.223" offset="602550">It is against the law for a minor to drink beer and if an adult gives him an alcoholic beverage, you are then contributing to delinquency of a minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.353" offset="643092">So that is apparently the offense for which he was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.735" offset="660646">May 30, 1967, the next day, May 31, 1967 he was in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.148" offset="686246">He pleaded guilty to the offense and the Court under the Wisconsin Sex Crimes Act committed him for a pre-sentence examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="181.701" offset="800454">Well, Your Honor, I will explain what the Wisconsin Sex Crimes Act covers.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.112" offset="818112">In Wisconsin under our Sex Crimes Act, there are two categories of Sex Crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.983" offset="849564">One category is that which calls for a mandatory sentence under the Sex Crimes Act and that includes the offenses of rape, attempted rape, sexual intercourse without consent and indecent liberties with a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.667" offset="920303">If you are convicted of those, you automatically go in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.688" offset="936395">However, the Wisconsin statute provides that any other offense except homicide or attempted homicide can also be a Sex Crime, it is a Sex Crime, if the Court finds that the defendant was probably, directly motivated by a desire for sexual excitement in the commission of the crime, if the Court finds --</text>

            <text syncTime="257.548" offset="1103892">If the Court finds that the defendant was probably, directly motivated by a desire for sexual excitement in the commission of the crime, this becomes a Sex Crime in the State of Wisconsin.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.379" offset="1179229">It does not require assuring on that issue and we do not have a record as to what happened but we do have a record.</text>

            <text syncTime="321.581" offset="1359996">He also says the boy was sent to a hospital for a Medical Examination and that there was no evidence of any Sexual Molestation.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.890" offset="1393224">So it is unfortunately, that we do not have that record but that is what the evidence is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.641" offset="1420287">We do have the Court's order of commitment which does not indicate any hearing on that particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.507" offset="1451738">He was sent away on May 31st and on July 24th, the report came back from the Department that had examined him and that is found the orders in the Court -- entered an order which is found on the appendix on page 11, that is part of the record and the Court says nothing about the basis of its finding that this was a Sex Crime, it says that he was sent away and the report of the Department came in and based upon that report he sentences him under the Wisconsin Sex Crimes Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.078" offset="1598024">He was sent to walk on state prison which at that time was the facility designated for a Sex Crimes Act people.</text>

            <text syncTime="981.111" offset="3998155">I believe that that is an administrative function by the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.248" offset="4054684">I think, I had gotten in my chronology to the point where the Department had asked to extend him for five years and it came up for a hearing and he was then represented by Mrs. Naft who was appointed by the Court representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.702" offset="4108496">I think being indigent at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.553" offset="4119885">Mrs. Naft advised him that he should not cooperate with Court appointed psychiatrists who were present in Court on the day of the hearing and said she intended to raise the constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.746" offset="4184669">The Court ask for her to file brief sentence and that was agreed a brief in schedule were set up and then apparently nothing further was heard from Mrs. Naft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.130" offset="4226151">The Court record indicates that the judge wrote a letter to her and said if we do not hear from you we are going to conform this order and then the next happened is, in November the order was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.307" offset="4270873">November 20, 1968, Judge Björk who was the substitute judge signed an order, confirming the extension for five years and in his order which is found in the appendix on page 14, he recites the fact he had expected to get briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.328" offset="4354987">And he says the matter having been adjourned for the purpose of filing briefs to support their respective positions to the state in the defendant and no briefs having been filed and the Court having directed correspondents to Mrs. Naft dated October 15, 1968, advising Mrs. Naft Smith that the absence of the filing of briefs and any affirmative acts for and on behalf of the defendant with regard to this matter, the Court would presume that the defendant did not intent to offer any proof as to its condition and the order would stand and accordingly, he confirmed the orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.482" offset="4495631">So here you have a man represented by an attorney who did not do anything at the hearing, no cross examine, they were no witnesses presented as to the state position and then she set on, I am going to argue this on a constitutional basis and she did not file any brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.280" offset="4554772">So it is our position that-that type of representation is equal to nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1459.740" offset="5912617">And that the Wisconsin’s Supreme Court has so interpreted that statute as to be in conflict with this Court's decision with the Baxstrom case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.993" offset="5945636">In the Baxstrom case which was the case in New York where you had a person who had been sentenced on an assault charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.709" offset="5992551">A man was sentenced I think it is about two and-a-half years and toward the end of his sentence, they filed a petition saying this man is insane.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.287" offset="6026824">It requires his mental treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.640" offset="6036228">So then there was a proceeding and he was committed to an effect a criminal type facility for treatment and it came to this Court and this Court compared that treatment that he got with what a person under a civil commitment was entitled to in the State of New York and said that the statute was unconstitutional because that person should have been entitled to his same treatment a person civilly committed guy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.757" offset="6148659">Now, I think that is very applicable to the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.535" offset="6163810">Here we have a person who our man, he get sentenced on a crime contributing to the delinquency of a child and then at the end of one year which is the maximum for which he can be sentenced, he is again committed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1799.943" offset="7273492">Perhaps it should be well to begin by dealing with some of the questions that we are put to Mr. Charne.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.475" offset="7319572">The question on the section as far as discretionary commitment is concerned is dealt within Section 97502, which provides that if their sex crime is defined there is one in which the desire for the sexual excitement existed in the commission of the crime and provides that the Court may take testimony after conviction if necessary, to determine that issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1858.353" offset="7507131">Let me clarify that Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.107" offset="7526148">The way the charge is booked is Section 94715, Subsection 1, Subsection 80 which is contributing to the delinquency of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.647" offset="7580274">The Sex Crimes Act then comes in to play Your Honor, just as or the closest analogy would be the habitual criminal statutes which we have in Wisconsin Section 939.62 where the enhanced punishment as a repeater comes into operation not as an additional charge but as an enhancement of punishment but there is a separate finding and the defendant is given notice before he pleads to the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.841" offset="7745054">And of course, this is our contention precisely that -- I have got a stand here and I cannot say anything outside the records but it is an inference I believe, Your Honor, from the Heubner case and the other cases as I cite in my brief such as Rippon (ph) that the practice was when this defendant entered his plea of guilty then he was informed that he might be subjected to the disposition under the Sex Crimes Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.689" offset="7912447">Now, the purpose for the discretionary element on these crimes other than the three mandatory ones is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.245" offset="7954661">If you charge a man with incest why is necessary to take additional testimony, on that to show that sexual excitement existed in the Commission of the Crime.</text>
