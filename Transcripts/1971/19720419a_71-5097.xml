            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73729">-- first this morning in number 71-5097, Huffman against Boersen.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.309" offset="118869">Mr. Eisenstatt, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="leo_eisenstatt" startTime="16.567" stopTime="603.893">
            <label>Mr. Leo Eisenstatt</label>
            <text syncTime="16.567" offset="139976">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.928" offset="165367">This case is on petition for writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court of the State of Nebraska and involves in its essence a -- several questions involving the annulment of a marriage, a determination of paternity and the allowance or granting or the violation thereof the right to be present at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.520" offset="283753">These proceedings now before the Court commenced by the filing of a petition for annulment in the District Court of Hall County, Nebraska, Grand Island approximately in the middle of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.366" offset="339133">The defendant in that case, petitioner here Harold Eugene Hoffman was at that time incarcerated in the state penitentiary in Lincoln, Nebraska approximately a 110 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.945" offset="397438">Throughout the proceedings, Mr. Huffman appeared pro se until the appointment of counsel by this Court in response to his request for a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.453" offset="455535">The essential facts, as we view them, would be that on March 5, 1969, these two parties, Harold Eugene Hoffman and Faye Boersen were married in Las Vegas, Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.666" offset="556367">At that time, the parties had been living in Hamilton County, adjoining Hall County in a small town known as Giltner, Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.287" offset="606836">At that time, there was -- there had been filed by Faye, a petition for divorce from a marriage contracted according to the record with Richard A. Boersen and with respect to whom there were two children at that time of the marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.608" offset="708087">Now the, and I will get into the facts in a little more detail, the petitioner's view of the issues in this case are in two general areas, and that is, was the equal protection of the laws violated with respect to the petitioner by reason of the dismissal of his appeal in that annulment case by the Nebraska Supreme Court because he failed to file a $75 cost security, bond or cash in lieu thereof, and secondly, were his rights to be present at the trial violated when he was incarcerated at the state penitentiary at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.831" offset="900975">The facts are not in dispute and although there are lengthy pleadings on file, a distillation of those facts in our opinion could not make the facts very complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.398" offset="959280">Now, before referring to these additional facts, I would like to footnote Nebraska provisions dealing with the matter of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.682" offset="1000449">Since its founding, the State of Nebraska has had in its Bill of Rights, a provision, guaranteeing right of appeal in all civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.853" offset="1033050">Article 1 Section 24, provides the right to be heard in all civil cases in the court of last resort by appeal, error or otherwise shall not be denied, and as announced by a long line of Nebraska cases, more particularly as it applies to this case and we've cited in our brief, the case of Ferber versus Leise which held that this right of appeal exists irrespective of the merits or the lack thereof in the court or in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.967" offset="1161572">In other words, they take the position that our Supreme Court should not consider a case until it's been properly presented and not try to anticipate whether or not the appeal is frivolous or has some substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.003" offset="1233670">Now the records shows that Faye had been married to or entered into a marriage ceremony with Richard Boersen in June of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.211" offset="1282571">And she had filed an action for divorce, well, there were two of them, but the one involved is in February of 1969 and that action Boersen had filed a counter suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.522" offset="1343802">Then on March 5, as I stated, she married the petitioner in Las Vegas, Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.269" offset="1378702">And about a-month-and-a-half later, April 24, a divorce decree was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.511" offset="1395734">In October of that year, 1969, she gave birth to a child, a child which the petitioner claims paternity and is also one of the issues involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.002" offset="1461667">Now, in November 1970, Faye filed the petition for annulment in the Hall County district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.620" offset="1496149">Huffman was incarcerated in the state penitentiary on November 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.748" offset="1520704">The sheriff of Lancaster County pursuant to our local procedure served the summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.725" offset="1540557">He was allowed in to serve the summons on the petitioner and service in written was made of that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.790" offset="1584860">In the pleadings that followed as I said all filed by Huffman pro se, by the way Mr. Huffman is the inmate's legal assistant at the Nebraska penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.427" offset="1631358">A review of the record in this case would indicate some expertise and knowledge on his part that might not be possessed of an ordinary layman.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.550" offset="1675871">Now, among the pleadings filed, he raised the issue of denial of her right to annulment.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.902" offset="1713278">He raised the issue and claimed the right to be found -- the father of his child born in October 1969 and he also demanded in several pleadings the right to be present at any trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.355" offset="1783078">He also advised the court that he was without funds and had no counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.685" offset="1816410">Now, the record is undisputed that about that time, Mr. Huffman had approximately a $114 of resources and this has been stipulated and admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.737" offset="1884642">The case as I said was filed in November, in March of 1971 Faye's attorney ex parte asked the court to set the case for trial, which was perfectly in line with local procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.166" offset="1950366">The case was set for trial on March 26. Huffman was given notice of that trial, again by the sheriff of Lancaster County, who served this upon him on March, 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.360" offset="2015149">On that same day, Mr. Huffman wrote a letter to the judge, which appears in the Appendix at Page 48, stating that he had just received this service which was four days prior to the trial, that he had no counsel, and again, renewed his demand to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.495" offset="2099682">Now, in a prior document, which he filed, called a motion for appearance, he had advised the court of the same facts and further advised the court that all it took was a simple order by the court to have the warden produce Mr. Huffman at his trial on the annulment in Grand Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.067" offset="2177945">On March 26, the trial took place and a decree or order of annulment was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.100" offset="2210127">Huffman's pleadings were all dismissed, held for naught.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.352" offset="2231130">On April 9, Huffman filed his notice of appeal and this is all in accordance with Nebraska procedure and he paid a $20 docket fee which is also required by our statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.664" offset="2284315">He also filed praecipes for the preparation of a transcript, preparation of a bill of exceptions, which were prepared; the transcript by the clerk, the bill of exceptions by the court reporter and these all appear in the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.714" offset="2376580">Now Section 25, 1914 of our Nebraska statutes among other things requires that the cost security of $75 be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.529" offset="2427780">Now our Nebraska statutes have, I think, as most states do requirements which must be followed in order to lodge an appeal in the Nebraska Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.139" offset="2474278">The notice of appeal and the $20 docket fee are denominated as jurisdictional.</text>

            <text syncTime="654.589" offset="2692034">On May 19, Faye's attorney filed a motion in the Supreme Court of Nebraska to dismiss the appeal for failure to file the cost security.</text>

            <text syncTime="1043.577" offset="4247992">Now the rule involved in this case and for which petitioner seeks redress at this Court stems mainly from the rule in Boddie versus Connecticut, decided by this Court in March of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.468" offset="4327509">The Court in Boddie, this Court in Boddie was careful to announce that it was deciding the case only on the basis of the fact that it was a marital situation, allowance of an indigent to file a divorce petition, and because the state exercised control over it, the marital relationship in its dissolution, it held that this case then merited the application of the rule that had long been in effect with respect to criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.034" offset="4461778">Now on that basis alone, we have a similarity here in our Huffman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.623" offset="4488214">We have an annulment and a matter of determination of paternity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.381" offset="4511202">The issue, of course, goes one step further and that is the matter of appeal and it is petitioner's opinion that the rule of Griffin versus Illinois, decided in 1956, is applicable here and also the cases which have followed Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.616" offset="4584136">Griffin held that an indigent in a criminal case was entitled to have a transcript furnished by the state, if he could not afford it in order to provide him with an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.593" offset="4636067">As the court pointed out, appeal is not required, but if the state allows appeals as a general practice and in its rules and procedures, then it cannot as a matter of equal protection of the law deny the same rights to indigents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.230" offset="4698552">And there have been a host of cases following Griffin in the criminal field and the rule has been amplified, for example, in Williams versus Oklahoma City decided in 1969 by this Court, extended the Griffin rule to a quasi-criminal case which was a violation of the city ordinance, 90-day jail sentence and a small fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.455" offset="4799489">It also involved the issue of free transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.223" offset="4810565">And then in December of this year, in Mayor versus Chicago, this Court extended the Griffin rule to a misdemeanor case which involved a fine only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.663" offset="4856331">And based upon Boddie, which extended the right of access to the courts in a marital situation, we feel mandates, the application of Griffin and its progeny to this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1919.992" offset="7753625">First of all, the statute involved as I read it does permit discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.570" offset="7788002">Page 5 of respondent's brief quotes this statute and it says that the appeal maybe dismissed on motion and notice in the Supreme Court that no bond has been given and certified in the transcript or within such additional time as maybe fixed by the Supreme Court for good cause shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.528" offset="7887789">So that even the failure to file this bond or undertaking and it can be cash, would not necessarily be an automatic dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.014" offset="7937736">So there is discretion here, but I am assuming as is Mr. Eisenstatt that they did dismiss this simply because the money was not posted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1997.403" offset="8063332">I would like to address myself to a question Mr. Justice Douglas raised with reference to whether or not the Boddie case was raised in the Nebraska Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.389" offset="8107218">My colleague Mr. Belcher argued that motion for dismissal in the Nebraska Supreme Court, and I was informed and it was our point that the Boddie case is distinguishable herein because the purpose of this bond statute and urged to the benefit of a private litigant and not to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.551" offset="8191855">Now there was no written opinion issued by the Nebraska Supreme Court when they dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.120" offset="8210140">I don't know but that basically was the only argument that was made because Mr. Huffman did raise that case very well in his objections to our motion to dismiss.</text>
