            <text syncTime="36.808" offset="220971">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.909" offset="241347">I'm W. O. Shultz, an Assistant Attorney General from the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.287" offset="254826">I'm representing the Board of Regents in this case this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.331" offset="274992">Initially since this Court postponed jurisdiction until argument I address myself briefly to this jurisdictional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.282" offset="322849">The only objection which appellee raises in his brief to the jurisdiction of the Court is -- concerned itself with the fact that there is a coordinating board in the State of Texas and the appellant contends that is a higher authority that has statewide jurisdiction and the Board of Regents is somehow under yet with regard to its rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.394" offset="407276">I submit to the Court that this is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.513" offset="419711">The Act creating the Coordinating Board and makes it precisely that, a coordinating board.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.966" offset="445520">Its primary purposes are to coordinate the degree programs through the institutions in the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.535" offset="479792">Our higher education set up several of the colleges, have their own Board of Regents.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.215" offset="506542">The University of Texas of course has a systemwide campus setup.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.072" offset="534023">We have a -- campuses in El Paso, Arlington, Dallas, Odessa, Midland, Houston, Galveston, Port Aransas, San Antonio.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.869" offset="585118">These are all under the direction of the Board of Regents.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.387" offset="599224">And the primary purpose of the Coordinating Board is to coordinate degree programs in all the colleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.256" offset="626705">And then before a college can institute a new degree program, they must get approval to the Coordinating Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.711" offset="652514">The Act creating the Board specifically says that it shall have only such powers as are given to it in the Board, I mean in the Act in any power which one of the governing boards of an institution of higher education has that are not specifically delegated to the Coordinating Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.365" offset="723149">The Coordinating Board does not have and there's no provision in the Coordinating Board Act which gives them the authority to promulgate rules and regulations which are applicable to any other campuses with regard to the day-to-day operation of those campuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.757" offset="788769">At the last session of the legislature, there was a codification of -- of the various Education Acts, they were put into an education code.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.406" offset="835267">Well, this Coordinating Board Act was incorporated in the Education Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.774" offset="856792">At the same time, same session of the legislature, there was an act passed applying specifically to the Board of Regents of the University of Texas System, it's Art. 2585e, Vernon's Civil Statute and just recently been codified as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.455" offset="931502">Section 1 of that Act reaffirms the powers of the Board of Regents to promulgate rules and regulations applicable systemwide and may -- may I quote -- if I may quote briefly, it says authority -- the Board has authority “to promulgate and enforce such other rules and regulations for the operation, control and management of the University of Texas System, and the component institutions thereof as the Board of Regents of the University of Texas System may deem either necessary or desirable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="247.431" offset="1063368">Section 5 of that Act says, and I quote, “This Act is cumulative of all statutes relating to the University of Texas System or any of the component institutions of the University of Texas System, except where -- where such statute may be in conflict with this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.978" offset="1137556">If any such conflict arises, the conflicting statute is hereof by repeal to the extent of that conflict.”</text>
            <text syncTime="274.234" offset="1170679">So here, we have, I think all doubt removed as to any primary authority in the Coordinating Board as to its regulatory power, veto power of the rules and regulations of the Board of Regents.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.073" offset="1225954">Now, on the Texas law, our Texas Supreme Court has held that the regulations and rules of the Board of Regents of University of Texas are the equivalent of statutory enactments, they are laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.862" offset="1281125">I think that since these regulations are systemwide and cover a substantial area of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.177" offset="2542421">But here, we -- we've got a board with control over 17 institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.816" offset="2580978">In the University of Texas in Austin alone, they have 40,000 students and over 7000 employees on a 265-acre campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.927" offset="2629356">And when you include all the other campuses and institutions on part which say how many people involved but many, many thousands and they're placed under this regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.661" offset="2680347">And they have the undoubted force and effect of a statute according to the pronouncement of the Texas Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.556" offset="2719949">And that is our basis for the jurisdiction of this Court from a direct appeal from a three-judge federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.000" offset="2761745">Now, if I may address myself to how this case came about, it was born out of an effort of the Board of Regents to enforce its solicitation rule on the campus at the University of Texas at Austin against a group known as the New Left Education Group and a -- a number of individuals that were selling on the campus a newspaper known as Rag not in conformity with the rules applicable to the sale of newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.448" offset="2923495">The Regents after local administration at the campus after repeated efforts and warning to these people and to stop, as the Attorney General's office to institute a civil injunction proceeding in the state District Court, Travis County to enforce their rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.828" offset="3008968">We filed this injunction suit, and shortly thereafter, the selfsame defendants in the state court action went to the United States District Court and filed an action there asking that the rules be declared unconstitutional, that the Regents be enjoined from enforcing them and that the prosecution of this civil injunctive suit and the state court be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.384" offset="3139267">We pointed out to the court by pleaded that 2283 in our explanation, an injunction statute, prohibited this very action in the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.712" offset="3204573">Mainly thereafter, the pleadings of the plaintiffs in the United States District Court were amended to bring in Young Democrats and seven or eight individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.495" offset="3267685">Now, reading that pleading as a whole in the motion, I think it's undoubted, they all claim to be members of a common class of people who claim that their constitutional rights are being infringed by the enforcement of this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.625" offset="3328184">Now, the group of individuals, I don't think ever presented a case or controversy for the court to act upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.099" offset="3354098">They merely said in the pleading that we are interested in the free flow and dissemination of information on the campus of the university.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.721" offset="3392550">There was never any evidence produced or any stipulation or any affidavits filed by them that showed in any manner how these rules had been enforced against them or how they had prohibited them from obtaining any specific article, printed matter or hearing any speech that they desired to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.449" offset="3475515">There simply was no factual basis in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.155" offset="3490352">There was never any adduced to show that they presented any justiciable controversy with regard to these rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.484" offset="3515639">So consequently, they stand largely ignored throughout this entire proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.577" offset="3548031">Shortly after, the Young Democrats intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.176" offset="3566421">They didn't beg upon, they didn't intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.786" offset="3572795">They came in by way of the first amended complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.715" offset="3592543">They ask for the same relief that the original parties, plaintiff asked for with the exception they didn't ask that the state court proceeding be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.425" offset="3643430">Shortly after this, by a motion to intervene a group known as the Young Socialist Alliance were allowed into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.286" offset="3678852">They adopted the prior pleadings as their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.999" offset="3697660">Now, it's our position that all of these parties at this point in the proceeding pled themselves to be members of the common class of people on the university or campus at Austin who desired to solicit in violation of the Regent solicitation rules and that their acts under the First Amendment were being infringed and asked for the same relief, everyone of them, that rule be declared invalid and it be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.340" offset="3835064">The next event that occurred was a hearing before the United States District Court three-judge panel at which the arguments were made concerning 2283 and that court then entered what I consider to be a rather strange order.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.248" offset="3910715">It divided this class of plaintiffs in the United States District Court into two groups and denominated them as class A and class B.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.732" offset="3960661">It never did say that they had distinct and individual claims or causes of action that their actions were definitely just dividing them into two groups within the class, class A and class B.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.689" offset="4000472">And it says, “Class A, you're the people that are defendants over in the state court action.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.955" offset="4025549">Now, we're going to dismiss you to go back over to the state court, we're going to dismiss you almost.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.317" offset="4054911">Said we're going to retain jurisdiction, in the event they do something to United States Court that can't be condoned, then you can come back here and ask for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.177" offset="4086362">We'll retain jurisdiction to that extent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.263" offset="4106738">So with things in that posture, we proceeded to the state court and obtained temporary after a full hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.856" offset="4145085">And the record reveals that in the state court, these parties defendant, there were parties plaintiff in the federal court, pled and raised the same constitutional objections that they were pleading in the federal court, if you please, violated First Amendment right, protection under Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.885" offset="4241216">These were argued to the state District Court after a full hearing on temporary injunction, witnesses testify, counsel for all parties in the federal and state court proceeding were the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.221" offset="4318538">The state District Court then entered a temporary injunction, specifically finding that the rules were constitutional and temporarily enjoining the defendants and all others acting in concert with them from soliciting by means of the newspaper known as Rag on the University of Texas campus at Austin, other than in conformity with the solicitation rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2861.290" offset="11518826">The suit was filed, that's correct, by the, what was called the New Left Education Project in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.372" offset="11543172">Thereafter, as the record reflects, the Regents changed their rules again and caught up the Young Democrats and the rules and said the first time that they couldn't -- not solicit membership dues at registration time which had been a traditional right of theirs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2886.214" offset="11618509">The Regents opposed urging among other things that there should be severance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.801" offset="11640870">This was all argued at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.993" offset="11649647">The court issued its order supporting the Regents with respective to a three-judge court, severing out the initial plaintiffs, the New Left plaintiffs and sending them back to the state court and saying if they would -- can take and keep, retain the action as to the Young Democrats for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.473" offset="11715580">Three months later, the Young Socialists filed a motion to intervene and were permitted intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.999" offset="11745673">If I -- I mean it was in that posture of the case came on for a final decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.638" offset="11772214">The arguments with respect to class, with respect to res judicata, I -- are -- are murky but I -- at best, I -- the Texas class action rule is the old federal rule that is they had dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.125" offset="11838147">It was in a high (Inaudible) from the federal rules, no notion of this furious class, and it was not binding as a matter of res judicata unlike the new federal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.132" offset="11874196">The -- although the grant of a temporary injunction is appealable, it's only reversal on a clear abuse of discretion that's governing Texas standards so I don't think there's finality in the Texas state court judgment that would sustain res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.731" offset="11948592">And finally, these parties albeit having similar interest whenever in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.631" offset="11976178">They were told in fact by the federal courts that they were free to remain there and litigate their issues, and this, they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.783" offset="12000837">And I see -- I think, but for the birth of the case and perhaps that's -- I -- I take full responsibility for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.369" offset="12027169">I guess they're just a matter of judicial economy or economy in the office or something.</text>

            <text syncTime="3000.097" offset="12074085">And so, rather than do another one and have another three-judge court appointed, we did it this way.</text>
