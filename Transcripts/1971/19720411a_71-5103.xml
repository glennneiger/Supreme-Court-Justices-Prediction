            <text syncTime="51.785" offset="280829">I was appointed by this Court to represent petitioners in this case which is a -- which are habeas corpus cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.114" offset="306115">I was likewise appointed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to represent petitioners in the -- in the cases below.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.701" offset="336522">The opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit which is under review in this case affirmed the orders of Judge Stephenson, at that time, United States District Judge for -- for the Southern District of Iowa, denying both the petitions involved in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.423" offset="399320">Petitioners had both been prisoners in the Iowa State Penitentiary and had both been and -- had both received paroles from the Iowa Board of Parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.357" offset="439131">Subsequently, each of their respective paroles were revoked by the Iowa Board of Parole such revocations having been accomplished without either of the petitioners having been afforded any type of evidentiary hearing to establish the fact of parole violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.954" offset="501511">Both petitioners alleged in their petitions for habeas corpus filed in the District Court that their constitutional rights to due process of law had been violated by the action of the Iowa Board of Parole in revoking their paroles without a hearing, and that such state action constitute -- constituted a deprivation of liberty without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.912" offset="589283">Judge Stephenson in separate orders denied their respective petitions holding that the applicable -- Iowa statutory law did not require such a hearing and that the procedures followed by the Iowa Board of Parole had been held sufficient for federal constitutional purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.107" offset="650096">After granting the certificates of probable cause, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit heard the cases en banc and by a vote of 4-to-3 affirmed the order -- orders of Judge Stephenson.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.937" offset="697430">This Court granted a certiorari on December of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.308" offset="714879">The question then presented for review in this case is whether or not the action of the Iowa Board of Parole in revoking petitioners' respective paroles without providing either of said petitioners a prior evidentiary hearing to establish the fact of parole violation, denied petitioners' liberty without due process of law in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.488" offset="819578">At this point, I believe, a brief factual review of the circumstances is appropriate.With respect to petitioner Morrissey first, he entered a plea of guilty to a county -- county attorney's information charging him with false uttering of a check and was sentenced by an Iowa State District Court to the Iowa State Penitentiary for a term of seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.389" offset="907245">After serving approximately one and a half years of his sentence, Morrissey was granted a parole by the Iowa Board of Parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.298" offset="938906">After being on parole approximately seven months, he was arrested for a parole violation, confined in the county jail and shortly thereafter, his parole agent filed a written report of violation with the Iowa Board of Parole recommending that his parole be revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.728" offset="1004630">Three days later, an order was entered by the Iowa Board of Parole revoking his parole and ordering that he be returned to the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.403" offset="1035245">This order was entered by the Iowa Board of Parole solely on the basis of the parole officer's written report without granting the petitioner a hearing of any kind to determine the fact of parole violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="291.468" offset="1239523">However, it is our position that he did not unequivocably admit the alleged violations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1099.359" offset="4471079">And these cases I'm talking about are cases like Goldberg versus Kelly, Bell versus Burson, Groppi versus Leslie and Greene versus McElroy.</text>
