            <text syncTime="753.343" offset="3088392">In January 1971, Sister Egan who is a Catholic Nun and the other respondent, Ms. Walsh is not, was subpoenaed to appear before a Grand Jury sitting in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania investigating various alleged violations of the criminal code.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.121" offset="3159549">This is the same Grand Jury that returned the indictment in the Barragan case, the first indictment in that case was returned two days before and Sister Egan was named as an un-indicted co-conspirator.</text>

            <text syncTime="795.647" offset="3257665">And following this, she was first given more limited so called used immunity and then the day after when it became apparent to the Government that she would continue to assert her privilege under the Firth Amendment, she was given the full transactional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.012" offset="3315135">She was then called before the Grand Jury and refused to answer any questions other than giving her name and her address.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.958" offset="3346899">She was asked and refused to answer approximately 70 or 80 other questions and following her refusal, the District Court held her in civil contempt and ordered her committed until she purged the content.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.082" offset="3407399">She gave six different grounds for refusing to answer the questions and the pertinent one set forth at page 54 of the record here, which this is the provision relating to the alleged illegal wiretaps, it’s number four in the top of page 54.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.649" offset="3481691">She said, “The evidence on the basis of which I have been named as a non-indicted co-conspirator, subpoenaed to testify and answer questions was secured by illegal wiretaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.908" offset="3522651">In addition, all or some of the telephone communications monitored by the United States government, involved communications within the Roman Catholic Church of America and specifically, between my provincial headquarters and the offices of the church in New York, Rome and throughout the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="880.757" offset="3598093">The second witness, Ms. Walsh was called before the Grand Jury in April of 1971 three months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.925" offset="3630798">She was intentionally given full transactional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.515" offset="3649084">She refused to answer all the questions put to her before the Grand Jury and the same thing happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="909.220" offset="3711987">All members of the court, all five Judges agreed that the 1968 Act gave a witness before a Grand Jury the right to challenge the evidence, which led the Grand Jury to call the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.986" offset="3767053">In addition, two of the Judges also believed that the Fourth Amendment gave the witnesses this right.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.031" offset="3799236">The Government’s arguments in this case are substantially the same as those, which was made in the last case both on under the Fourth Amendment and under the statue.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.659" offset="3837688">And I would therefore like to turn briefly to the argument that I was making when the Court -- of the argument on the previous case was terminated and that is the applicability of Section 3504 to this claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.139" offset="3907592">3504 is set forth in our brief in the Egan case at page 33 and I had previously indicated that what it did was to limit the total amount of hearings that would be required in cases of electronic surveillance occurring prior to 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.167" offset="4003722">We have that cut off date.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.869" offset="4010514">And then it goes on and say, if there’s any hearing before a Grand Jury upon a claim by a party of aggrieved, that evidence is inadmissible because it is the primary product of an unlawful act defined as electronic surveillance or the exploitation of such act.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.523" offset="4073104">The opponent of the claim shall affirm or deny the occurrence of the alleged unlawful act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.839" offset="4098390">Now, although this refers to the making of such a claim at a proceeding before a Grand Jury, the claim to be entertained must be made by a party aggrieved and in discussing this Section, the legislative history speaks of someone who makes a claim, speaks of a claim by a defendant, it uses the word by a defendant withstanding to challenge the unfair practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.922" offset="4214792">A defendant is ordinarily not viewed as someone who is a witness before a Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.741" offset="4242064">And furthermore, standing comes again to the question I have previously discussed as to whether or not, whether or not a mere witness before a Grand Jury has standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.692" offset="4285845">And it seems to us would be most anomalous we think that the Congress, which in this statute in 1970 was attempting to reduce the volume of litigation growing out of claims of illegal electronic surveillance, would at the same time have given to Grand Jury witnesses a right to challenge evidence before a Grand Jury that they didn’t have under the 1968 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.547" offset="4389290">We think that the whole basic purpose of this statute was to reduce the amount of litigation relating to surveillances taking place before June 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.953" offset="4442893">And indeed, the legislative history indicates that Senator McClellan stated that this Section was limited to surveillance that occurred prior to June 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.850" offset="4498482">And of course, we deny surveillance, but if there was any surveillance in the case, it would appear that it would took place before that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.148" offset="4531605">Now, I would like to now turn to another argument in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1178.610" offset="4789486">Now, the argument is made by the respondents in this case and by position adopted by some of the Judges of the Court of Appeals that it would violate Section 2510, if the Government used this evidence before the Grand Jury, that is they say 2510 prohibits the use of any evidence before the Grand Jury if the evidence is obtained in violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.340" offset="4920411">And therefore, the argument is that the District Court should not lend its authority in effect to permit or force the prosecutor to violate the statute and commit a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.764" offset="4974119">I think this argument fails to take adequate account of the precise language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.147" offset="5007660">The statute says, not that the recede in evidence of any intercepted communication that is prohibited if it violates the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.692" offset="5057815">What it says is it’s prohibited if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of this chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.130" offset="5087595">That is the prohibition is the use before a Grand Jury or a court of any evidence if the disclosure of that would violate this chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.158" offset="5131690">That’s in Section 2515 at page 60 of the Egan brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.685" offset="5149766">Now, I’ve shifted to the Egan, of the respondent's Egan’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.843" offset="5166485">So therefore, we must look to other Sections of the statute to ascertain what disclosure is prohibited and the prohibitions on disclosure are contained in 2511, which begins at page 53 of the Egan’s brief and the critical sections or subsections C and D on page 54 and they prohibit willful disclosure or willful use of any intercepted communication knowing or having reason to know that the information was obtained through the interception in violation of this subsection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.836" offset="5314442">That is disclosure is only illegal it seems to us if in fact the person using it knew or had reason to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.065" offset="5351327">Now, in this case, assuming arguendo was an interception here, there's another provision of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.078" offset="5387376">Subsection 3 at pages 55 to 56 which was before this Court several months ago in the Keith (ph) case which is US against United States District Court at Subsection 3, at pages 55 to 56 which says nothing in this chapter shall limit the constitutional power of the precedence, about halfway down to first full paragraph on page 6, to take such measures as he deems necessary to protect the United States against the overthrow of the Government by force or violence or other unlawful means or against any clear and present danger to the structure or existence of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.448" offset="5540872">And it goes on and says the contents of any communication intercepted by authority of the President and the exercise of the foregoing powers maybe received in evidence in any trials here and the other proceeding only when such interception was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.749" offset="5598028">Our position is that as long as it has not been definitively determined that the interception without a warrant in national security cases is illegal and the court of course will decide that in the Keith (ph) case at least as long as that is the situation, the prosecutor could not be charged with knowing or having reason to know that any evidence obtained as a result of an allegedly illegal interception of anyone’s telephone conversation in this field, that the disclosure of that would be in violation because the prosecutor as far as he was concerned had every reason to believe that at least at that point, it was permissible to conduct any such electronic surveillance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.412" offset="6508761">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.312" offset="6524330">Let me say a word or two about the question that’s come up with regard to the procedural posture that this case is in now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.218" offset="6555886">The position that the Government took in the trial court was that they would refuse to affirm or deny the existence of the surveillance not because they didn’t know, but because the witness had no such right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.737" offset="6618057">And indeed in the Court of Appeals, Government counsel was asked by Chief Judge Hasty, “Do you want to take a position on that or words to that effect” and the Government counsel as I recall responded, “No, our position is that it's irrelevant because the witness doesn’t have the right to raise the issue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.227" offset="6696006">There was no denial in this case until the Government filed its petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.768" offset="6718158">In any allegations with regard to the existence or non-existence of surveillance in this case is outside of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.184" offset="6759850">I might also say in that regard that in as much as the Government refuses to affirm or deny surveillance in the District Court, they also refuse to say whether or not a court order or a national security tap was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.702" offset="6825887">So that to the extent that the Government argues that it may not be a violation of the criminal section of the statute, if there is such a specification, their representation I would submit is likewise irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.436" offset="6884819">In the posture that this case was decided in the District Court and on appeal, the Government refused to say anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.735" offset="6913972">And on that basis, the court assumed that there may have been surveillance and that more important decided that the witness had a right to raise the issue and had the right to get a reply from the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.909" offset="6966739">Now, if we read the Government’s brief in the Egan case, and indeed in the early portion of Government’s counsel argument, there is an awful lot of discussion of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.626" offset="7017522">And I think it's most important to analyze why it is that the Government relies so heavily upon what they call the exclusionary rule and past cases dealing with the use of testimony in subsequent proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.294" offset="7088261">Their argument and their use of the exclusionary rule is based upon a critical premise which we submit is false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.109" offset="7123474">And that premise is that Sister Egan in the trial court sought to invoke the exclusionary remedy in order to remedy a past and prior violation of her statutory rights independent of what was happening in the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.883" offset="7202573">And I would submit to this court that that premise is false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.330" offset="7216366">And that really what we were involved with here is a question of whether or not it violates the law to compel within the Grand Jury room both statute and constitutional, within the Grand Jury room divulgence and disclosure of illegally ascertained conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.507" offset="7289091">And when the court asked the question, “Well, what’s the harm to the witness if the evidence isn’t being used against him or her,” the answer is that the harm to the witness comes from the divulgence and the disclosure, which is prohibited by the statute and as you look at Section 20 --</text>

            <text syncTime="1858.591" offset="7509459">Questions as to the purport and meaning of the conversation, what was said and questions of that kind and I would suggest to the Court in that context that the statutory definition of the contents of a communication includes not only the actual words spoken, but the purport and content of the message.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.644" offset="7597649">And so as we look at 2511 C and D, we find that not only has the actual interception been deemed an invasion of rights of privacy, but the use and the disclosure as well had been made a statutory crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.875" offset="7662537">And in addition to 2511 C and D, we have 2515 which has already been referred to in the previous arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.746" offset="7694093">2515 is an absolute prohibition against the use or introduction in a Grand Jury of evidence obtained in violation of any provision of the chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.439" offset="7744771">And I might mention in that context Your Honors that 2517, Subsection 3 specifically says that there can be no testimony in a Grand Jury as to illegally -- as to electronic surveillance evidence unless that evidence was obtained by means authorized by the chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.121" offset="7835572">So not only do we have the criminal sanction in 2515, we have another separate section which talks about use of evidence in a Grand Jury on the condition that it's obtained by means authorized under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.230" offset="7899938">Now, the Government has suggested that notwithstanding the broad language of 2515 and the existence of the criminal sections and so on, that there are some limitation imposed by the motion to suppress section which is 2518 Subsection 10 A.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.713" offset="7969946">The first requirement of 2518 (10) (a) is that Sister Egan being aggrieved person and an aggrieved person is statutorily defined as a person whose own conversations were intercepted, whose own wire or all communication were overheard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.560" offset="8045283">There is no requirement that such a person be a defendant in a criminal proceeding and indeed, Congress expressly rejected that condition in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.650" offset="8093662">In 1967, Senator McClellan introduced the bill into the Senate, which defined aggrieved party as a defendant in a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.970" offset="8138906">Now that bill wasn’t passed and in 1968, Senator Hruska introduced a subsequent bill which changed that language and defined aggrieved person as a party to a communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.113" offset="8195539">And the legislative history isn't cited in the brief, but a section by section comparison of these two provisions can be found in the Congressional record at Volume 114, Part 10, 90th Congress 2nd Session, Page 13211.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.998" offset="8271086">Now, in addition to the aggrieved party terminology in the -- aggrieved person terminology in the section, which Sister Egan clearly is, there can be no doubt that a Grand Jury inquiry constitutes a proceeding as that word is used in a statute and indeed Hale versus Henkel which was mentioned earlier by Mr. Justice Douglas is most opposite in that regard as our cases like Capaldi (ph) versus the United States or other cases, which arise in the context of contempt hearings held to adjudicate issues that arise in the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.819" offset="8426357">And in addition to the meaning of the word proceeding, there can be no doubt that a proceeding on an order compelling testimony initiated by the Government is also a proceeding before a court under authority of the United States which is the language in 2518 (10) (a) and in an application on a Government -- a hearing on a Government application for a contempt would likewise be covered by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.386" offset="8540565">And indeed, judge Gibbons' dissent in the Egan case in the Third Circuit concedes this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.341" offset="8572434">It concedes that notwithstanding any issue as to whether or not a Grand Jury is covered certainly in a contempt application or hearing in an order to compel testimony would be covered by the statute and I believe he refers to that as a non-issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.611" offset="8641502">Now, the Government draws -- tries to draw support from the omission of the term Grand Jury in 2518 (10) (a) and it parallels that omission with the omission of legislative committees and it says that those two omissions indicate an intent on the part of Congress not to make the 2515 remedy available to witnesses before such bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.948" offset="8762815">Now, to reference the omission to legislative committees is really very interesting because the analysis, let me step back for a second.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.249" offset="8800013">As we’ve analyzed 2518 (10) (a), we’ve drawn a distinction between the situation of an actual witness as opposed to someone who isn’t subpoenaed, and therefore, not in the Grand Jury or not brought before the court, a distinction between parties and non-parties and there’s a very curious sense in the legislative history of 2518 (10) (a) from which we draw support for our position on the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.730" offset="8917982">The sense and I believe it may have been referred to by Government counsel in explaining the omission of legislative committees says, “Nor was this provision intended to grant to the Federal Courts' jurisdiction over the Congress itself.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.171" offset="8987781">And the case cited is Hearst versus Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.698" offset="9001887">Now, I’ll come to Hearst versus Black in a sense, but there's something very curious about the sense from the legislative history that I just spoke off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.425" offset="9036787">Not only does it appear to contradict the inclusion of legislative committees in 2515, it also appears to conflict with the line of cases in this Court, most notably, Watkins versus the United States, which do hold that the Federal Courts do have the power and indeed the duty to review the propriety of congressional action if and when a legislative witness is brought to a contempt proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.266" offset="9144098">And then we turn to Hearst versus Black which is cited in the Government’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.964" offset="9162906">Hearst versus Black was a case in which a Senate subcommittees subpoenaed telegraph records from the telegraph company and not from Hearst.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.855" offset="9202508">Presumably, those records related to Hearst and he saw it to intervene to prevent the committees’ use of those documents in its proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.806" offset="9242318">And what the court said was that in as much as Mr. Hearst hadn’t been subpoenaed, wasn’t before the committee, hadn’t been ordered to testify, he couldn’t intervene and simply stopped the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.169" offset="9299788">And most significant, the case went on to say that if Hearst had been before the committee as a subpoenaed witness, he would have the right to litigate the lawfulness of the committee's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.717" offset="9349943">And that’s precisely what we’re talking about in our analysis of 2518 (10) (a) when we say there's a world of difference and it's not too hard to ascertain and answer to the question that Mr. Justice White I think asked earlier between someone who subpoenaed, and therefore, before the court to compel testimony or any contempt hearing and someone who isn’t subpoenaed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.621" offset="9441580">There’s a difference between Sister Egan whose called in and compelled to divulge and disclose her own conversations as opposed to a third party agent or somebody else who comes in and testifies without her knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.610" offset="9509499">Now, she may not be able to notwithstanding the fact that it would be still be a crime if the agent did it, she may not be able to stop that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.331" offset="9540428">And such a holding would be consistent with cases like Hearst and Blue versus United States which I will come to in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.849" offset="9582433">There's a very important distinction between someone who is subpoenaed and is compelled to testify and someone whose own rights of privacy may have been invaded, but not by the actions of the prosecutor or the Grand Jury or the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.133" offset="9647634">Now, the subject or 18 U.S.C. 3504 has come up and I think that that Section is absolutely crucial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.293" offset="9676264">The Government has said that what could be more anomalous than Congress using in 3504 widening the rights that hadn’t been made available in Title III which was passed in 1968 because the Government’s position is that Title III didn’t give the witness any rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.583" offset="9757348">Well, I suggest to the court that it would’ve been very anomalous if 3504 had changed Title III and that in fact it did didn’t change Title III and that moreover, the inclusion of Grand Juries in 3504 was an express adoption of the provisions of Title III which had been enacted two years earlier and moreover in that context, the Government’s position that since a witness isn’t a party as such to a Grand Jury proceeding, he or she doesn’t have any rights to object to surveillance, that position makes the plain language of 3504 nonsensible because not only does 3504 include the term Grand Jury, it also talks about aggrieved parties and clearly, what that Section would envision (Voice Overlap).</text>

            <text syncTime="2951.287" offset="11880163">And I would suggest to this Court that that’s an unacceptable interpretation both of the statute and apart from the statute, under the supervisory power of this Court.</text>
