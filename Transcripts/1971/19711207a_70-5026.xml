            <label>Mr. Charles Stephen Ralston</label>
            <text syncTime="12.813" offset="124933">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.946" offset="141442">To briefly recapitulate, we have urged with regard to issue two in this case that the total exclusion of women where it is the direct result of procedures used by jury commissioners as shown by this record resulting in the total exclusion of more than one-half of the population of a community results in a jury system that in the words of this Court in Carter contravenes the very idea of the jury that is a body truly representative of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.247" offset="286683">Now, the reasons why a jury system which excludes women or such a system is not representative had been set out by this Court in its decision in Ballard versus United States which we quote in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.710" offset="360557">And basically by excluding this group, an identifiable group, it excludes from the jury system a whole range of attitudes and perceptions that can be brought to bear in any criminal case and so excuse the system drastically away from its proper function, that is, its function to as a democratic institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.813" offset="480930">Again, as this Court said in Ballard by such an exclusion there is injury to the jury system to the laws of institution to community at large and of the democratic ideals reflected in the processes of our Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.269" offset="550729">A problem of what Lafayette Parish has done pursuant to Louisiana law and the problem with Louisiana statute itself is that it rests on assumptions about the function of women in our society which this Court has recently characterized in Reed versus Reed as arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.208" offset="638500">That is assumptions about the proper role of women, the notion of women will automatically have such responsibilities at home that they cannot serve on jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.526" offset="683744">We contend that a State must devoid this kind of an assumption, this kind of a procedure that results in an unrepresentative jury system and essentially treat women on the same basis as men are treated, that is to focus in on specific and well defined concerns that may allow an exemption, such as occupational exemptions or more narrow exemptions for women who have special family duties that would make it a hardship for them to serve.</text>

            <text syncTime="190.357" offset="835150">I might just point out as an illustration, Florida after the Hoyt decision, amended its statute allowing women who were pregnant or who had children, I believe under the age of 16 to exercise the personal exemption if they so wished.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.873" offset="893142">The problem with --</text>

            <text syncTime="214.337" offset="931072">They are and the Louisiana statute, there are personal exemptions to be exercised by the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.095" offset="958030">The statute specifically says that they are not basis for challenge or cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.838" offset="977047">As a matter of fact what Lafayette Parish did was not send questionnaires to even these exempted categories, although under the statute it seems that they should have and allow those individuals to exercise their own exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.184" offset="1026366">Which you think, it would violate the constitution if physicians for example were excluded in the same category as women, that is they were all excluded unless they ask to serve?</text>

            <text syncTime="255.635" offset="1096270">Your Honor, I think it would be preferable to have again an exemption that they could exercise at least on their wish.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="260.257" stopTime="264.614">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="260.257" offset="1114660">Well, we are only talking about what is constitutional here, are we not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_stephen_ralston" startTime="264.614" stopTime="288.230">
            <label>Mr. Charles Stephen Ralston</label>
            <text syncTime="264.614" offset="1132110">I would say that that kind of an exclusion would focus in on a narrow class of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.868" offset="1161158">It would not result in a wholesale exclusion of a large group and thus focus in on what I think could be said to be a legitimate interest, that is they can -- given the importance of decision and having sufficient numbers and positions available.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="288.230" stopTime="289.828">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="288.230" offset="1226569">Otherwise you find a rational basis?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_stephen_ralston" startTime="289.828" stopTime="525.634">
            <label>Mr. Charles Stephen Ralston</label>
            <text syncTime="289.828" offset="1232943">There would be a rational basis for that kind of a limited exclusion of a group and again the effect on jury system would not be particularly extreme in terms of the portion, numbers of people to be excluded and there are other possible groups, that same kind of exclusion could be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.876" offset="1325207">There maybe a problem at some point if there is so many groups excluded that you do result in a system that is unrepresentative.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.929" offset="1353420">But narrow exemptions or exclusions would, I think be proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.318" offset="1382990">Now, finally on this point, I just want to bring out that, we feel that any person faced with a criminal procedure has the right to object to the exclusion, this kind of a wholesale exclusion of a whole group even though in this case the defendant was a male, that the right to a jury system that fairly represents a community in light of the proper function of the jury to interpose between the accused and the State, the voice of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.768" offset="1532724">This right extends to all persons and not simply to persons of the excluded class.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.388" offset="1563235">And I would just cite to the Court, two State cases that have taken this position, the case of Maryland versus Mattison 213 Atlantic 2nd 880, and Allen versus State of Georgia, 137 Southeast 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.935" offset="1637423">711.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.830" offset="1649021">I would just like to touch for a moment on the third issue involved in this case, that is the use of the statement taken from the defendant by interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.722" offset="1696564">We have pointed out in our brief the issue with regard to this question is the effect of the Harris case and briefly, we would like to urge that the Harris case is distinguishable on, really on two basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.054" offset="1753929">The first as you pointed out in our brief is the question of the reliability of the statement, whether or not the defendant actually said what he has claimed that he said and there are two points on this, number one, he denies, that is what he said and there is a conflict in the testimony of two of the police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.757" offset="1828744">One said that he insisted, a number of times he did not commit the rape and the other police officer said, he did not say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.768" offset="1860717">In these kinds of questions of reliability, we feel the statement, Harris should not be excluded to that kind of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.345" offset="1895095">The other basis of distinction is the fact that in Harris it was admitted that the confession did not comply with Miranda and the jury was specifically instructed that it could be considered only for purpose of impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.216" offset="1954549">In this case, the trial judge held that the confession was taken in compliance with Miranda and that therefore presumably the use for all purposes and an examination of the record does not reveal that the judge instructed the jury that the confession could only be used for the limited purpose of impeaching the defendant’s testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.715" offset="2052561">There is no so statement in his overall charge of the jury and there is no such statement at the time the confession was brought up.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.719" offset="2084535">The District Attorney did say at one point that he was going to impeach the defendant’s testimony, but the judge never instructed the juries to its limited use without such an instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.278" offset="2130824">It is simply cannot be assumed that the jury may not have considered the confession as in terms of the proving of the actual fact of the commission of the crime.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="525.634" offset="2176172">Was there a request for a limiting instruction?</text>

            <text syncTime="527.998" offset="2185681">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.546" offset="2187875">That does not appear in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.762" offset="2192682">Again the judge has held that it did not violate Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.452" offset="2211490">So it maybe that everybody was going on the presumption that it could be used for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.822" offset="2236985">But since it did not comply with Miranda, we feel this is kind of error that so permeates the whole system that the Court can hold the use of it unconstitutional even without a request for limiting instructions under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.281" offset="2314830">I will reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.118" offset="2322144">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="637.019" offset="2621717">Very good.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.131" offset="2638226">If Your Honors, please, I would like to start off with the first point and there are three points involved here, the first one being that they are all complaining that there was a systematic exclusion of Negroes on the grand jury, the second being systematic exclusion of women and the third of being the failure to comply with Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.312" offset="2750971">So I would like to begin with the first point and say this that I came here today not to defend the commission or the clerk at Court who was a member, but to praise him in the manner in which he selected names to be considered for the grand jury as well as the petit jury, but I would like to point out to the Court that the complaint here is strictly to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.978" offset="2909586">He is not complaining that there was a -- that the trial was not fair or that there was anything wrong with the petit jury, but simply to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.206" offset="2958487">The clerk of Court began, as he said to attempt to get as wide the range of persons as he could to consider for a grand jury and petit jury service and I would like to point out that he sent out 11,000 questionnaires in a parish, a county we call it parish here in Louisiana, but where there was 40,000 population, he sent out 11,000 questionnaires according to his testimony which is in the record here and incidentally the record was compiled by the complainants and we are going to court on the record that they have got, they have complied and submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.308" offset="3178961">But there were 11,000 questionnaires mailed out, out of the total of 40,000 persons in the parish of which there were 21,000 males.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.412" offset="3231310">He sent out this only to the male population.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.083" offset="3246043">Although, we did have a place to show whether they were male or female because the clerk did attempt and it is shown in the record that the clerk did attempt to get women interested in jury service.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.866" offset="3305184">As the record will show that he talked to my assistant who happens to be a lady, an Assistant District Attorney there and trying to get her to talk to the women’s clubs and get them interested in that and the reason, he said in the records, they had not done it before was because we had an old courthouse which has no facilities to help to -- for women jurors, but that was going to -- were being built at the time a new courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.155" offset="3418347">And at the time that the case was tried we tried it in the new courthouse, but at the time that the selection was made we were in the temporary courthouse at that particular time, but he did try to get the Assistant District Attorney to get the ladies interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.021" offset="3481772">Now, to go over this there were 21,000 males in the parish and there were 17,000 white and about 4,000 Negroes which amounted to 20% Negro and so far as the male population was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.528" offset="3563797">Then he has the registered voters here, we will show it that there were a total of 6,541 Negroes who were registered out of the total population of 9,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.076" offset="3625968">So there are -- the entire -- the population of this parish is very highly registered both white and Negro because out of the 9,400 Negroes in the parish there were 6,500 registered voters and there were 3,573 Negro males in the parish and 17,000 white males in the parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.696" offset="3748430">Now, he sent out 11,000 of these questionnaires and he went around looking as everywhere to try to get list from different people.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.277" offset="3786778">He used every eighth person who was registered and erased the border and that was -- there were 40,000 voters of which there 30 to 4,000 white and 6,500 Negro.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.561" offset="3847904">Now you have to consider that there were -- that is a parish that has very few Negroes, comparatively speaking, only 20% or 21% Negro there.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.843" offset="3885103">So they used every eighth person registered.</text>

            <text syncTime="2086.072" offset="8417975">And I would like to draw to my last point Your Honor which is the question of whether or not the accused rights were prejudice insofar as the constitution is concerned in the Miranda versus Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.068" offset="8497909">Now, understanding this particular case, Your Honor, insofar as the Miranda was concerned we did not use the statement in convicting the accused and presenting our side of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.931" offset="8537406">We did not use it at all and we had no intention because we were able to prove and that I think is an unusual case where they caught the accused in the act of committing the rape which is a very unusual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.506" offset="8615669">So it was not necessary to use the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.349" offset="8631029">So we did not use it, did not mention it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.421" offset="8651405">But we did serve on the accused and his lawyer before the trial started without the jury knowing about it, we served a notice that we would introduce the confession, you see, because that is the law of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.463" offset="8699575">If you intend to use a confession you have to give a notice ahead of time so which we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.322" offset="8714935">But when we presented our side of the case we did not use the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.102" offset="8738131">And at the end of that our presentation of the case, when the defense or when they had to prove their side they came on and they have put him on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.428" offset="8779405">So as soon as they have got through with their examination of chief then I asked the Court to withdraw the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.355" offset="8819111">And after the jury was withdrawn and I advised the Court that we have a confession which we intended to use to impeach the testimony of the accused and so while they were out, we then proceeded to show the voluntary nature, under the law of the State we have to show the voluntary nature of the confession, which we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.852" offset="8913047">We showed the voluntary nature of the confession as well as the compliance with Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.185" offset="8930393">Now, their complaint is that Miranda was complied with all except for one thing, they said that the accused were not told that he was entitled to an attorney at the time that the statement was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.303" offset="8982846">So that was what we -- we did inform him, he was informed, he was informed by the officer or which one, was it called officer, he was informed of all of the rights in the Miranda but we did not inform him Your Honor that he was entitled to an attorney at that time when he gave the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.472" offset="9063617">So that is what their complaint is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.253" offset="9070722">So but the judge thought that he did complied with Miranda because they said he was told you are entitled to an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.668" offset="9108339">So he said that -- he indicated that he thought that when he said you are entitled to an attorney the guy should have understood at that time, but he did not say at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.001" offset="9145642">He did not use the word at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.548" offset="9155882">So then that is their complaint, but I am saying this that the statement was voluntary, was shown to be voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.977" offset="9185557">The Court found it was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.603" offset="9192140">It was proven to be voluntary outside the presence of a jury then again in the presence of a jury, we showed it was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.751" offset="9216695">We did prove it, it was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.513" offset="9223695">It was reliable and there was no coercion of any kind there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.275" offset="9242817">As a matter of fact he was drinking coffee, asked the fellow if he would like to have some coffee, he said no, I do not want to drink coffee, offered him, I think some cigarettes and some phone call or anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.457" offset="9279493">But it was a friendly place to -- attitude in that park but --</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.934" offset="9869442">And the point I wanted to make is you can compile racial statistics without having the racial statistic from the racial information on the documents that are actually used by the jury commission.</text>
