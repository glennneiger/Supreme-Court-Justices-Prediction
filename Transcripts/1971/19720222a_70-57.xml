            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="59.493" offset="312375">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.554" offset="324601">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to review a decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.739" offset="361381">The question raised relates to the obligation of a newspaperman to appear before a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.292" offset="395549">The court below held that he need not even appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.254" offset="415402">We think that decision was wrong, and that it goes far beyond anything that can be found in the words of the First Amendment, and beyond anything that can fairly or properly be implied from that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.614" offset="484888">The case arises in this setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.340" offset="503801">In November 1969, David Hilliard, the Chief of Staff of the Black Panther Party, stated publicly in a speech, “We will kill Richard Nixon.”</text>
            <text syncTime="124.229" offset="571301">This speech was televised live, and rebroadcast over many stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.964" offset="606305">As a result Hilliard was indicted in December 1969, charged with making threats against the life of the President of the United States contrary to Section 871 of Title 18 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.594" offset="676731">The threat was repeated in three subsequent issues of the weekly periodical called 'The Black Panther.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.365" offset="707869">' Numerous public statements of a similar nature were reported as being made during the same period by members or friends of the Black Panther Party in various parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.577" offset="772757">The respondent in this case, Mr. Caldwell, is a newspaper man, employed by the New York Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.585" offset="808702">He wrote a series of articles about the Black Panther Party, three of which appear in the printed record.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.956" offset="846214">One of these was published in the New York Times on December 14, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.532" offset="876516">It appears in full at pages 11 to 16, of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.935" offset="910161">In this article, the respondent reported on a conversation he had with Hilliard and others at the Panther's Headquarters in Berkeley California.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.477" offset="956346">He quoted Hilliard as making the following statement, and this appears on page 13 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.885" offset="1005979">“We are special,” Mr. Hilliard said recently, “We advocate the very direct overthrow of the Government by way of force and violence, by picking up guns and moving against it because we recognize it as being oppressive and in recognizing that we know that the only solution to it is armed struggle.”</text>
            <text syncTime="260.716" offset="1117260">And then Mr. Caldwell went to say in the article, "In their role as the vanguard in a revolutionary struggle, the Panthers have picked up guns.”</text>
            <text syncTime="273.500" offset="1168356">Some weeks after the publication of this article, the first subpoena was issued to Mr. Caldwell, on January 30, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.418" offset="1216108">This was a subpoena duces tecum.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.636" offset="1228960">It appears on page 20 of the Appendix, but it was not pressed and it is now involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.887" offset="1269920">The second subpoena was issued on March 15, 1970, it appears on page 21 of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.915" offset="1310044">It is a subpoena to testify only.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.066" offset="1326658">Most of the proceedings in the District Court were taken with respect to it, but the grand jury to which that subpoena was returnable, expired early in May, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.086" offset="1394785">A new grand jury was in empaneled and a new subpoena, the third subpoena was served on May 22, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.121" offset="1430834">It's that subpoena which is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.034" offset="1446508">The decision of the District Court related to it, but by order of the District Court, the proceedings relating to the earlier subpoena were incorporated into these proceedings, and therefore, we refer to one or the other interchangeably.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.145" offset="1530935">A motion was filed to quash the May 22, subpoena, it appears on pages 98, 99 of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.552" offset="1580568">It states, the grounds of this motion are identical to the grounds of (Inaudible) motion to quash grand jury subpoenas filed March 17, 1970, and it was with respect to the earlier motion to quash that Mr. Amsterdam stated, and this is on page 36 of the Appendix, right in the middle of the page, the essential claim of the motion to quash is that Mr. Caldwell's very appearance before the grand jury under the broad terms of these subpoenas will irreparably breached and damage associations and means of freedom of speech and of the press, protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.914" offset="1798011">The District Court, Judge Zirpoli in the Northern District of California, denied the motion to quash and directed the respondent to appear, but subject to very specific conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.347" offset="1863840">The District Court's order of April 7 which was where he made the determination, appears at pages 94–97 of the Appendix, and the corresponding order of June 4 appears at pages 104 and 105 of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.204" offset="1951193">The relevant portion of the order actually involved is on page 105 and it reads as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.842" offset="1989750">It is hereby ordered that Earl Caldwell is directed to appear before the grand jury pursuant to the subpoena of May 22, 1970 and in so doing, he shall not be required to reveal confidential associations, sources, or information received, developed, or maintained by him as a professional journalist in the course of his efforts to gather news for dissemination to the public through the press or other news media.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.479" offset="2144290">Two, that specifically without limiting paragraph one, Mr. Caldwell shall not be required to answer questions, concerning statements made to him, or information given to him by members of the Black Panther Party, unless such statements or information were given to him for public information, for publication or public disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.906" offset="2250034">And third, that to assure the effectuation of this order Mr. Caldwell shall be permitted to consult with his counsel at anytime he wishes during the course of his appearance before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.309" offset="2319624">Thus, the issue here is an exceedingly narrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.359" offset="2347836">The respondent has been granted protection against revealing confidential sources and confidential statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.544" offset="2384617">The government did not appeal from that part of Judge Zirpoli's order and this was partly because we did not think that it was appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.132" offset="2426935">It is clear, however, that these limitations are in no way at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.049" offset="2458596">The only issue here is that expressed in Mr. Amsterdam's words, in the show cause hearing before Judge Zirpoli, when he said and this appears on page 108 of the Appendix in the transcript of the hearing before Judge Zirpoli just below the middle of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.821" offset="2557652">The only cause which we have to show is that Mr. Caldwell has a constitutional right not to appear before the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.717" offset="2617316">” The Court of Appeals below sustained this contention in it's entirety and held that the respondent need not even appear before the grand jury and despite the broad protection which has been afforded to him by the District Court's order.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="655.226" offset="2695265">In a way, is it despite or is it in view of the broad protection that's been applied to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.819" offset="2729642">Now since he has been given so much protection and since that's not been appealed from and is not an issue here and is the question that it maybe an issue that is view of this law protection, what possible purpose for his appearance before the grand jury will do?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="680.995" stopTime="737.722">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="680.995" offset="2798396">I think that, that is perhaps an appropriate interpretation of the decision of the Court of Appeals and it is exemplified at page 125 in the opinion of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.796" offset="2861613">Now appellant asserted in affidavit that there is nothing to which he could testify beyond that which he has already made public and for which therefore, his appearance is unnecessary and I question whether his appearance is unnecessary just because it appears in an article, there is some difference between testimony under oath and a newspaper article that is not protected by the District Court's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.894" offset="2989926">This is a rather definitive and positive statement, but I think its basis in the record is (Inaudible) and unattenuated.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="737.722" stopTime="740.197">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="737.722" offset="3025244">Now the whole paragraph now goes to that point --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="erwin_n_griswold" startTime="740.197" stopTime="889.123">
            <label>Mr. Erwin N. Griswold</label>
            <text syncTime="740.197" offset="3035170">Yes, but this particular statement can rest only on the affidavit of Earl Caldwell which appears at pages 17-19 of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.396" offset="3087938">This is an affidavit intended to be self-serving and without any executors and of course without cross examination and the only passage in the affidavit which bears any relation to this is on page 18 of the appendix about two inches above the bottom of the page where Mr. Caldwell said, “Generally” and generally certainly leaves quite a lot of room for discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.751" offset="3205384">“Generally, those matters which were made on a confidential or on a non-confidential or for publication basis have been published in articles I have written in 'The New York Times.' Conversely any matters which I have not thus far disclosed in published articles would have been given to me based on the understanding that they were confidential and would not be published.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.825" offset="3305694">”Well, in the first place what that word generally covers, what the exceptions maybe because obviously when you say generally, you recognize that there are exceptions, does not in any way appear and it is surely a legitimate subject of inquiry but there other aspects of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.952" offset="3390227">Mr. Hilliard has quoted in the article written by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.627" offset="3408930">That certainly is no longer confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.450" offset="3424186">What were the circumstances in which it was said?</text>
            <text syncTime="841.149" offset="3439023">Was it after an evening of drinks when people were talking pretty freely and loosely?</text>
            <text syncTime="846.473" offset="3460339">Was it puffing or boosting as a means of attracting attention?</text>
            <text syncTime="851.184" offset="3479148">Could it had been said in jest?</text>
            <text syncTime="854.650" offset="3493045">The government and the grand jury are as much interested in establishing the innocence of Mr. Hillard as in getting a further indictment against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.842" offset="3533796">This has not begun to cover the field of questions which an experienced examiner could direct his respondent within the limitations imposed by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.723" offset="3581339">But it isn't sufficient it seems to me to show that this key statement in the opinion of the court below has no adequate foundation in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="949.186" offset="3871193">The government has accepted the restriction as I believe it had to, I don't think it had any choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.248" offset="3899405">Conceivably we could have sought mandamus to compel the judge to remove this restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.135" offset="3926991">That would have involved long delays which at that time we were anxious to avoid and we did not foresee the long delay which had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.133" offset="3962935">We thought that the Court of Appeals would decide the case the other way and we could get on with the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.763" offset="4001492">We felt that the order, that the limitation was not appealable and that in our judgment discretion it was not wise to seek a review of it by a mandamus, but it by no means follows that we accepted it, thought it was correct, thought that it was warranted or indeed that it completely foreclosed any possible inquiry of Mr. Caldwell before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.890" offset="4121969">I believe that the decision of the Court of Appeals that he need not even appear is unprecedented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.820" offset="4157704">I know of no other decision that is held with a newsman or any other person need not appear before a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.142" offset="4195007">I suppose that everyone in the country except, the President of the United States, was amenable to subpoena before a grand jury, subject only to the privilege against self-incrimination after he got there and to the control of the court as to specific questions that might be put to him, such control being exercised after he appeared and it was known what those questions were and the reasons why he felt that he should not be required to answer them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1141.509" offset="4640447">And there was a case following the civil war, if I recall too, it was somebody against Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.420" offset="4672108">South Carolina against Johnson could it be in which it was held when President Johnson was not amenable to suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.218" offset="4703245">Though the question actually involved in this case is a relatively narrow one, there is a constant effort to treat the case on a broader basis in the numerous briefs which have been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.837" offset="4757789">But this Court has called upon here to decide only, whether a reporter can refuse to appear and testify before a grand jury about matters concededly non-confidential in nature on the ground that his appearance alone would jeopardize confidential relationships and thereby have a Chilling Effect on the freedom of the press guaranteed by the First Amendment, the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.882" offset="4881923">It's clear there's no privilege to newspaperman at Common Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.700" offset="4901149">A number of states have adopted statutes granting a privilege to newspaper reporters, but there has never been a federal statute to this effect and Bills which were granted have never come out of the committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.917" offset="4962067">Thus the respondent's position must rest exclusively on constitutional grounds, namely, that the First Amendment protects not only the right to print and publish without abridgment, but also provides a constitutionally protected right to have a wholly unconstrained road in gathering the news.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.216" offset="5063213">There is no foundation for this in the language of the First Amendment, surely in it's historical background or in prior decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.342" offset="5115771">Nevertheless, whatever this Court may do about the reporter's privilege generally, it should not justify his refusal even to appear before a grand jury, to testify only to matters concededly non-confidential in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.542" offset="5192571">Most of the material in this record, consisting largely of affidavits prepared by well known newsman is not relevant to this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.205" offset="5239174">Since with few exceptions they deal with the questions of confidential sources and confidential material, they were filed before Judge Zirpoli's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.298" offset="5287552">Nevertheless, the position that the reporter to need not even appear to answer the questions with respect to non-confidential material is argued vigorously, one might even say extravagantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.655" offset="5348992">Thus counsel for the respondent in his brief says, “to an extent never previously shown, this record documents, the devastating effect that the compulsion of newsman's testimony has upon freedom of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.591" offset="5424748">Yet as I have indicated with only one exception, the items relied on deal with confidential sources and confidential material which are not involved here and they are based solely on affidavits from newsman which are in their nature self-serving, and never subject to cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.032" offset="5518579">These affidavits do show that there is a reaching out among journalists for a reported source privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.027" offset="5554524">But such a desire among newsman as heretofore fallen short of establishing a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.159" offset="5599036">Since the briefs were filed in this case, we have a new source of information about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.297" offset="5623592">I am not sure just what it's status is, but there has been made available within the past two weeks, a study report of the Reporters' Committee on Freedom of the Press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.068" offset="5682628">This seems to be an ad hoc group of which Mr. Fred P. Graham of the New York Times has listed as coordinator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.355" offset="5719827">The work was done by Professor Vince Blasi of the University of Michigan Law School.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.927" offset="5750129">It's clearly a thoughtful, through and reasonably objective report subject to the comment that the information summarized was obtained only from reporters and others connected with the communications media.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.889" offset="5821913">In addition, a portion of the report has just been published in an article in the Michigan Law Review for December 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.735" offset="5865381">This is the Newsman's privilege and empirical study in 70 Michigan Law Review 229.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.415" offset="5904042">Now perhaps it's just my academic background that makes me regret that the Professor Blasi does not disclose in his Michigan article that his study was in fact commissioned by the Reporter's Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.907" offset="5958063">As I have indicated though within the plan that he has adopted, he appears to have done a careful and thoughtful job and the court may find some useful materials in the study or in the article.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.034" offset="6018563">One thing that does appear I think, is that reporters generally are much less intense about this than is the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.686" offset="6057120">Professor Blasi says for example, that the average newsman in the population survey relies on regular confidential sources in 22.2% of his stories and on first time confidential sources, in 12.2 2% of his stories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.865" offset="6133815">Another item of possible interest, it appears he asked his respondents, “In the last 18 months, has your coverage of any story been adversely affected by the possibility that you might be of subpoenaed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.173" offset="6195046">Of the 887 newsman who answered this question, 8% said yes, 10.9% said, I am not sure and 81.1% said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.113" offset="6262860">And again, in the respondent's brief in this case, a reporter Anthony Ripley is referred to and the statement is made that “Anthony Ripley was destroyed by being subjected to a subpoena,” that's on page 75 of the Respondent's Brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.306" offset="6343631">But Professor Blasi says in his report these incidents were personally very upsetting directly, but they did not significantly interfere with his reporting career.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.729" offset="6393368">He subsequently was able to do a superb investigative story on the shootout in Cleveland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.442" offset="6416147">Anthony Ripley's case is thus not as it is sometimes cited to be, referring to the brief in this case, an example of the subpoena causing an intolerable interference with news quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.989" offset="6490334">If there were a reported privilege not even to appear before a grand jury, found by this Court for the first time somewhere in the penumbra of the First Amendment where it's surely not within it's terms, how far is it to extend?</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.080" offset="6566716">To whom is it to be made available?</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.143" offset="6578942">Surely, it could not be limited to what might be called the established press like 'The New York Times' nor can it be limited to daily newspapers, or to newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.524" offset="6624499">It would have to apply to radio and television reporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.525" offset="6636516">It would also have to apply to the foreign language press, the underground press, the college press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.796" offset="6665564">It would have to apply to magazines and surely to pamphleteers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.662" offset="6684999">What about people who write books?</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.243" offset="6699419">And there are beginning to be assertions that there is an academic privilege, a privilege by academic persons not to testify about activities in which they have been engaged which bear some relation to their fields of interest and scholarship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.644" offset="6764934">If a privilege is not even to appear before grand jury is established on the part of the established press, I find it difficult to see where the limit can fairly be drawn with respect to anyone who publishes in any form or speaks, whether in the classroom or on the platform or on the street corner or an Union Square.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.981" offset="6854272">There maybe safeguards which are appropriate in particular cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.544" offset="6872558">This is not an issue in this case, but to hold that any person has a privilege not even to appear before a grand jury without a single question being asked, goes beyond anything that has yet been decided and seems to us to go too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.906" offset="6970047">The grand jury should not in this case, any more than in other cases, be required to predetermine and disclose the scope of it's investigation as a condition to calling the reporter who has undertaken to make public any statements including allegedly direct quotations from a number of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.389" offset="7067954">The press plays a great role in this country and rightly so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.313" offset="7087703">It has almost unlimited freedom to print what it pleases without prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.577" offset="7112676">As this Court's decisions last June in 'The New York Times' against the United States shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.655" offset="7140992">But as I read the opinions in that case, though a majority of the Court opposed prior restraint on the facts of that case, there was also a majority of the Court that seemed to say that the press can be held responsible through criminal sanctions when they are applicable, for what it does decide to print.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.528" offset="7232525">Surely, such possible criminal sanctions or civil liabilities for malicious libel which as far as I know, have never been barred, malicious libel, must have a chilling effect on the press to utilize that overused phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.863" offset="7309848">What this means is that the press, though having great freedom to print, likewise has many responsibilities of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.186" offset="7355196">Just as the press is responsible and can be held responsible for its actions, reporters are citizens and retain the responsibilities of citizenship at the very least.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.842" offset="7405770">Whereas here, protection has been given against disclosing confidential sources or confidential information, there is no basis for giving a privilege not even to appear before a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.583" offset="7464702">Since the court below in effect established such a privilege, which judgment should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1859.811" offset="7513603">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.237" offset="7539308">If constitutional adjudication were a process of picking the general legal doctrine that fitted a case most closely and applying it mechanically to result a specific controversy then the present case would involve an interactively difficult problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.649" offset="7665009">The government stands on a categorical imperative that the grand jury is entitled every man’s evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.871" offset="7701894">We would I suppose have to stand on a categorical imperative with equal abstraction on the other side that government may not abridge the freedom of the press and the court would have to pick between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.675" offset="7753094">Of course, that is not the issue, that is not our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.747" offset="7769394">But it is the government's position which stands I think rather woodenly on a proposition that whatever protection the First Amendment may give against specific questioning by grand jury, the obligation of a witness to appear before the grand jury is so absolute, saving only perhaps the President of the United States, that no situation, no conflict with any other right, however extreme, can qualify the grand jury’s right to have every witness appear before it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2198.545" offset="8868627">Nothing is more important than life, but one doesn’t reason back within the fact that deprivation of life maybe involved that other rights can’t be taken away by a process which jeopardizes specific constitutional guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.356" offset="8939784">The question in this case we think is as the government has stated whether or not Mr. Caldwell is required to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.893" offset="8969982">I would answer Your Honor’s question as to whether a witness was required to answer any specific question in the same way and which I answer the question whether he is obliged to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.893" offset="9010001">Fear for the safety of life would be no defense to refuse to answer to a specific question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.402" offset="9032049">Fear for the safety of life would be no excuse for not appearing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.183" offset="9047095">The government is drawing a distinction between appearing and answering a specific question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.646" offset="9068934">Surely, that distinction draws no sustenance from the fact that a grand jury witness is not permitted to refuse to appear because his life maybe in jeopardy, he is also not permitted to refuse to answer questions because his life maybe in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.138" offset="9126925">That is I think a totally different issue from the issue here where it's not the witness’ right primarily that is at stake at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.223" offset="9159317">What is primarily involved is the impact of the process of subpoenaing witnesses who are newsmen with the inevitable effect on the editorial decisions which are made, which I'll come back to, and also the process of gathering news upon the free flow of information of the problem, that I think poses a totally different problem than any question of personal safety of any one particular witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.062" offset="9278645">The government states the grand jury’s right to the testimony of every man in terms which I think bring to mind Justice Holmes’ favorite aphorism that every right tends to declare itself absolute to it's logical extreme, followed of course by the observation that in fact every right is not absolute to it's logical extreme, but is limited by the neighborhood of other principles which come to hold water, to hold their own against that right when a certain point is reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.366" offset="9423885">The question in this case very simply is whether the point has been reached, at which the general right which we do not contest at all of a grand jury to have the testimony of every man, to have every man appear is to be accommodated at all to concerns for the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.536" offset="9496506">We take a very different views from the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.454" offset="9504238">We don't stand on the proposition that nothing that the grand jury does which affects the First Amendment maybe permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.922" offset="9538093">We don't take the position that the First Amendment is the end of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.772" offset="9553453">What we think is involved is the accommodation of two very, very important concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.142" offset="9574978">The grand jury’s investigative process on the one hand and the reporter's investigative process on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.437" offset="9608101">And we think that the Court of Appeals properly, again on the narrow facts of this case struck the balance between those two by saying that, although ordinarily any witness must appear before a grand jury, that in a case of reporters, on the showing made on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.146" offset="9690961">The government may compel appearance only by making a foundation showing which it has never made or attempted to make in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.299" offset="9731608">Well, the government has presented the case in this Court both in its brief and the argument by taking really two positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.884" offset="9765985">But, the one that most stands on is that even if Mr. Caldwell has a right as a journalist protected by the First Amendment not to answer specific questions, but nevertheless he must appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.297" offset="9815618">Then the government appears to take the position, although is not argued separately this morning in detail that in fact the journalist doesn't even have any protection against specific questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.726" offset="9877267">Now, that way of phrasing the matter kind of requires me to argue my case backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.429" offset="9904121">I would like to start logically by demonstrating that as the Court of Appeals found and through the processes by which it found it, that a reporter does have some constitutional protection if there is some First Amendment interest implicated and the subpoena-compelled testimony of newsmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.683" offset="9977159">And that, that First Amendment interest requires some accommodation with the grand jury process and then I would like to proceed to discover what accommodation is required in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.764" offset="10017492">But since my argument time is limited and there are two other cases that follow this one, it will be of primarily with the question of whether the reporter has any First Amendment protection at all, I think I would like to start with the same position that the government took in this case and assume the validity of Judge Zirpoli's order and ask whether if Judge Zirpoli's order is proper and if this Court would affirm it, Mr. Caldwell should be entirely excused from appearing, then in what time I have left after that I can come back, if I can and deal with the question of the propriety of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.272" offset="10155523">Now, in dealing with that question I think it is very important to follow the course of litigation in this case and the positions that the parties have taken in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.859" offset="10209858">The litigation began by the service of the subpoena on Mr. Caldwell, it had a duces tecum rider which made very clear that he was to be questioned about the Black Panthers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.122" offset="10262939">Mr. Caldwell filed an affidavit in support of a motion to quash that subpoena which was cited that among other things, he had no unpublished, non-confidential information about the Black Panthers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.592" offset="10328767">I will read the specific terms in that affidavit for one second, but first thing I want to point out is this affidavit was not filed at latterly stage of this proceeding with an intent to ride himself into the protection of the district judge's orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.870" offset="10369832">This was quite at the very beginning before everybody had the faintest idea what the district judge's order was going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.905" offset="10393969">And Mr. Caldwell, the reason for the work generally at the beginning I should note of the quotation I am going to read which Mr. Griswold is focussed on is to explain the immediately preceding sentences in which Mr. Caldwell makes clear that to write a Panther's function with the press doesn't involve an on the record off the record type of a thing, it's an understanding of what is confidential and what is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.402" offset="10488010">It is in that context that he says generally, those matters which were made on non-confidential or for publication basis have been published in articles I have written in the New York Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.713" offset="10525208">Now, we get to the converse preposition which is the important one and which is qualified by  generally, conversely any matters which I have not thus far disclosed in published articles would have been given to me based on the understanding, that they were confidential and would not be published is a certain quite categorically that he does not have unpublished non confidential material about the Black Panthers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.634" offset="10620921">Now the government putting numerous affidavits, made no contest on this point whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.228" offset="10655298">The District Court came down with an order granting Mr. Caldwell a protection against specific questioning but requiring to go before the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.562" offset="10692601">During the course of proceedings under that when that Grand Jury expired, a new subpoena was issued, the government again had a full blown chance to contest factually the proposition on which the Court of Appeals later was to make its finding that Mr. Caldwell had no unpublished non-confidential information to give the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.575" offset="10772744">The government made no such showing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2681.917" offset="10802106">The government may not want -- may not know what Caldwell will be able to testify to and customarily it brings him before a Grand Jury to find out what its testimony would be?</text>

            <text syncTime="2706.325" offset="10899699">But where the claim is made, as it was in this case, that there are serious constitutional implications, harms to the First Amendment of his very appearance, then it quietly and properly inquire I believe whether there is anything that the government could get out of him if he went in front of the Grand Jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2742.437" offset="11044104">Well, that is precisely we think the implication of this Court's decisions for example in legislative investigation area, that although government is at a disadvantage in starting investigations, it may not start them in a way that has a drastic effect on the First Amendment simply on speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.896" offset="11126024">I agree that in many cases it maybe difficult for the government to know what a reporter knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.195" offset="11151206">But, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the government subpoenaed this man for a reason I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.824" offset="11173672">We think it is based in part on electronic eavesdropping, but the government says it subpoenaed him on basis of his stories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.218" offset="11199272">Now if there were any evidence in the stories that he had non confidential, unpublished information or if the government provide other information that we think it has about Mr. Caldwell's communication with the Panthers, there would be no difficulty Your Honors establishing what the government thinks that Mr. Caldwell knows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.573" offset="11288715">The government has not even suggested in this case anything that maybe non confidential and Mr. Caldwell has in many ways in which the government could go about making such a showing in face of his writings, anything that he had said outside of his writings, that the government may have overheard in terms of his communications with the Panthers something very much in issue in background of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2860.615" offset="11516816">Nor do I assert is what he published was confidential, his publication of it makes very clear that it was not confidential.</text>

            <text syncTime="2899.732" offset="11673342">Suppose the articles that were actually published showed concrete evidence of indictable offenses, do you think that the Grand Jury could just put those articles in the record of the Grand Jury and then indict on that basis or do you think that they ought to have the duty to call him and make the same statements under oath?</text>

            <text syncTime="2935.723" offset="11817329">I think that if the reporter's statement describes the elements of indictable offenses that the authentication of the story would in many but not all cases provide valuable information for the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.476" offset="11880336">Now one of the tests we propose as a foundation for calling a reporter before the Grand Jury is that, that information not be available through means that are less destructive of First Amendment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.713" offset="11925267">So I am not in answering Your Honor's question suggesting that I think that, that witness could always be called, but it was there would be totally different case in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.511" offset="11960480">Because here what we have is authentication, if any, of a proposition that David Hilliard said that the Black Panthers were revolutionary group and that this was serious.</text>
