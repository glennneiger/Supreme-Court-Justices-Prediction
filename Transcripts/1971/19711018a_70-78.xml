            <text syncTime="72.558" offset="363909">The matter now at bar involves the seemingly unrelated provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Ute Termination Act of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.428" offset="415423">These two seemingly unrelated statutes are drawn into focus in this case because both of them involved prohibitions against overreaching and both of them create limited fiduciary obligations with respect to those who are subject to their provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.763" offset="488774">The Ute Termination Act of 1954 had the effect of dividing the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservations into two entirely artificially created groups and directing that all of the assets of the reservations, including in particular, as far as the fact of this case are concerned, beneficial interest in the mineral estate, were to be divided between the two groups and to be distributed to the -- the Indians about to be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.953" offset="613535">Now, I note in passing that those who are responsible for the drafting of this law have referred to the group that was about to be terminated as mixed-bloods.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.719" offset="664526">The term “mixed-blood” is itself a slur, and it is offensive to the petitioners in this case who prefer to be referred to by the term “terminated Utes”.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.705" offset="712487">The petitioner Affiliated Ute Citizens of the State of Utah is the authorized representative of all the terminated Utes, which was formed in the manner specified in Section 6 of the Ute Termination Act by a constitution and bylaws which was duly ratified by the majority vote of all of the adult terminated Utes at a special election called by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>

            <text syncTime="249.988" offset="1073604">No one in these proceedings disputes that the Affiliated Ute Citizens was the organization which was formed in the manner specified by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.024" offset="1109757">There is, however, a rival organization, which we will discuss in some detail in these proceedings, known as the Ute Distribution Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.227" offset="1146642">The Ute Distribution Corporation is a corporation formed under the corporate laws of the State of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.449" offset="1175481">It was not formed by the adoption of a constitution and bylaws, it was not ratified by a majority vote of all terminated Ute Indians nor was it considered at a special election called by the Secretary for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.363" offset="1247161">That's the crux of the problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.270" offset="1258760">These are the -- these two rival organizations is the question of how the powers of the authorized representative could have been transferred from the Affiliated Ute Citizens, who admittedly were originally invested with those powers, to the Ute Distribution Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.331" offset="1335037">It is, thus, a conveyancing problem, plain and simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.915" offset="1349352">And I invite the Court to pay particular attention to the manner in which it is proposed that those powers were shifted one -- from one organization to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.489" offset="1399612">The question turns on the definition of authorized representatives as contained in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.807" offset="1424899">We're not concerned for the purpose of that definition with the question of ownership of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.208" offset="1450499">Section 10 of the Ute Termination Act which is the Section which defines the -- the authorized representative powers refers exclusively to the question of powers to manage the jointly held and -- and restricted assets of the two groups of Indians in the mineral estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.658" offset="1536285">It does not speak in terms of ownership of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.883" offset="1553212">The United States has proposed that the powers were transferred from AUC to UDC by virtue of the provisions of Section 13 of the Termination Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.589" offset="1596053">Section 13 by contrast speaks only and speaks exclusively of powers with respect to the ownership of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.569" offset="1635968">The joint -- the -- the authorized representative powers were not powers that had any relationship to the ownership of property and in particular, to the ownership of property by the individual mixed-blood or terminated Ute Indian, which is all that Section 13 relates to.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.111" offset="1718097">The individual petitioners in these proceedings are members of the Affiliated Ute Citizens who have brought a fraud claim based upon their sale of stock in the Ute Distribution Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.293" offset="1778910">Now, for the purpose of their fraud claim, and this distinction must be kept in mind, the question of the regularity of the formation of the Ute Distribution Corporation is not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.144" offset="1826244">It is not an issue because the proceeds from the management of this joint mineral estate over the period of time that we're here concerned with has been paid in the form of dividends through the Ute Distribution Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.193" offset="1882459">The recognition at this point that the Affiliated Ute Citizens as the proper authorized representative will not have the effect of restoring to the terminated Utes the dividends or the royalties which they have lost by reason of -- of those practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.783" offset="1948810">Thus, the regularity of Ute Distribution Corporation is an issue with respect to the Affiliated Utes part of the claim, it is not an issue with respect to the individual Indians fraud claims in the real side of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.942" offset="2013490">The defendants in the fraud claims are the First Security Bank of Utah and two of its officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.449" offset="2039508">The United States was not a defendant in the fraud claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.266" offset="2062704">The conduct of the bank and its officers arises by reason of its conduct in executing its duties under a business agent agreement which contemplated that they were to act as stock transfer agent to hit the books and reference of the corporation and perform certain incidental services.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.640" offset="2156223">It is the common element of the conduct of the bank pursuant to that practice which are important as far as the fraud claims are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.259" offset="2198750">These common elements affected every Indian sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.125" offset="2214214">It doesn't really matter who the sale was -- was negotiated with.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.768" offset="2236784">The common elements affected necessarily affected every sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.045" offset="2253921">By common elements I refer to the fact that every Indian stock certificate, which had bold, red letter legend, warning him of -- of its value and of restrictions on its transfer were locked up in the bank walls and the bank refused to make those certificates available to any Indian prior to August 27, 1964 even when he requested them and made no alternate effort to convey the purport of those warnings to the -- to the Indian who desire to sell his stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.263" offset="2378786">That practice affected every Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.116" offset="2394146">The bank and its officers were also acting in a capacity which we could loosely refer to as a market making function, that is they were encouraging purchasers of the stock, many of whom are located throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.115" offset="2466139">They were encouraging the -- the sale of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.282" offset="2482858">And in many cases, they were doing these things through the medium of agents on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.841" offset="2505010">That practice affected every Indian sale notwithstanding who he may have sold to.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.531" offset="2531863">In every Indian's sale, there was also a deviation from the regulatory provision which had been promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.041" offset="2569898">Specifically, the regulations require that any sale must be by endorsement of the certificate itself, never in the history of the Ute Termination Act, at least prior to August 27, 1964, was a sale negotiated in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.522" offset="2631756">The regulations also required that the superintendent of the reservation supervise the price and the terms of the sale according to the terms of the offer which require payments by cashier's check, certified check or postal money order, never was a sale supervised in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.333" offset="2715034">Those practices affected every Indian's transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.475" offset="2731543">Also, the bank and its officers neglected and failed to disclose to any of these Indians that they were acting on its dual capacity as market maker in relation to the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.312" offset="2786923">Now, it is true that there are also a large number of other facts which affected any particular Indian stock and the petitioner certainly take the position that those dissimilar facts standing alone would be sufficient to give rise to a fraud claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.868" offset="2861111">And the bank, in its briefs in this case, has attempted to focus on those dissimilar facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.627" offset="2900190">The petitioners take the position that it is not necessary to get involve in the dispute over whether any particular Indian got a car, whether economic pressures were applied to any particular Indian in its sole and what fashion the economic pressures were applied for the simple reason that the common elements, which necessarily affected every transaction, are sufficient to give rise to the fraud claims and were so determined by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.054" offset="3033937">The claim against the United States with respect to the sales of the Ute Distribution Corporation stock has brought them on negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.940" offset="3077405">It is the claim of the petitioners that the United States negligently permitted a deviation from the regulations which have been promulgated, permitted a deviation from their requirement that the endorsement of the stock certificate be the only way in which this -- the stock could be transferred substituted in its step the -- the transfer of the stock by means of a separate stock power.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.719" offset="3188582">That may seem unimportant on the surface that the effect of that deviation from the regulations was to withhold from the Indians the warnings which were -- which were printed on that stock for his benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.979" offset="3245633">The United States also, even though as we read the statute in regulations, Congress plainly directed that the superintendent was to regulate the price in terms of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.636" offset="3288265">Instead of doing so, the superintendent adopted a practice of -- of receiving a certificate from the Indian himself, the selling Indian who was legally in -- in the position of a war, that he had in fact received his -- his money.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.728" offset="3352631">Thus, there was a complete application of the responsibilities of the United States in that regard and the person who was legally in the position of the award was the one who the United States looked to -- to satisfy those -- those regulatory obligations whereas Congress, I think a fair reading of the Act would -- would bear me out on this plainly contemplated that BIA should --</text>

            <text syncTime="854.710" offset="3492543">That was the dominant purpose of the statute, but it's also true that Congress recognized in adopting the statute as it did in all of the termination acts that these people were going to have some trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.310" offset="3546877">They were not accustomed to managing property because they had been under the protective wing of the United States for so many years, and so Congress wisely, I think, directed that there'd be a face period three in which services and protections would be withdrawn from that, and that that period was to extend for a full 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.826" offset="3632977">Now, experience was proven that even that wasn't enough, that -- that these people needed protections even beyond what Congress contemplated, but the thing we are here complaining about is -- is that the protections which Congress directed were not secured to these people and that by reason of that, they were deprived of their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.040" offset="3733810">Now, in many ways, the complaint of these petitioners seems based upon fine distinctions in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.337" offset="3779054">We presented enough a lot of complex legal arguments in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.127" offset="3802146">In reality, however, we're talking about a very fundamental proposition, a very practical and fundamental proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.922" offset="3833388">We could analogize, I think, to a situation where it say, a person were to buy an annuity and pay for it throughout his life, and when that annuity were to mature, instead of the insurance company paying the proceeds of the annuity to the annuity simply took the proceeds and invest with it for his benefit will stay in a mutual fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.079" offset="3930041">Now, it is not a question of whether that investment is a good one or a bad one.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.333" offset="3947073">It's not a question in this case as to whether the Ute Distribution Corporation is a good idea or bad idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.335" offset="3975077">It's not a question of whether Ute Distribution Corporation was -- was well managed or whether it was mismanaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.336" offset="4007050">The problem really is the indignity of the Act itself to take a group of people such as these terminated Utes and say to them by way of congressional enactment that we're going to remove restrictions on -- on your person and on your property, and you're going to be treated like any other citizens in this country and yet before that property ever gets into that Indian's hands to take it and assign it, to have BIA assign it to this corporation, and not only to assignment but to make the assignment or purport to make the assignment irrevocable so that it would bind himself and his heirs forever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.491" offset="4163681">Now, Congress plainly declared in the statute that they were to receive their property in such a fashion that it could be inherited and decreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.178" offset="4198371">That is the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.630" offset="4208193">But BIA attempted to completely frustrate that -- the congressional intent by making this assignment to the Ute Distribution Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.922" offset="4253333">Now, turning to the Rule 10b-5 aspects of the case, this case represent for the first time in which this Court has had occasion to speak with reference to the fundamental ingredients of a cause of action under Rule 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.161" offset="4334312">I submit that the case is a very good one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.137" offset="4346224">It's a very good vehicle for this Court to consider the elements of a tried action under Rule 10b-5 because of the wide variety of misconduct which is alleged in this case, which accord this Court an opportunity to consider the whole array of possible conduct which could be considered as a violation of Rule 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.613" offset="4440161">It's also a good vehicle because the petitioners themselves have a peculiar need for the sort of protection which were afforded under Rule 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.743" offset="4480703">And this Court, many times in the past, in the Capital Gains case and -- and other cases which it has considered on -- on related issues have said that the need for investor protection is a relevant consideration which should be taken into account in determining whether any particular factual situation falls within the proscription of Rule 10b-5.</text>

            <text syncTime="1192.114" offset="4842133">It's inadequate for a number of reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.198" offset="5014437">Now, as I read Rule 10b-5, it basically requires inhibition to the jurisdictional elements, the showing of two elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.318" offset="5051008">And they are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.317" offset="5058949">First of all, there must be one or two prohibited acts, that is there must be in their brief a (Inaudible) or there must be a misstatement of a material fact or omission of statement of material facts or a course of business which is preclude might be build in a fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.306" offset="5146930">Secondly, that conduct, whatever it might be, must be accomplished in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.209" offset="5182561">Now, I stress the words “in connection with” because, as Professor Bromberg has said in his credos on the subject of Rule 10b-5, the words “in connection with” are elusive and we assume intentionally elusive (Inaudible) which is prescribed in any of the federal security laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.721" offset="5272526">Section 17 (a) of the 1933 Securities Act, for example, uses the term the fraudulent practice which is substantially the same must be in the offer or sale of a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.492" offset="5335638">It must be in the offer or sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.693" offset="5344415">This Act says “in connection with the offer or sale of a security”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.118" offset="5370120">The lower federal court in -- during the period of time that implied liability have been developing under the Exchange Act, Section 10 and Rule 10b-5 have wrestled with the question of whether additional elements may be engrafted on to those prescribed by the Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.682" offset="5436366">They have considered a wide assortment of additional element including scienter, proximate cause, reliance, I've incurred the principle, one could say it's considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.978" offset="5485581">The error of the court below in this case was that it went far beyond even what has been required in -- in other courts which have considered the elements and required in this case that there be a direct participation as a purchaser or a seller and that that direct participation must be for a promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.062" offset="5565934">Thus, the lower court in this case imposed upon these plaintiffs a standard which is far higher than even that which is described in Section 17 (a) of the 1933 Securities Act, and I might add, even higher than was required at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.857" offset="5641166">We submit that the limiting factors which are prescribed in the statute and rule itself are entirely adequate and are the only ones which ought to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.505" offset="5687664">I refer in particular to the requirement of a suing of materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.138" offset="5706263">The respondent bank itself is no different that even the Court, which talk in terms of reliance, quite often sum up defining reliance so that it comes out sounding just about like materiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.372" offset="5759135">The other limiting factor which was prescribed by the statute and rule is that of causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.519" offset="5783795">I note that the Rule itself does not meet the term "causation" but I have cited some legislative history in my brief which would indicate that Congress in considering the 1934 Act did make reference to the fact that any person who is injured by these practices or whose injury was caused by these practices ought to be able to recover and therefore I submit with causation in the (Inaudible) sense would be an appropriate limiting factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.651" offset="5904272">I think that that instruction has borne out by the language of the Act, and I know them particularly within this Act, Congress attempted to proscribe any misconduct (Inaudible) which is defined by the Rule in connection with any purchase or sale of security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.913" offset="5981385">I think the use of the term "any" in both of those contexts were the calculated one and that it should be given effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.205" offset="6014508">As I say the common law in cases most analogous to the fact now it bar does not impose a requirement nearly as high as that required by the Court of Appeals in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.438" offset="6071455">I cited in my brief the common law deceit cases which were -- which arose in the contract of market sales of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.002" offset="6109699">And what those cases stand for?</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.752" offset="6120670">And also some writings of Professor Thompson denoted expert on corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.274" offset="6142822">What those cases stand for is the proposition that if a person makes a misstatement were played by -- by means of a prospective and he distributes -- distributes it to the public at large in one case that was cited by means of leaving it at a bank so that any member of the public could pick it up and read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.422" offset="6215338">If there are lies in that prospective, any member in particular should be permitted to recover because it was directed to any member of the public thus, they come within the ambit of responsibility by contracts of the misrepresentation was made to a limited group why then also the ambit of responsibility which refer to be restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.156" offset="6302273">That was the rule at the common law and it is universally recognized that Rule 10b-5 is an expansion of -- of the common law and therefore, I submit that we should at least read this Rule as broadly as the provision of common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.807" offset="6368938">Now, they say the facts of this case and the legal questions are complex.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.632" offset="6676242">Now, Judge Christiansen felt that that would be -- that would not be a proper result because of the position of those shareholders who were not told.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.280" offset="6710828">And we -- I've cited his comments in -- in the appendix where he -- he makes reference that -- that it would seem unfair to -- to any such penalize those who did not sell by giving those less prudent who did sell the true value immediately whereas the others may have to wait that this may be (Inaudible) to recover that -- that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.767" offset="6808735">Now, I think that was a wise approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.450" offset="6819498">The trouble with it is that it leaves the benefit, the -- the remaining value of the mineral estate in the hands of the wrong jurors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1763.809" offset="7128892">The issue in the Affiliated Ute case is whether the District Court properly dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction finding that it was an unpresented pursuit against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.324" offset="7167031">The issue in the Reyos case from the other hand is whether the Court of Appeals properly found that the United States had no duty to prevent terminated mixed-blood Indians from selling their shares at less than fair market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.172" offset="7218335">Although the case has raised quite different issue so -- as counsel for the petitioner had said, those relate to the Ute Partition Act of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.212" offset="7250518">And I think that that fills that Act in a working of that Act is necessary for an understanding of the claims in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.179" offset="7278417">In 1954, the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation in Utah consisted of approximately 1800 members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.870" offset="7309137">There were two distinct groups, the -- the full-blood Indians and the mixed-blood Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.599" offset="7328050">The mixed-blood Ute Indians consisted of approximately one quarter of the 1803 -- 1800 members of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.992" offset="7357620">For a number of years, preceding 1954, there had been considerable fixing among the mixed-bloods and full-blood Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.265" offset="7382698">The reason for this is quite understandable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.570" offset="7391997">Many of the mixed-bloods do not live on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.591" offset="7404014">Many of the mixed-bloods were already integrated within the non-Indian society which standard of living was virtually indistinguishable from the non-Indian society in which they live and their educational status was the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.389" offset="7455214">The crutching between these two groups reached its peak in 1950 and 1951 when this group of Indians went on Ouray Reservation became entitled to 60% of the $31 million budget against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.879" offset="7509235">The full-blood Indians also quite understandably wished to increase money to -- to improve their reservation to build schools and hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.335" offset="7542985">However, many of the mixed-bloods wished to have the money in cash and had no interest from spending it on a reservation where, of course, they never lived and had not lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.226" offset="7578616">The groups met in tribal council over a period of approximately one year to work up these differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.823" offset="7600977">The Ute Partition Act of 1954 was the result of their compromise that represent more than anything else a treaty of peace between these two groups because the Act itself is drafted and hammered out by the Indians and then introduced at their request in Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="2563.973" offset="10329623">In Reyos, the 12 designated mixed-blood plaintiffs sold their stock during 1963, 1964 and 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.807" offset="10356895">It sued the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act and their claim was that the Government was negligent by selling -- to prevent them from selling their own shares for less than fair market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.885" offset="10397228">We think the Court of Appeals correctly held that the trust relationship between the Government and each individual mixed-blood terminated in 1961 before any of the sales took place and that the Government therefore had no duty to supervise mixed-blood sellers disposing of their stocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.581" offset="10460027">They pointed out under the Act that oil, gas and minerals were owned by the tribe and were not divided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.479" offset="10479566">But the proceeds were and the management rights were divided.The mixed-blood formed UDC in 1958 may issue stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.601" offset="10520108">Under 677d of the Act, the Secretary of Interior on August 27th, 1961, and this is on page 40 of our brief, issued a termination proclamation stating, “With respect to each and every individual mixed-blood, federal restriction from the property have been removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.299" offset="10594923">The federal trust relationship of such individual is terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.865" offset="10609134">That such individual shall not be entitled to any of the services performed for Indians because of his status as an Indian and all statutes of the United States which affecting the -- the course of their status of Indians shall no longer be applicable."</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.883" offset="10665245">We think that after this period, Secretary of Interior had no duty to say perhaps indeed no right to say to an Indian, “You can't sell your stock for that amount” or “I'll only let you sell your stock if you really need the money at this time” or even had he might have said that these were restricted Indian property, “You can only sell your stock if you spend the money in the proceed for -- for food and clothing for you and -- and your family”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.130" offset="10774228">We think that after 1961, he not only had no duty to do that, I think the mixed-blood would be -- would have been infuriated if he had tried to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.804" offset="10812889">The plaintiff had claimed however that there's -- right there was a right of first refusal and that they claimed this right of first refusal somehow created the duty on the part of the United States specifically the Bureau of Indian Affairs to supervise their shares even after 1961.</text>

            <text syncTime="2705.791" offset="10896899">We think the right of first refusal stems from Article VIII of the Articles of Incorporation of Ute Distribution Corporation which provides that any mixed-blood who sell their shares before August 27th, 1964 must first offer them to members of the tribe.</text>

            <text syncTime="2732.154" offset="11002329">The Secretary of Interior was -- was required under the Articles of Incorporation certified of one thing, that he offered to members of the tribe was made in accordance with the law and regulations of the Secretary of Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.688" offset="11056454">That is the original offer which, if not accepted, would allow the mixed-blood to sell to whom he may please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.748" offset="11084667">This is contained on page 6 of the exhibit appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.386" offset="11099191">Also, the regulation finally, I -- I may point out, that under the Act, under 677n of the Act was a similar right of first refusal for land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.935" offset="11137434">And so when the Secretary promulgated regulations dealing with the right of first refusal for land, the very last clause in those regulations stated that as far as practicable, these regulations should apply to sales of stocks in the corporations formed by the mixed-blood.</text>

            <text syncTime="2858.035" offset="11505865">And they worked out a procedure with the Ute Distribution Corporation whereby, and this is contained on page 29 and 31 -- 29 and 31 of the exhibit appendix, whereby after the offer had been made and not taken up by a member of the tribe to seller, when he completed the sale would furnished an affidavit and a stock power to the -- including the superintendent of reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.006" offset="11609728">And then the superintendent of reservation would issue the certificate stating that the offer, the original offer had been properly made to the bank, he would then transfer the stock to the buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.053" offset="11657898">Apparently, the main thing according to petitions of the superintendent did wrong here was that he failed to investigate whether the plaintiffs in this case were telling the truth on their affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.045" offset="11701888">The superintendent apparently thought that the regulations in the Ute Distribution Articles of Incorporation required only to certify that the original offer was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.227" offset="11738564">And I think maybe that was too strict in interpretation of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.821" offset="11756954">However, the one thing which seemed perfectly clear is that the right of first refusal did not create any duty for the people that were selling the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.117" offset="11794152">This apparently had not called it's true from their affidavit because the right of first refusal of anything was for the benefit of the people who (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.860" offset="11825081">It's for the benefit of the people who remained in -- remained in the tribe and also for the mixed-blood so they could retain control of their corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.817" offset="11856951">The seller obviously cannot accept its own offer and we think therefore that this created no duty to the people who bring this suit, the mixed-blood seller who claimed there had been -- have sold for less than fair market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.010" offset="11913689">We don't think they're entirely without protection however.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.531" offset="11923824">I think -- and point 3 -- part 3 of our brief deals with our question whether they're entitled to protection of Securities Exchange Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Marvin J. Bertoch</label>
            <text syncTime="2981.014" offset="11997699">Mr. Justice Douglas and if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.765" offset="12008774">I represent the respondent, the bank and the two individuals who are employed by the bank, Gale and Haslem.Of course, it is our desire that this Court sustained the decision of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.128" offset="12070214">One difficulty in this case in getting a (Inaudible) that counsel for the plaintiff and now the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with -- with its brief has constructed hypothetical facts that do not relate to the particular individuals, who were the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.484" offset="12167599">There is a suggestion, was made here today seems to be that somehow we (Inaudible) offered sale with some kind of fraudulent (Inaudible) which is (Inaudible) had this -- this stock or sale by all of the mixed-blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.587" offset="12232069">And the question, of course, was whether or not, Gale and Haslem are employees violated 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.511" offset="12259759">And the only way whether that can be ascertained and whether or not that affected, whether it caused damage to any of these 12 petitioners is to be found in the fact and the law related to those 12 individuals which is not to be found out here in abstract (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.830" offset="12345023">Plaintiffs' counsel or petitioners' counsel have insistently and repeatedly tailored a -- a code of many odious colors which has never been worn by and which does not fit any of the particular petitioners in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.755" offset="12416703">So I can only appeal to the Court in deciding this case has been only be determined whether or not these 12 individuals has -- have been injured or any of them have been caused damage because of the violation can be divided by examining the facts and the law with respect to each one of those individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.155" offset="12494339">Now, let's go to the Act which have been considered -- which may have been considered violative of 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.612" offset="12528089">Today, with respect to the wrongful acts of the facts or the corporate -- corporate itself, my friend and colleague Mr. Nielson has said that they retained these stock (Inaudible) whether its (Inaudible) or the Indians couldn't read, the mixed-bloods couldn't read this notation on it that they -- that have been (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.068" offset="12617950">Well, of course, that was done by the bank at the request of the Ute Distribution Corporation at the request of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the agreement of all three believing that would be helpful to the Indians so they wouldn't loose those shares of stocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.074" offset="12678032">That is hardly thought in having this part of its allusion of fraud which (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.996" offset="12701646">As far as the market making is concerned, which has been mentioned, the Circuit Court of Appeals specifically said there was no evidence with the bank, did anything about making markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.430" offset="12747413">And on these general matters where it is of no help to this Court and Mr. Nielson, and I just stand up here and he said he did and I say he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.612" offset="12780118">All he and I can do is refer you to the record and that is what I do, I just categorically deny that -- that there -- all these actions by the Government which created an atmosphere of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.020" offset="12829751">Well, let's talk about specific things that even the Circuit Court of Appeals said they're -- they did post a possibility of violation of 10b-5 in connection of the action with a couple of these -- of these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.956" offset="12889519">And I think we ought to examine those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.365" offset="12899132">And I'm willing to examine those words that where the Circuit Court said "Maybe you did, your man did violate Section 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.176" offset="12930374">Let's take Mr. Gale, it should be kept in mind first of all that there'd be 12 petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.167" offset="12954407">Mr. Gale bought stocks in only two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.576" offset="12971961">He bought five shares from Mr. Reed, five shares from Mrs. Wopsock and that's all he bought.</text>

            <text syncTime="3234.596" offset="13012085">He had nothing to do with encouraging the sale with participation in the sale of getting some benefits in the sale, nothing at all to do with them except in connection with some of them, he signed and notarized an affidavit or he's -- he (Inaudible) you see the signature on top of.</text>

            <text syncTime="3435.287" offset="13814881">It's maybe in the record, Your Honor but I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.985" offset="13841630">Now, the Circuit Court of Appeals said that (Inaudible) in connection with the sale, purchase of this five shares of stock with Mr. Reed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.040" offset="13881859">I'm asking it because I think this is my -- my most dangerous case, a violation of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.514" offset="13911743">That when he bought fives shares in January, the Circuit Court is to made both on this representation and perhaps a nondisclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.836" offset="13956987">He bought the shares for $350 and he sold them sometime later to another white man one for $530 who spend share.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.667" offset="13996379">Now, the Circuit says, and I certainly want (Inaudible) said, "There is in effect a misrepresentation here because he indicated that this man, Reed, has certainly applied the $350 worth of market."</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.553" offset="14047893">The value of the stock at that time when it wasn't because it's (Inaudible) sell up for $530 and maybe guilty of nondisclosure because he did not reveal from Mr. Reed that he was going to sell -- that he is going to sell it later for $530.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.402" offset="14111318">Now, this is no worst case, then the Circuit said, "However, there is no evidence even if this is a misrepresentation of a nondisclosure which would be in violation of 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.439" offset="14163459">There's no evidence that there was reliance here, that this was the cause of misrepresentation or this non-disclosure was the cause of the sale."</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.128" offset="14214241">Now, that -- of the one -- was that -- accept I want to put Haslem in -- in focus hereto because there is something that he did, the Circuit said (Inaudible) was in a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.854" offset="14265127">They said that if Haslem indicated when he purchased some stock, but that was the market price, he made a misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.830" offset="14300967">However, with Haslem, there is no evidence in the record that he ever sold it to anybody else at any profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.004" offset="14329702">So they cannot be found to be a violation of 10b-5 as far as she is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.144" offset="14354257">Then I was going back to Mr. Gale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.479" offset="14367632">The question we get down to the real question in place by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that is the subject to go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.537" offset="14407860">Now, I think we all get down (Inaudible) is the real bonus concession in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.801" offset="14432938">First, of course, I wanted to say about reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.578" offset="14447984">Is reliance to be -- to be assumed if the representation or the nondisclosure is material?</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.680" offset="14488422">Now, the reason about, I believe, because of the case Mills versus Auto-lite, this is a case in which -- decided by this Court last year and that the case which reserved the tension on as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.345" offset="14539099">It is a case in which -- which I believe is right and with which I do not coil it up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.197" offset="14562505">And the satisfaction is entirely different in that case and this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.515" offset="14575775">And the other like case you will recall is the matter of miner stockholder suing a class to set aside a merger on the grounds that a statement and a proxy -- proxy statement was -- was hailed to disclose that those of the selling -- of the merging corporation, the directors in the merging corporation sent out proxy were completely controlled by the Court relation into which it was to be merged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.145" offset="14706283">And so the lower court -- well, and as a matter of fact, they were thousands, according to Justice Harlan's opinion, there were thousands of stockholders involved and these are minority stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.047" offset="14761872">And the problem was in the trial and in the Circuit Court, how we're going to determine whether or not they relied on the nondisclosure that they were influenced by the nondisclosure in the proper statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.061" offset="14817983">Whether or not they would have voted otherwise had this fact been included in that Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.225" offset="14842538">And the Circuit Court and the trial came up with rather fictitious formula saying, "Well, this is the tough thing to do because there are thousands and they came in inquiring for just relying to each one causation with each one, we -- so we'll adopt its formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.003" offset="14901679">If it appears from the evidence that the merger was a good move, then we can assume that if they had known all of the facts, they would have bought it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.617" offset="14932190">Well, this Court, and I think quite properly said that doesn't improve anything and we're not going to accept that formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.527" offset="14955805">And this Court said -- and this, I think, as Justice Harlan was done exactly quoting the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.847" offset="14997078">He said that reliance of thousands can scarcely -- can scarcely be inquired inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.668" offset="15036366">So this Court decided that a case like that where the nondisclosure was something that everybody knew and knew what it was, where it was, certainly material.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.168" offset="15086312">Or the Court said, Justice Harlan said had a (Inaudible) it caused someone to vote one way or another, then we're going to assume that there was reliance, that there was causation, and the causation and the reliance and the materiality will merge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.909" offset="15153290">And I think that was properly made in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.538" offset="15171890">That these people could not have been protected any other where -- way when there were thousands of them, you can't put them on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.869" offset="15201147">This is an entirely different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.357" offset="15211073">In this case, there were 12 petitioners, every one of them took the stand and all the lawyer had to do to Mr. Reed would say, "Would you have sold your stocks if you'd been given this information," and he could have said yes or no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.378" offset="15275230">Everyone of them could have been asking if that -- if they relied or if they didn't rely because this caused them to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.913" offset="15313369">But that evidence was never in the record, never put in the record perhaps because counsel didn't know what they were going to say or they're going to say the trainer, they forgot to ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.687" offset="15352448">We don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.018" offset="15357777">But the fact is that it could easily be in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.268" offset="15366763">I don't think this Court wants to take the position for posterity that when you can determine whether there's reliance or causation without any doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.241" offset="15410649">That in those cases, we should assume it, and we don't have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.994" offset="15425695">I think that would be dangerous jurisprudence.</text>

            <label>Mr. Parker M. Nielson</label>
            <text syncTime="4309.599" offset="17312050">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.115" offset="17322185">Now, I note from Mr. Randolph's argument that he had nothing to say about the security's aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.459" offset="17359488">I remind the Court however, as I think the Court is aware that Securities and Exchange Commission has taken the position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.219" offset="17386551">I think it's regrettable that Mr. Randolph does not speak for that issue because I know that this Court has expressly added to in the past and cases such as the National Securities case that it is not desirable to decide these important securities issues without receiving the -- the benefit of the thinking of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.546" offset="17467844">However, they have appeared by way of their amicus brief, and I invite the Court to take careful attention to the position which they had taken and which I might say I should describe to it completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.483" offset="17515596">As far as this matter of the -- the legends on the stock which Mr. Bertoch referred to and indicated the -- that the stock was locked up in the bank with the request of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.657" offset="17584350">I think this Court ought to consider for a moment just what was going on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.074" offset="17609950">Why would they every -- even put that legend on the stock if it wasn't going to be given to the stockholder and -- so that he could read it and understand it?</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.622" offset="17648193">Why would they take the position that these people were fully competent and -- and capable of managing their affairs and -- and that they should be held to the strict standards of accountability that Mr. Randolph would now like to impose upon him and still, at the same time, take the position that they weren't even competent to handle that piece of paper?</text>
            <text syncTime="4412.199" offset="17722485">It's almost as if there was some guilty knowledge involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.674" offset="17736383">It's almost as if that legend was printed on the stock to try to mitigate the -- the circumstances that these -- these people would be in -- placed under.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.485" offset="17775671">Certainly, that's the view that the petitioners take, and we feel that there was a complete application of responsibilities here that gives rise to liability on the part of both the bank and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4437.633" offset="17824259">Now, with respect to this matter of reliance, I don't think we can go us -- over the matter of reliance as easily as Mr. Bertoch would like to and say that, "Well, just -- it just ought to be an element of the Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4449.345" offset="17871070">It ought to be an element of the statute."</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.055" offset="17877862">Because if we look at the statute, the construction of the statute and the construction of the Rule, it seems that Congress had a particular thing in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.406" offset="17919344">Congress, if it meant to say reliance, knew how to say that and -- and did show another context.</text>
            <text syncTime="4467.542" offset="17943899">I've directed the Court's attention in my brief to the provisions of Section 18 of the very same Act that we're talking about.</text>

            <label>Mr. Parker M. Nielson</label>
            <text syncTime="4479.706" offset="17992487">I think that the Commission's position in the List case was substantially right that -- as I recall they took the position that -- that it was not really a problem in List as a factual matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.118" offset="18042120">I've cited in my petition for certiorari at the brief that the SEC filed in the List case in which they took the very position that I am now espousing, which is that reliance should not be an element because it leads to confusing doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4505.155" offset="18094260">How are you going to prove the negative of the undisclosed fact?</text>
            <text syncTime="4508.995" offset="18109620">That's what Mr. Bertoch suggested that we should do when we go back to the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4512.496" offset="18123622">How am I going to ask one of these people if they -- if they relied upon something they didn't know about?</text>
            <text syncTime="4519.739" offset="18152670">You see, that's the problem we get into, and that's why reliance is not an appropriate concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.683" offset="18172419">But in Section 18 which deals with -- with reports filed with the Commission, there's a cause of action that was prescribed there for people who rely upon statements contained in those -- in those reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="4539.504" offset="18231664">Now, that's the very same act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.752" offset="18236680">And in that context, Congress said that you've got to show reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4544.364" offset="18251099">Also, in Section 11 (a) of the 1933 Securities Act, which this Court has held is in pari materia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.850" offset="18281088">Congress said that when a person brings an action based upon a prospectus, he must show reliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4559.023" offset="18309823">Now, in this Act, in -- in Section 10, Congress didn't say reliance, they substituted something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4566.067" offset="18337930">They said, “What you got to show is that it was immaterial”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4569.679" offset="18352454">And material is -- is a very nice limiting factor too, and as Mr. Bertoch has correctly pointed out, sometimes it means the same thing as reliance and sometimes it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="4580.402" offset="18395295">That -- that is the term which Congress selected, I think it's the one that this Court should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4586.136" offset="18418283">And I think that it isn't the business of this Court to be writing terms into the statute which Congress didn't put there, particularly when it appears in the context that Congress knew how to supply that term, if they thought that it should be an element of the cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.085" offset="18485992">Now, I'd like to turn to the Indian lines aspect of this case, and I'd like to start off by making reference to the dialogue between Mr. Justice White and Mr. Randolph relative to the authority for the establishment of the Ute Distribution Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.469" offset="18567599">Mr. Randolph indicated that there was statutory authority for the formation of the Ute Distribution Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.097" offset="18590064">I submit that he was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.064" offset="18597901">There was no such statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.227" offset="18606574">Section e -- Section 677e, which is the Section which Mr. Randolph directed Mr. Justice White to does not provide authority for -- for a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4642.150" offset="18642309">It provides authority for the adoption of a constitution and bylaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="4648.834" offset="18669059">Now, that's quite a different thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4651.014" offset="18677731">A membership association is quite a different thing from a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.164" offset="18694345">A corporation, a stock in corporation may be sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.435" offset="18707406">One cannot sell his right to membership in such unincorporated association.</text>
            <text syncTime="4664.407" offset="18731334">It's almost as if one were to form a corporation for -- for citizens of the United States and then permit them to sell their citizenship to -- to aliens who would -- who would come to this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.001" offset="18777728">I -- it -- it's -- to me, it's an absurdity, and I think that Congress had a definite thing in mind and -- and by substituting the corporation for the organization which Congress prescribed a very substantial change was brought in the -- in the statutory scheme, and it was one which resulted in the loss to these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4694.554" offset="18851916">Now, Mr. Randolph said that it was approved by the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="4698.105" offset="18866126">It was approved at a meeting of a quorum of 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.373" offset="18887233">Congress said that such an organization must be approved at a special meeting called for that purpose by the Secretary and by a majority vote of the adult mixed-blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="4714.266" offset="18930805">That was far in excess of 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.168" offset="18938329">I'm not sure exactly what the number was but it was something like about 140.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.693" offset="18956510">So you see, by -- by substituting the procedures under the plan of distribution and the -- and the constitution of AUC accorded procedures which Congress prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4731.251" offset="18998724">The -- the intent of Congress was emasculated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4734.802" offset="19012934">Congress said a majority of the adult mixed-bloods.</text>
            <text syncTime="4738.340" offset="19027041">Instead of doing that, they used the provisions in the constitution which permitted the vote of a mere 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="4746.170" offset="19058388">And there's another important thing here too, Mr. Justice White, that I think ought to be considered and that is --</text>
