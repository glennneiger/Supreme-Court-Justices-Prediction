            <label>Mr. Louis S. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="101.950" offset="481460">On the merits, if I may at the outset, I would like to present very briefly the three central points that petitioner believes are critical in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.306" offset="550946">One is that the case invites a policy decision in the area of labor management relations and they urge that the decision of this Court in the Republic Steel against Maddox governs this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.067" offset="633911">Number two, the substantive rights involved in this case, as in Maddox, derives simply from the contract, the collective bargain agreement, there is not such right is provided for in the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.763" offset="720742">Third, that our case is not at all an attack on the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.784" offset="756791">Our contract does not diminish rights under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.336" offset="783018">It enlarges rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.802" offset="796915">Now, the facts here are quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.093" offset="818022">Iowa Beef was and is engaged in the processing of meat and the shipment of meat interstate throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.700" offset="860445">The 14 respondents who bought -- who brought 14 separate actions in this case were employed and some of them are still employed by Iowa Beef in the Maintenance and Repair Department to keep the machinery in operation for production.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.389" offset="943201">They worked under a collective bargaining agreement which is set out in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.313" offset="970890">The agreement provides, among other things, for a lunch period.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.539" offset="999834">The respondents argue that -- did argue in the court below and that was sustained by the courts below on the facts, as to those facts, they argued that because the machinery broke down from time to time, they were called upon to do repair work during their lunch time, even though they got the lunch time later on or even when they were not actually called upon, that they were subject to call during their lunch time, in case there was a breakdown, for those reasons, the respondents argued that there was a violation of the collective bargaining agreement by the petitioner which then they say gave rise to a course of action under Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.337" offset="1207037">Now, the collective bargaining agreement also provides for grievance procedures and for arbitration in three or four steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.253" offset="1266701">Instead of proceeding through the grievance procedures, the respondents began these 14 separate actions directly under the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.428" offset="1319364">The Iowa Court sustained them on the merits of their claim and we do not challenge that here while we do not agree with the correctness of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.120" offset="1366175">But we did challenge, by answer and by motion, the point that these respondents should have applied or attempted the grievance and arbitration provisions, instead of proceeding directly to Court action of the Fair Labor Standards Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.539" offset="1459798">That was overruled and incidentally on the record, the record on page 4 of the record plainly states that these respondents admitted that they did not attempt to utilize the grievance procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.894" offset="4341313">It may well be -- and Mr. Justice Harlan in his special concurrence in the Arguelles case, the Simmons case which is very much unlike this because there we had a special statute in which the distinctive doctrines that had been applied to Simmons, traditionally since 1790 by the Congress and by the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.374" offset="4443191">The Simmons case applied, the Arguelles case applied that doctrine to that very special statute and that statute made no provision either for administrative enforcement, whereas under the Fair Labor Standards Act, they both could be enforcement as shown by the reports of the administrator himself cited in one of the footnotes to the original brief in this case indicates that very few actions are brought by employees and most of those that are brought by employees are brought by employees who came after the law had already had ceased to being in an employee of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.322" offset="4602956">So that Mr. Justice Harlan indicated plainly that that his understanding that the case of U.S. Bulk Carriers against Arguelles did not decide simply because that there was a statute that that made all the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.011" offset="4673695">The point was to examine the precise nature of that statute and see then which of the policies, arbitration on the one hand or direct section on the other hand of the statute should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.116" offset="4734195">And we respectfully submit here that our statute, the Fair Labor Standards Act Statute is not the type of statute that would come within the sweep of the Simmons case in the -- under the Arguelles' Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.944" offset="4801486">Quite the contrary, we have indicated in our brief that the Fair Labor Standards act is not unqualified and it is not all inclusive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1215.550" offset="4935860">And the four cases in the U.S. Courts of Appeals in Fair Labor Standards Acts cases indicate very plainly that two things are I think relevant here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1234.246" offset="5010675">It just says court action may be brought and secondly that the arbitrators are bound to apply the law by all provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act in reaching a decision in arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.953" offset="5073473">I believe that's pointed out too in Wilko against Swan and Mr. Justice White in the Arguelles case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.883" offset="7445183">As I have said, these employees sued solely under the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.405" offset="7459289">They sued under Section 16 (b) of the Act which is set out in respondent’s brief on pages F, on page A2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.895" offset="7493248">Under Section 16 (b), an employee is entitled to sue, “in any Court of competent jurisdiction to recover minimum wages or overtime compensation withheld in violation of the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.761" offset="7544761">Also, under Section 16 (b), an employer is entitled to liquidate the damages in an equal amount to the wages that were unlawfully withheld unless the employer “shows to the satisfaction of the Court that he acted in good faith and did not and had reasonable grounds for violating the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.019" offset="7625741">In that situation, “the Court may in its sound discretion order a lesser amount of liquidated damages.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.510" offset="7655730">Also under Act an employee is entitled to attorney’s fees from the defendant if he prevails and also he is entitled to two years within which to bring his suit or if the employer’s violation was willful he is entitled to three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.804" offset="7708915">The government contends that all these are matters of substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.724" offset="7720618">It is quite important to enforcement of the Act and the forum where the rights are to be enforced is tied up with the very rights and remedies of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.582" offset="7752069">It is an integral part of the statutory structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.338" offset="7763041">Indeed, Section 16 (b) itself speaks of “the right to bring an action and we think that when Congress said, employees have a right to bring an action” they meant just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.480" offset="7799612">They did not mean that employees have a right to bring an action unless they are governed by collective bargaining agreement, in which case they may or if they have to go to arbitration of the grievance processes first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.893" offset="7841303">We think examination, close examination of all these provisions in the Act, particularly in light of their legislative history leads to this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.961" offset="7873486">First of all let us look at liquidated damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.533" offset="7883831">Arbitrators as this Court has pointed out in Steelworkers charge, these are confined to an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.236" offset="7914655">The award is totally valid only so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.470" offset="7939524">In that situation and that is the situation in this case, under this collective bargaining agreement, it is doubtful at first whether an arbitrator could award liquidated damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.228" offset="7982574">It would have to go beyond the collective bargaining agreement to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.622" offset="7996157">Let's suppose he could, suppose the Court says that we can apply that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.969" offset="8013607">Well even if he could, the point is Congress said the Court should decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.431" offset="8027400">It is a Court, judicial discretion which is guided by sound legal principles is to be exercised in determining whether liquidated damages should be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.083" offset="8066061">More important, I have been assuming that case goes to arbitration, but under this collective bargaining agreement which quite typical after the very first step, the union has control over the grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.209" offset="8114544">The point is that the grievance may well be settled along the way before it reaches arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.648" offset="8132308">Indeed this Court has pointed on many occasions that this is the preferable way of handling disputes to get them settled because the grievance process itself is considered part of collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.851" offset="8173059">The only trouble is that is absolutely clear under the Fair Labor Standards Act that the minimum rights are not to be thrown on the bargaining table so that the union and employer can bargain agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.864" offset="8209108">This is something that that Congress gave the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.861" offset="8217153">It is a minimum standard and it is not to be reduced even upon agreement by the employer and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.640" offset="8240245">Indeed, in the Sholty case which was decided back in the 1940 and we discussed in our brier on pages 16 to 17, this Court held that even in an individual employee entering into a settlement, a bona fide settlement agreement over a claim with his employer could not be held to have waived his right to liquidate the damages, so let us go to union and do it for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.612" offset="8340138">Also, the Act as I said before provides that employee --</text>

            <text syncTime="2233.019" offset="9005738">That if the employee and employer get together and settle claim for less than the amount that was due, that gives the employer an advantage over his competitors who are bound to the minimum standards of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2323.891" offset="9369258">I mean I think they have many other things under the Act that indicate that Congress could not have been intended them to go through the grievance process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.105" offset="9394126">For example, the limitations on action when Congress gave these employers two years within which to sue before 1947, state law controlled the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.408" offset="9435295">They were diversion views and Congress found in 1947 that this lack of uniformity has created an undesirable situation in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="2351.543" offset="9479912">The point is they did this not only to get uniformity but because they believe employees might not generally know their rights under the Act and needed that long period of time within which to bring their suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.946" offset="9521499">Suppose we accept the employer's claim in this case that employees are barred from Court because they did not invoke grievance procedures when they were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.914" offset="9561310">This would bring about even greater lack of uniformity and that's precisely what Congress legislated against because if they take it that would mean that when the grievance process was available they would be bound by the terms of the grievance process which may set its own time limits or when they could bring the grievance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2427.379" offset="9783246">That certainly means the incident he is complaining about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.230" offset="9794636">So after he goes to his employer says and says, look you are doing something wrong under the contract then within 10 days, he has to file a written grievance.</text>

            <label>Mr. A. Raymond Randolph, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2443.804" offset="9848866">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.962" offset="9853568">No, I do not write that out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.062" offset="9857957">If he does receive a satisfactory answer, of course, there is no reason for him to file a written grievance, but the point is that all collective bargaining agreements set their own time limits and that is precisely the contrary what Congress wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.882" offset="9901215">They wanted a uniform standard throughout the country and they did not want 10 days or 15 days, or a year, they wanted two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.645" offset="9928278">So further indication, I think this is quite important is that before 1947, unions could bring actions on behalf of their own employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.074" offset="9965999">But in 1947, Congress under Section 16 (b), deleted the provision allowing representative actions so that now 16 (b) reads “that only the employee himself controls and prosecutes his own action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.544" offset="10031828">Compare that to the grievance process, it is precisely the opposite of what Congress said because in the grievance process, beyond the very first step where the employee steps down as written grievance it is the union that controls prosecution of the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.838" offset="10081042">That is directly contrary to a Congress legislated in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.363" offset="10099119">So further and I think I have been talking about this already, the point is that the maximum hours provision is concerned more simply than we ware simply helping the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.285" offset="10134854">This is an important part of the helping the individual employee bear the burden of having to worked over 40 hours, concerned with more than that, because one of the reasons that Congress set down a limit on maximum hours is to spread employment throughout the country by exerting pressure on employee -- employers to hire more people rather than working the people they have in an overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.626" offset="10220223">Also, since the minimum standards apply throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.440" offset="10235478">They have to be applied uniformly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.970" offset="10241539">If they are not, one employer gains an advantage over his competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.987" offset="10257630">Congress could not possibly have thought that they could realize, that these goals could be realized from the grievance process or even through arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.740" offset="10288663">The claims are settled by the union and the employer along the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.559" offset="10303919">The lack of uniformity is quite obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.700" offset="10312487">Each employer in each industry is going to be treated differently because the grievance process is tailored to the particular problems of the plant, but even if the matter reaches arbitration, arbitrators are not necessarily trained in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.358" offset="10367135">They don't necessarily fall to stare decisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.568" offset="10375912">They do not have to give reasons for their opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.318" offset="10386988">Their record is not as complete as in a Judicial Trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.056" offset="10401930">There is very limited judicial review of what they held and all these factors are quite important if you are going to have uniform interpretation of what is in fact of the Fourteenth Federal Enactment that applies to people throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.794" offset="10456892">In addition, finally, Congress in Section 16 (c) and Section 17 of the Act said the Secretary of Labor can enforce it even when the employee himself is unwilling or unable to bring the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.007" offset="10501718">Now, we think that it the Secretary has direct access to the Court, it makes little sense to say that employees don't, that they have to go though the grievance process where Secretary can bring an action directly in court and that the employee --</text>

            <text syncTime="2773.923" offset="11169408">I was discussing the Bulk Carrier’s case which this Court decided last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.402" offset="11187276">I also made reference to the McKinney case which was decided in 1957 which we have discussed on pages 24 to 25 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.048" offset="11221862">In both of these cases, this Court held that when Congress provided, the Court should be the forum for enforcing an employees' statutory rights, the employee was entitled to direct the access to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.180" offset="11270450">The Court so held in both cases even though the contract grievance procedures were available and even though determination of the employees' statutory rights required interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.929" offset="11325411">We think this is even a stronger case because in this case, they said at the outset, the employees' claims did not require interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.410" offset="11371282">Their claims under the Act of overtime compensation are derived entirely from the Fair Labor Standards Act and we think this case is also stronger than Bulk Carriers and McKinney because Congress' intent to afford direct access to the Courts is even more apparent than the provisions and policies of the Fair Labor Standards Act and it was with the respect of the statutes involved in McKinney and Bulk Carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.570" offset="11459994">Over the three decades, that have passed since enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, a considerable body of Federal law has developed through the State and Federal Court decisions construing and applying the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.205" offset="11510463">These decisions and the Acts provisions and legislative history together with administrative determinations must be considered in deciding the merits of every case that arises under the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.160" offset="11558319">The point is this is a job for the Courts and the not arbitrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.866" offset="11573157">An important point is that Congress made it a job for the Courts and certainly not a task that can be handled through bargaining by the union and the employer in grievance proceeding, particularly since employees’ rights, the minimum wages, and overtime compensation under the Fair Labor Standards Act cannot be bargained away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.025" offset="11649748">For these reasons, we urge the Court to affirm the decision of the Supreme Court of Iowa.</text>

            <text syncTime="2910.247" offset="11714636">I am the attorney representing the respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.208" offset="11730518">We are in full agreement with the law as expressed by the government as a general law, but we must return to the fact of the instant case to determine just what the rights of the respondents were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.784" offset="11792794">If we will refer to the contract, which was entered into by the Union and the management, the first thing we must realize that this is not a contract in any way, like a contract in Bulk Carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.381" offset="11867191">The contract in Bulk Carriers provided something to the effect that the arbitrators had the power to settle any and all disputes between the employees and the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.483" offset="11931661">We must return to the individual contract in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.223" offset="11950574">In the Steelworker cases and especially the Wheel case and also in the Warrior Gulf case, the Court held that the arbitrators power came from the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.477" offset="12015566">That is why we must refer to this individual contract that I have before me which is set out in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.213" offset="12050570">The first thing it does, it defines by its terms what a grievance is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.511" offset="12083694">A grievance pertains to the violation of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.568" offset="12107935">No reference to any and all problems between employer and employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.062" offset="12133953">No reference to any federal statutes, just a direct reference to this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.414" offset="12167390">Secondly, in Section 2 on page 30, the power of the arbitrator is specifically set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.447" offset="12219426">His decision in the grievance shall be final and binding on the party, provided he shall not have authority other than to apply the terms and conditions specifically set forth in this Contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.410" offset="12287344">So let us refer back to our instant case again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.338" offset="12315034">At no point, did any of the 14 respondents complained that they did not get a meal break, no place in their petition, no place in their reply, no place in the trial or lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.400" offset="12387341">The respondents admit, they got their meal break.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.384" offset="12403223">Under the facts in this case, the contract provides that they are entitled to a meal break.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.629" offset="12428197">It does not provide the length of the meal break whether it is five minutes or whether it is an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.650" offset="12456304">Now, there isn't any question that the employees got their meal break.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.136" offset="12470201">Under the facts in this case, they say five hours after they reported for work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.014" offset="12493712">They were on their meal break in a special cafeteria set aside, not the general cafeteria where the other labors were, but only the maintenance men were permitted to use this special cafeteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.486" offset="12543658">When the bell rang for a breakdown, if that was doing their lunch period, they left their lunch period, fixed the breach and came back and they were given their lunch break.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.815" offset="12596948">So we are not complaining abut the fact that we did not get a lunch break.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.586" offset="12611994">What we are complaining about is the fact that we never got paid under the Fair Labor Standards Act for the on call time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3162.219" offset="12722544">Yes, I would but I do not agree with the Supreme Court of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.651" offset="12736337">I think we got to consider that this is a different case, a much stronger case than either the McKinney case versus the Railroad or Republic Steel or even the case of Bulk Carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.511" offset="12799762">When we look at the McKinney case, we have a remedy based upon a contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.461" offset="12823481">The same is true in Bulk Carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.315" offset="12834975">When we go to the case of Republic Steel, we there have a contract right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.926" offset="12865382">But here we have a statutory right and a statutory remedy which the respondents went into the Court and requested it'd be enforced against the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.115" offset="12930165">Now insofar as they will admit and they do admit in their brief that before you can come under the terms of hours work which is Article 7 of the contract, you must first establish whether or not the meal times were subject to be paid because they were on call.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.528" offset="13023788">There is nothing in this contract about on call and then if we proceed to the next step, it seems apparent to me that the government intended that the Fair Labor Standard Act should be treated differently than other union regulations because of this two-year statute of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.499" offset="13115635">Now, it appears to me that the union fails in this and they take over the matter and they do not comply with their statute limitation which says in the event he does not receive a satisfactory answer he shall within ten days of the knowledge of the incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.063" offset="13189927">Not of the discussion with his employer, within knowledge of the incident he is barred unless he starts his grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.074" offset="13229947">This is going to create a tremendous hardship on the employees who are represented by a union and give a great advantage to a person who works on a non-union job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.351" offset="13295044">For this reason, under the Act, it provides the Portal-to-Portal Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act that number one, each work week is a separate incident or a separate cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.855" offset="13369127">Now, if we proceed then to the Portal-to-Portal Act where we have the two-year statute limitation and a recent amendment to three years, we find that we are penalizing someone who is working in a union job, taking away rights that a man in a non-union job would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.633" offset="13460242">And for this reason we feel that these people should be permitted; Number one, irregardless of any other rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.154" offset="13498277">That Maddox does not apply here because we do not have the type of contract that would permit arbitration by a fair return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.002" offset="13545715">Secondly, in the Bulk Carrier’s case and the dissent therein does not apply because Bulk Carriers have this very wide contractual agreement which said in effect we are going to let arbitrators settle any problem between an employer and an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.773" offset="13624814">Now, if the Court should decide that this was true in this case, then there would not be any reason why you could not require a man who was hurt in the plant under a state law to arbitrate workman’s compensation, that is the statutory right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.433" offset="13711436">So I feel that the Supreme Court of Iowa should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.886" offset="13729199">That there is not any statutory or congressional intent which would obviate that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.394" offset="13771308">I would also like to point out that the union contract is not in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.677" offset="13796386">The union itself is not in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.146" offset="13814254">There is no way for these people to obtain a remedy unless the basis of this and insofar as the facts of this case, in 1966, one year prior to the time of the filing of these suits an attempted grievance was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.141" offset="13902234">It never went beyond any formal situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.622" offset="13920206">The record is not clear as whether payment was made or whether it was not made, there are statements on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.005" offset="13957718">However, we must remember that that was a grievance according to the record on a failure to have a lunch period, not an on call lunch period and to show the problems that arose after these suits were filed, and a letter was sent out from the company which is a part of the record, instructing these people to use their grievance procedure and not to answer the bell if it rang.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.277" offset="14078822">When they refused to answer the bell, the foreman said to them, well, you answer to that bell, do not pay any attention to what those people say upstairs, they do not know what is going on down here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.300" offset="14122917">So I think that any attempt to make them do this would have been futile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.518" offset="14147785">So therefore I respectfully urge the Court to affirm the Supreme Court of the State of Iowa.</text>

            <text syncTime="3529.967" offset="14193552">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.393" offset="14223227">The amicus brief relies most largely for its position on the Brooklyn Savings Bank case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.545" offset="14251857">As we point out on page 22 of our brief, the Court there said that the Fair Labor Standards Act was designed to protect certain groups of the population from substandard wages due to the unequal bargaining power as between employer and employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.938" offset="14349450">We do not have that unequal bargaining power here and that is the reason for distinguishing collective bargaining agreements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3576.793" offset="14380902">So what you are after is the assertion that collective bargaining contract itself did not specifically give the arbitrator the power to hear a statutory as compared with a contractual claim?</text>

            <text syncTime="3592.881" offset="14445163">Mr. Justice White, our understanding is that the operation of the law is just the other way that under the opinion in Maddox and in the opinions in the Steelworkers cases, the rule seems to be as we understand it, laid down that arbitration does apply unless there is an express exclusion of some subject matter in the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="3622.877" offset="14565222">Well, this provision says that arbitration is limited to the construction and application of the contract and if a claim is asserted based on the statute, independent of any contract what business does the arbitrator got?</text>

            <text syncTime="3642.700" offset="14644530">I think that very point was Mr. Justice in the Buckley case in the Ninth Circuit and it was rejected for the reason that that becomes just a matter of semantics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.697" offset="14708477">The basis of the claim there as here was a violation of the contract, agreement to give a lunch period and a failure to give it because of the on call provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.939" offset="14765424">Now, that triggers entry into the remedial provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, but it does not provide the basic right and that was argued unsuccessfully by the parties in the Buckley case and decided our way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3719.577" offset="14952043">The Maddox, simply overruled the -- or simply reversed the case and left it there.</text>
