            <text syncTime="185.155" offset="814237">Well, I am not really all that familiar with the facts in this case because of the facial question that was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.680" offset="848405">We did not go into a great detail on the record in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.931" offset="865437">I feel that we can take the issues that were raised before the Supreme Court of Georgia as being issues that were raised before the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.837" offset="900964">In other words, these were the enumerations of the questions that were laid before the State Court for determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.317" offset="922907">The District Court found for instance that there had not been exhaustion as to the bulk of the material that was encompassed within the application for a writ of habeas corpus and refuse to consider the bulk of the contentions that were brought forth by the applicant, the appellee here at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.387" offset="999184">It turned only on the facial constitutionality and proceeded from there.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.884" offset="1025202">The holding in the case that I have just called the Court’s attention here deals with the question of the broadness of the concept to breach of the peace and I think it is very important because I think, Georgia at this point departs from its neighboring state of South Carolina to a very significant extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.278" offset="1086747">The Court held that one who commits a breach of the peace is of course guilty of disorderly conduct, but they went on to say, but not all disorderly conduct is necessarily a breach of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.566" offset="1135961">That is where its merely calculated to disturb are annoyed and I would submit that this is a pretty sound analysis, long before we ever gotten to this area of severe constitutional questions of what concerns the breaking of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.768" offset="1196774">Now we tend, I think in our decisions to take disruptions of the peace and actual breaches of the peace and mix them all together and of course that is the bias I find in many of the ordinances and statutes and common-law offenses as we find in state courts that this court has had to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.902" offset="1273261">In Edwards against South Carolina, we have a case where the offense was tainted in my mind by the circumstances of the state approved application.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.779" offset="1312758">And the court there noted the state could not make criminal, a peaceful expression of unpopular views and that was the width to which the breach of peace definition of the common-law crime adopted by the Supreme Court of South Carolina took the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.222" offset="1378587">The Court went on to note and I think rather significantly that the record which it looked at in the South Carolina case was barren of fighting words as that term is used and South Carolina had extended the concept of the breach of peace to encompass all forms of disorderly conduct, including conduct which was merely calculated to disturb or annoy and therein was a vice of this particular common-law offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.344" offset="1487047">I think we really get into a very similar situation in Cox and in Terminiello against Chicago where we have an application by state courts approved, and therefore, becoming an authoritative interpretation of the ordinance or statute involved which reaches out beyond the idea of breaching the peace and goes to the disruption of the peace in disturbing or annoying antics, conditions of words.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.485" offset="1611599">And the Court has held that that cannot necessarily be consistent with the First Amendment made unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.311" offset="1638871">The decision of the Court below in affecting corporates on this issue, the decision of the District Court and I was really somewhat surprised about this because of the first portion of the opinion, the Court of Appeals was not even arguing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.457" offset="1715462">The first question was just submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.397" offset="1723298">We spent the entire time arguing this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.309" offset="1734897">They ruled on the first issue on the theory that the Supreme Court of the United States should have the benefit of the Court of Appeals determination and then on the one issue that was really controlling the case did not give us any real benefit of their determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="539.582" offset="2231955">The Court below, the District Court seem to feel there was regular confusion in the Georgia cases in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.299" offset="2266854">Those cases are authoritatively construed under the provision under attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.432" offset="2283364">I think there was a rather obvious mistake in relying upon what was really bare bunk style of disposals of questions and procedures and evidentiary sufficiency in certain cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.238" offset="2330593">This resulted in fact with prior to 1902 and most of the authority in this case came out, we had a one tier appellate court system in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.878" offset="2361209">Of course, there was a tendency to take a decision and decided on exactly what was brought to the court and just really in what was in effect an order on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.528" offset="2395795">Many of the decisions dealt with questions of provocation and for reason or other there was a period of time when apparently the Trial Courts, when instructing the jury that this was or was not provocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.405" offset="2439262">Well of course provocation is not a defense under this defense and lack of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.125" offset="2458175">It is an element which a state must prove and therefore of course it was wrong to withdraw this question from the jury and in fact shift the burden to the defendant of coming in and showing that a certain set of facts was provocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.629" offset="2504151">He had no such burden in any evidence he brought into that case would simply go against the state to prove up law the provocation which is an element it must prove under this offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.579" offset="2543961">So I think when we view the offense in that area, actually review the decision as opposed to the language, only hang up on the language of some disordered propositions, we see that they are all quite consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.118" offset="2590146">In Fisk against State which is one of the cases that they indicate they feel there is a conflict between the Wilson decision some 63 years later, we have the language used and charges soar to a line and the trial judge instructed the jury that this was opprobrious words and abuse of language and the court said no you cannot do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.675" offset="2680320">You cannot instruct the jury as to an element of the offense which I think seems pretty obvious that you cannot tell the jury that this person has violated the statute, not least under our Georgia law where you cannot even make a trial judge a comment on it, much less withdraw in a criminal case have fortunately charge or the offense from consideration of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.160" offset="2758270">Now if we must view it against some backdrop of what is really involved in the case, the decision is quite clear and I think that the real difference in the quality of the language that we used in the Wilson case and that which was used in the Fisk case.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.418" offset="2827338">There are certain words quite obviously are going to be opprobrious or abusive if used to another person as what the Supreme Court said without a smile upon your face so to speak (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="1378.355" offset="5587122">Now just to show the way in which the District Court went of, it said that for instance they can see no reason constitutionally for protecting the kind of conduct Wilson engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.455" offset="5623485">But it went on to say it is construed by the Georgia Courts especially in the instant case that Georgia provision has to breach the peace as even broader than Louisiana statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.394" offset="5659220">But the Louisiana statute was so construed that it applied to conduct on the application itself that ought to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.787" offset="5692866">Now, he cannot cite an instance in which this is going to apply the conduct that ought to be protected, but it follows the circular pattern of reasoning down to conclude that this case is broader than Cox against Louisiana which I simply cannot follow the reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.740" offset="5752634">In other words, he says the conduct is not protected, ought not to be protected, cannot be made unlawful, in contrary we have a situation that was certainly protective type conduct involved and the statute was construed to cover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.126" offset="5806133">And I certainly can say how the statute as construed could be even reached the conduct involving the Cox against Louisiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="1643.245" offset="6646649">We are not consulted on that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.264" offset="6654694">So I just feel it and of course the Court is going to have to take the authoritative determinations made by the Georgia Court and read into them the issues that, I think, brought in outside by misinterpreting what the decisions rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.710" offset="6716552">I do not know how you can wipe out the Elmore case on physical resentment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.724" offset="6728569">And if you cannot constitutionally prohibit this kind of conduct I think perhaps that Smith’s real view was that we were prohibiting conduct that it fallen not so much if he was misunderstanding Georgia law, but he was misunderstanding the effect which this decision would have or the other decisions of this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.467" offset="6807563">Personally I do not believe this statute could ever reach the Cantwell's conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.761" offset="6824699">I doubt very seriously if it could ever reach say Feiner's conduct, in Feiner against New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.821" offset="6841000">It might very well have reached the conduct of a man mentioned in Mr. Justice Douglas’ concurring opinion who was calling up epitaphs to Feiner while he was speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.327" offset="6878929">It might under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.836" offset="6884990">That would be a question we would have to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.851" offset="6897111">This is intentional conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.570" offset="6903902">It is directed conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.752" offset="6908709">It directs to a specific victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.963" offset="6917486">It is intended to take effect upon that victim and it is intended or likely to produce a physical resentment from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.225" offset="6942564">This is in fighting words and I do not believe any legislature under the country can find fighting words other than fighting words and there again, we have a problem of what is the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.139" offset="6986240">The final point I would make Your Honor is I feel that the decisions of this Court approve exactly what the Georgia Court has done, Georgia decisions have construed in this case and I can only submit it to your review that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.725" offset="7060533">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.585" offset="7123958">We have already discussed the fact that the appellee here has a approximately two months left to serve in his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.359" offset="7151125">In addition to that factor is a three-judge court which has passed on the appropriateness of the statute as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.336" offset="7182995">This would bear on what we were just discussing as to how many Georgia Judges have ruled on the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.431" offset="7211416">In fact, Judge Morgan sat along with Circuit Judge Griffin Bell and District Judge Alexander Lawrence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1836.313" offset="7418933">I believe the reason is because he was going through the Georgia Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.863" offset="7437114">The record reflects that he appealed that through the Court of Appeals and also applied for certiorari in this Court and I expect that would probably take him about a year’s time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.651" offset="7496255">To return to my opening point, the point I would like to make is that not only do we have a three-judge court ruling, we have the Fifth Circuit Ruling, we also have a new statute in this area, Georgia Code annotated 26-2610.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.845" offset="7557068">The main statute is really for all intents and purposes, the same line that we are considering here, yet it continues to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.057" offset="7585907">Now, I think that may go to the question of what happens if this Court should overrule the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.936" offset="7609418">What effect will that decision have and it would appear that the Georgia Court seem to feel that the new statute is something different in that a separate room is going to be required on that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.107" offset="7658110">Naturally, we are arguing that this Court should have affirm the Fifth Circuit decision and I think this may support our argument simply by the point that any decision that we get on this particular case is probably going to have little effect both to our appellee and to others in like situation.</text>
