            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="10.611" offset="116743">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.154" offset="126878">I represent the petitioner in this case, Paul Pappas.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.850" offset="141716">This is the third case in the trilogy now, before the Court involving the First Amendment, a newsman.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.193" offset="163032">The facts in the case are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.902" offset="173899">Mr. Pappas is an experienced, professional newsman-photographer for WTEV-TV and with its principal offices in New Bedford, Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.193" offset="219038">The station covers all of Rhode Island, part of Massachusetts, part of Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.705" offset="241086">On July 30, 1970, he was in Providence, Rhode Island, when he received a call from his station, telling him to go to New Bedford.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.236" offset="279224">They seemed to be burning down New Bedford, was the message that he got, they were not identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.428" offset="307959">He went to New Bedford, to the west end of the town where apparently that’s his orders had been described for him and he there ran into a barricade.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.688" offset="337007">He therefore returned to the New Bedford office, after which he received another call, from his superiors telling him that he went back to the area, he would be allowed into the area through the barricade.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.110" offset="402731">He returned and he set up his cameras outside a boarded-up variety store, which apparently was being used as headquarters for the Black Panthers.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.229" offset="451215">He set up his camera and a spokesman for the Panthers came out of the store with about a dozen blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.083" offset="482562">They gathered and the spokesman gave a press interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.747" offset="497295">There were approximately five newsmen present, including Mr. Pappas.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.019" offset="518297">All of the films which Mr. Pappas took of the news conference were subsequently given to and viewed by the District Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.215" offset="567094">The next sequence of facts which actually gave rise to this case were prompted by two occurrences.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.933" offset="598023">First, during the news conference, the spokesman said that the police would be allowed into the store if they had search warrants, if they conducted themselves in a gentlemanly manner and if they were accompanied by the news media.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.865" offset="669703">The second occurrence was that at a kind of side conference after the spokesman has gotten through with this more formal press conference, the Panthers complained to Mr. Pappas that the news media always covered the side of the police in circumstances such as these.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.980" offset="742219">And on this point, Mr. Pappas said, “Well, that’s because the media are never allowed to show any other side.”</text>
            <text syncTime="175.288" offset="775447">Now it was as a result of these two occurrences that the Panthers then agreed with Mr. Pappas that he would be allowed into their headquarters that evening, to spend the night if he wished, if he came back personally, but there was a condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.838" offset="853605">If there was a raid, they said, he would be allowed to report and photograph anything that took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.999" offset="886310">On the other hand, if there was no raid, there was no raid, any as he put it anything I saw or heard would be strictly in confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.297" offset="935420">Later that night, after he had been accompanied back to and into the headquarters, these conditions were reimposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.770" offset="965304">They were specifically stated again and he again agreed to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.722" offset="981187">As a matter of fact there was adverse comment about whether he might not be a police stoolie and he assured them no, he was there as a representative of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.730" offset="1017236">He understands he was that if there was a police raid, he was free to cover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.076" offset="1034581">If there was no police raid, he would keep whatever he saw or heard in confidence.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="244.624" offset="1052762">Suppose right there, Mr. Prettyman that an unexpected event took place then, not the police raid, but suppose some internal quarrel of the group resulted in one of them killing another in his site.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.303" offset="1119531">Do you think that pledge of confidence would be protected?</text>

            <text syncTime="268.241" offset="1147221">I think that in the subsequent hearing, on whether they were overriding public interest in the production of his testimony, it might well sway the Court that he saw during the period of confidentiality and privilege and of that which was so vital to the public interest that he should be required to testify, anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="310.746" offset="1317226">How serious was the event that he saw?</text>
            <text syncTime="314.956" offset="1334049">Was there any other source for getting the information?</text>
            <text syncTime="317.697" offset="1345020">What was the public interest in it? Did he in fact have the relevant information, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.354" offset="1367695">These are the very factors that a Court would consider in determining whether he should be made to testify.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.119" offset="1530699">If anything occurred inside there, then that was privileged but the Court might well find, in a given circumstance, that the public interest overrode the privilege, as it does any --</text>

            <text syncTime="394.350" offset="1651698">There obviously was something about his demeanor and his seriousness at the time of the press conference which made them believe that they could trust this man.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.580" offset="1868619">First of all, that there is absolutely no evidence in this record of any crime occurring during these three hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.214" offset="1887113">I want to make that clear, because this is not a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.429" offset="1903936">Secondly, assuming that there was a crime then I would say that they have to show that the Grand Jury is investigating a specific crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.269" offset="1939358">I would say they would show that he had at least probable cause to believe that he had information relating to that crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.569" offset="1972586">Number three, that there was no other available source for receiving, obtaining the same information.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.598" offset="1996619">And finally, that there was, as this court put it in Gibson, an overriding interest on the part of the public in obtaining that information.</text>

            <text syncTime="505.617" offset="2096720">I confess that a rule could be fashion that wouldn’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.019" offset="2106333">In my own view, I think for example to take the Branzburg case that it’s more vital that the public know that a youngster can get a drink in that community, far harder that he can get pot.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.342" offset="2155652">He can get pot virtually by asking for it and then, he can’t get a drink.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.791" offset="2185432">I think it’s more important that the public know that and that those boys be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.955" offset="2202046">On the other hand, I can well see that in a murder case, in a desperate crime situation, that the interest might apply other way.</text>

            <text syncTime="552.207" offset="2283130">The -- there must be some predictability involved in applying these rules you’re suggesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.834" offset="2329628">And I just wonder if the rules you suggested would allow any person who was worried about disclosure to predict whether a reporter’s claim and privilege would be respected or not, in this particular case, on an ad hoc case to case balancing?</text>

            <text syncTime="584.522" offset="2412384">There -- in a prior restraint case you do have your exceptions, but the fact is, that a 99% of the cases, there can be no prior restraint and here I would say that the predictability comes because a 99% of the case, the privilege stands and the prosecutors know that and they’re not going to issue the subpoenas unless --</text>

            <text syncTime="725.484" offset="2976211">My answer is that while it’s quite true that in many instances the Grand Jury will go from one crime to another or will go from suspicion to fact that where you have First Amendment privilege involved, the heavy duty involved in the prosecution in trammeling on that privilege that there, there is a duty to indicate that kind of situation that they’re inquiring into.</text>

            <text syncTime="780.239" offset="3195221">I think, there’s a duty and a burden upon them to come forward with an indication of what it is that they’re investigating.</text>

            <text syncTime="2157.526" offset="8704341">Now, that is the kind of thing that we face here if you allow Grand Juries without any sanctions at all, any control, any burden on the Government, simply to subpoena someone at will who has received confidential information as part of the press, part of its duty to disseminate news to the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="2330.534" offset="9396377">Well, but Your Honor, I think in a whole serious of cases the Court has done precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.120" offset="9414767">I think in Lamont, Bantam Books, Bates, Dombrowski, Talley what the Court has done is not to say that in this particular instance, there has been a suppression of a First Amendment right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.382" offset="9471819">I think what the Court has done in those cases is to say that if you are going to engage in the type of governmental interference involved in those cases, it is gong to have a future chilling effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.706" offset="9525109">And therefore, I think it is incumbent upon the Court to look about, look not only to the instant case but to look at the kind of abuse that could be inherent in a refusal to recognize the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.179" offset="9579025">I think certainly, it can look to what is likely to happen if you do not establish the privilege here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.082" offset="9606611">You got to remember, we’re not trying to set a set rule here which a newsman can for all time and under any circumstances simply assert privilege and go home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.521" offset="9656348">If he asserts it without warrant, if he asserts it then the situation he is not entitled to, that can be determined by Court and that’s the kind of adjudication that’s constantly going on in all kinds of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.589" offset="9704622">But, yes I do think that in determining chilling effect affect for their future that the Court can look at what might well go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.788" offset="9745373">In the case, for example, where the statute recall -- attempted to make a pamphleteers name and address appear on the pamphlet, the Court didn’t say that in that particular instance, it would hurt the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.697" offset="9797096">It said that that would detour people in the future from engaging in this kind of First Amendment exercise of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.029" offset="9830428">Yes, I do think, absolutely that you can look at the kinds of abuses that not only have occurred but might likely occur.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph J. Hurley</label>
            <text syncTime="2513.143" offset="10126865">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.533" offset="10140449">May I say at the outset that in my view there’s no question here whether a newsman’s confidences are going to be protected or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.128" offset="10190813">The real question is to what extent and how, by what means, and in what circumstances?</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.841" offset="10225608">I do say however, with respect to the contention that Mr. Pappas makes that as I understand his contention, a newsman merely by virtue of being a newsman, as an indispensable part of his job, if you will, must be given the privilege not to give evidence that he has acquired about a crime, because he has acquired it “in confidence” and that the reason for this privilege and the reason it arises to the constitutional level is that without this privilege, there will be substantial interference, substantial impairment of the right of free press.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.577" offset="10460606">Now, the Commonwealth position is with respect that this Court is not in a position to rule as Judge Zirpoli found in the District Court opinion in Caldwell that it is indispensable that a newsman, all newsmen under all conditions have this privilege, qualified though it maybe, that it is essential to the operation of a free press that newsmen have this privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.106" offset="10610653">I submit that unless this Court can rule that such a privilege is indispensable to the operation of a free press, this case does not rise to the constitutional level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.106" offset="10666660">And it then becomes a matter at least so far as the State Courts are concerned for the States to determine whether and to what extent newsmen will be privileged whether it’s a qualified or an absolute privilege not to disclose evidence of crime if they have obtained in confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.704" offset="10761118">A matter, in other words, for legislation in the States and absent legislation, a matter for the same judicial protection afforded to any citizen against improper, oppressive, unreasonable inquiry, whether it be by a Grand Jury or whether it be on the witness stand in the course of a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.343" offset="10875639">I think I should state a few additional facts of the Pappas situation because some of the facts that my brother has given, I think may alter my view of the legal problem involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.929" offset="10950036">And particularly the point as to the terms and conditions under which Pappas entered the Black Panther headquarters on this night.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.575" offset="10984518">And my brother stated, if I understood him correctly, that the agreement was that Pappas would be allowed into the Black Panther headquarters with the understanding he would report nothing, except a police raid and then if there were a police raid all bets were off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.146" offset="11070826">And if my brother meant that it’s his understanding that the agreement was that if there was a raid, any question of confidence ended, I submit that’s not what the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.733" offset="11121190">And I think this difference is important for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.455" offset="11136132">I say the record shows clearly that what Pappas agreed to do was to keep in confidence, not to report anything he saw or heard inside that headquarters on that night except a police raid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.357" offset="11207708">In other words, what Pappas was agreeing to do is not the ordinary newsman confidential source situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.374" offset="11243757">What Pappas was agreeing to do was to silence himself as to event “A”, namely what might go on inside that headquarters other than in the course of a police raid, as the price of a possible story about event “B”, the police raid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.071" offset="11346575">What I’m really saying is, that if this Court should disagree and rule that it is indispensable to a free press that a reporter have such a privilege then certainly the Court should rule that that privilege does not extend to a situation where a reporter seals his lips, not for the purpose of getting information, which he is going to use in one way or another as a reporter, but where he silences himself as the price of a story.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.890" offset="11493801">Because I submit the two are substantially different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.953" offset="11506131">In the second situation, the situation that existed here is almost like the situation postulated by Mr. Justice Marshall, the reporter who sees a crime merely as a witness and not as a newsman.</text>

            <text syncTime="2927.171" offset="11782924">I would draw a distinction, suppose Pappas had been really writing about the Black Panthers, and as my brother said, for all if the record knows, unlike Mr. Caldwell, Mr. Pappas is certainly not an expert on the Black Panther.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.135" offset="11834856">I don’t say that to disparage him but merely to point out a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.833" offset="11849589">But let’s suppose he were engaged in becoming an expert on the Black Panthers, and he said, “Look, let me in and let me find out what you people really do in there and I won’t report it, but it will be useful to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.286" offset="11903401">I want to find out your side.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.941" offset="11909984">I want to be able to report your side, not specifically what goes on in here but just to enrich my understanding of the Panthers, as background.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.521" offset="11944361">If he had done that, I would not be making the point I am now making.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.617" offset="11960766">But he didn’t and I think it’s important to keep that in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.690" offset="11977066">I would also like to develop just somewhat more -- the fact situation because a suggestion has been made not so much perhaps in my brother’s oral argument as in his brief and reply brief that there may be some suspicion here as to how seriously motivated this Grand Jury was, whether there was a fishing expedition or possibly politically motivated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.401" offset="12083855">And I would like to point out to Your Honors that the record shows that in New Bedford, in July of 1970, and specifically on the 30 -- on the 30th day of July, Pappas was brought in from Providence because there were fires going on and he himself was told by his own station “they seem to be burning the city down.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.577" offset="12168596">That doesn’t mean that there was a rush of accidental fires, the only inference is there’s something going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.460" offset="12196077">Particularly, when you couple that with and these are the words his own counsel used at the hearing in the superior court, “There was turmoil there, you went to report on the turmoil, the disturbances, the disorders,” and Pappas said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.821" offset="12257517">So, he’s obviously called in, not to report another great New Bedford fire because there’s something in the nature of -- if you will, a riot, a civil disorder going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.706" offset="12313105">The barricades, they are mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.835" offset="12321569">My brother at one point in his brief wants the Court to infer that these may have been police lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.857" offset="12345706">Well, obviously the language of the street barricade is not that of the police line, but I think we can infer it from Pappas’ own testimony, in the superior court, as it appears in the record that he tried to get initially to the point where he was told to go for the conference, the Panther Headquarters, and he couldn’t get there because there was a barricade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.516" offset="12432328">That’s not a police line, he left and he reported this fact to his station and was told a few minutes later, “Go back, they will now let you in.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.925" offset="12474020">That’s not the way we identified public authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.077" offset="12486558">And this becomes even clearer because the statement that was read, which Mr. Pappas did hear outside in the street and did report said in part that they, the area people will let the police into the area, not into the stores, my brother said, but into the area provided they have a search warrant, provided there gentlemanly, provided they bring the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.190" offset="12598989">Now this is not the language of a police line, there is no question as our Court noticed that there were serious civil disorders, that these involve exclusion of the public from various areas of New Bedford, not by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.380" offset="12667744">We were dealing in other words, with a situation amounting to or smacking of anarchy, civil revolution, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.475" offset="12708181">And indeed, well, it’s not in the record, the Grand Jury that questioned or sought to question Pappas did return some indictments against individuals in connection with conspiracy, with weapons offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.571" offset="12776518">And Pappas was asked about whether there was ammunition in the Panther Headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.095" offset="12802640">And while I’m on that point, again, I submit to the Court, there could have been no question in Mr. Pappas mind, what he was being interrogated about before the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.141" offset="12850810">It’s true, the form of the subpoena was general, but be -- perhaps it was necessarily general because the Grand Jury was not inquiring into a specific crime, Commonwealth versus Jones, it was looking into a general situation, the disorders that occurred in New Bedford at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.220" offset="12935133">And Pappas was asked and did respond, was he there and how he happen to be there in the circumstances and so forth, so there was never any question in his mind that what they wanted to know from him and the questions that he was asked that he refuse to answer all related to what he saw and heard in that Black Panther headquarters in this period of three hours that he was there, there never couldn’t have been any doubt in his mind, certainly at that point as to what the Grand Jury wanted to know from him and the fact that he refuse to answer questions and the indictments I referred to were now crossed by the District Attorney subsequently because of his decision, there wasn’t enough evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.645" offset="13108900">And maybe if they had gotten Pappas evidence, they would’ve been enough, but they certainly can’t think of any question in his mind as to what he was being asked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.508" offset="13160309">So far as the facts are concerned, therefore, I would like to stress them for --</text>

            <text syncTime="4080.530" offset="16396358">I think it’s unworkable, it’s unrealistic, and it’s unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.205" offset="16411091">I’m interested, for example just quickly looking at the appendix in Caldwell, all the 121 subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4094.054" offset="16450483">They were served on NBC and ABC over 31 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.415" offset="16471904">First of all, only 72 of them were in criminal cases, 18 in Grand Juries, and 43 of them in criminal cases were by defendants, not by the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.314" offset="16519551">And out of all those that was served by the prosecution, and that 121, excluding three that came out of the Caldwell Grand Jury, there’s only one that I would describe as possibly seeking confidential information from a reporter and that was a subpoena to a station, to bring in effect everything you’ve got on the Mafia or Cosa Nostra and some other named individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.362" offset="16623727">The only one that you could possible say and of all these 121, only seven of them where subpoenas ad testificandum and those were all served by defendants in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.283" offset="16683391">So, I wonder really is this the practical problem?</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.296" offset="16699482">The evidence of those subpoenas suggests to me that it isn’t the practical problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.005" offset="16726336">We are dealing with the unusual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.464" offset="16740129">I don’t mean to minimize the importance of the problem by saying it really occurred, but what I am saying is that the solution is not in ruling that every newsman has got a Constitutional right, and he’s got to have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.240" offset="16803241">We give an attorney a privilege why?</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.839" offset="16813585">To do his job, can it really be said that every newsman to do his job has got to have an analogous and a greater privilege?</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.071" offset="16854545">The newsman privilege would be greater than my privilege, as I understand it because not everything I get in confidence from a client is privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="4203.056" offset="16886519">If he tells me he’s going to commit a crime, I’m not privileged not to testify, and yet the newsman would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4210.046" offset="16914418">And the answer is by doing it in an individual basis, either under legislation, if the legislature sees fit to enact it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.221" offset="16951198">Or let the Court protect as the Court protects every citizen against unreasonable inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.944" offset="16982023">And if the individual doesn’t have to prove that the whole inquiry is unreasonable or oppressive, as my brother suggest, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.274" offset="17015355">But only that the questions directed to him are unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.276" offset="17035417">And finally as a practical matter, we all know as practical men prosecutors don’t pick fights with the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.002" offset="17062271">We know reporters work out accommodations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.273" offset="17075332">Reporters do come forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.401" offset="17083900">Everybody learns in public life, you don’t pick fights with the press because they go to press everyday.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.100" offset="17110650">I wonder therefore, are we going to leave the press as helpless as it is suggested, if this privilege is not held to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="4270.764" offset="17157357">I think it was Oscar Wilde who said, “In America, the President reigns,” and that’s his words, not mine, “for four years, but the press rules forever.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.591" offset="17200616">And I think there’s a great deal of practical common sense in saying, “Sure, let’s protect the reporter and his confidence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4288.683" offset="17229037">When in a particular case, it is shown as a result as a Judicial Inquiry that the harm to him in his capacity as a reporter outweighs the public good that would be served and remember, we’re talking -- I’m finish Your Honor.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Bradford Reynolds</label>
            <text syncTime="4381.766" offset="17601334">No, I really contend that -- merely to make a couple of additional observations the -- noting that my former argument applies here equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.647" offset="17656818">Our position is of course that no Constitutional privilege exist in the First Amendment now and when should not be recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="4405.095" offset="17694643">I think a point that should be brought out is that even apart from that the arguments in this case is talking about a constitutional privilege focused on a particular test of some showing that the Government must make.</text>
            <text syncTime="4423.945" offset="17770085">Generally, a balancing test, that is exceedingly difficult to apply, a balancing test which is found nowhere with respect to any other personal privileges pertaining to personal relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="4443.648" offset="17848870">Particularly, a distinction is made between serious and less serious crimes between what are called major crimes or victimless crime, I believe that’s how it’s characterized in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4460.120" offset="17914699">A distinction which as far as I can determine is wholly detached from legislative judgment that if Congress is seen fit to make a victimless crime as it’s referred to, that a crime as a matter of determination -- their legislative determination and its constitutional, we see no basis for drawing lines in formulating some constitutional rule which would distinguish between something that is a major crime as opposed to a victimless crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="4500.645" offset="18076867">Also, this rule turns on a showing by the Government that no other sources of information are available.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.124" offset="18110722">But suppose you have an informer who’s unreliable and you want to call a reporter in order to show reliability or suppose the informer is in fact reliable but he would make a bad witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.020" offset="18182297">Is this a situation where we should say that there are no other sources available?</text>
            <text syncTime="4533.720" offset="18209151">And that, what about the whole notion of cumulative evidence and the importance of that and how is a judge to measure whether or not cumulative evidence is or is not important in determining function of the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.881" offset="18273830">I take that this are extremely difficult questions in trying to formulate a test of a nature that’s proposed is as a matter of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.547" offset="18320433">And then moreover, its as Mr. Prettyman has pointed out the balancing test is one that turns on the particular facts of each case, and ad hoc test, which seems to suggest that there would always be a litigable issue involved resulting in a substantial and considerable delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.943" offset="18406010">And that such delays we feel make an important difference when you're talking about the Grand Jury process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4592.292" offset="18443417">Statutes of limitations run, you have problems of questions of speedy trial and determinations of that nature which make a difference, a substantial difference when you're talking about a Grand Jury as opposed to an investigation by a legislative committee where it is looking into the matters which result in legislation and seems that those considerations are important ones when you're trying to formulate some kind of a constitutional test.</text>
            <text syncTime="4628.850" offset="18589703">I will just point out that such delays can be avoided and probably would be avoided under the guidelines of the Attorney General as proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4642.820" offset="18645500">You would not have such litigable interruptions and we think that that is an important distinction between the constitutional proposition that was presented and the guidelines that were spoken of earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="4681.643" offset="18800877">There was a case a few years ago where a camera crew went into a Massachusetts Mental Hospital and agreed in advance to keep in confidence not to publish the actual faces, names of people in their to preserve that confidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.091" offset="18858660">You can imagine a labor leader, who is ill at home and the press is clamoring for an interview and he might say, “Come in, you can set-up your cameras, have an interview, but not in relation to my family.</text>

            <text syncTime="4837.907" offset="19425935">I think there a number of factors, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.413" offset="19431891">In the first place, I think there has been much agreement between prosecutors and newsmen over the years in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="4847.784" offset="19465432">I think that in addition to that that there has been a flood of subpoenas more recently as we get into the problem of minorities and radical groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="4857.786" offset="19505451">We have our reporters today, doing things they never did before.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.942" offset="19517990">Reporters themselves, I used to be one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4864.910" offset="19533873">I would tell you that our reporters today are much more investigative, more sophisticated, more daring.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.614" offset="19552681">Here’s Pappas, he put his life on the line by being inside the headquarters in order to report from the inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.316" offset="19575564">This, I think is of relatively recent origin when combined also with the concept on the part of the prosecutor that here is a man who is on the scene and who could provide an available investigative arm of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4890.822" offset="19637527">All these things have come to the front at a time, at a sudden time just in the way that perhaps in Griswold, the question which you think would go back for 100 years did not arise until that particular --</text>

            <text syncTime="4904.843" offset="19693638">Combination, that’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4906.924" offset="19701997">And as my brother suggested a few minutes ago, here in the course of a year and a half, NBC, CBS, we’re getting four subpoenas a month recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="4917.657" offset="19744942">They didn’t get those counter subpoenas back in the old days, 123 subpoenas between January of 1969 and July of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.764" offset="19773363">And if this Court affirms this case, I can assure you that reporters will be spending a lot more time in Grand Juries and in courtrooms than they are in reporting from now on.</text>

            <text syncTime="4945.329" offset="19855597">Suppose on going into the headquarters, the reporter was horrified to find as I am sure you would horrified if he found what I’m about to suggest, a great arsenal that had 20 flame throwers, 50 machine guns, whole stack of automatic riffles, cases and boxes full of dynamite for making bombs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4973.830" offset="19969595">Your test would mean that he would have his lips sealed and he cannot tell that to the Grand Jury investigating this whole problem of potential disorder and civil disturbance?</text>
