            <text syncTime="23.472" offset="167565">This case is here by a writ of certiorari to review a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which affirmed the finding of the District Court that it had consistent with the standards of 10 (b) (3) of the Military Selective Service Act of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.738" offset="236633">No jurisdiction to review actions of the Selective Service System which removed a conscientious objector classification, given to petitioner by his local Board and I should alert the Court at the outset to the fact that since the briefing in this case on September 28 of this year, Congress has enacted a new statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.303" offset="322941">You will find only cursory reference in our reply brief filed on Friday of the week just passed to that statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="150.285" offset="674863">Two of those standards are of prominence in this case because in effect it is the enshrining by Congress of the due process arguments which we have made in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.519" offset="719793">I will read those two, they are brief: “Each registrant shall be afforded the opportunity to appear in person before the Local or any Appeal Board of the Selective Service System to testify and present evidence regarding his status.”</text>
            <text syncTime="178.962" offset="789488">And the second applicable regulation that is statutory provision, “in the event of a decision, adverse to the claim of a registrant, the Local or Appeal Board in making such decision shall upon request, furnish each registrant a brief written statement of the reasons for its decision.”</text>

            <text syncTime="297.244" offset="1262618">I would say that it ripened at the moment when he wrote to his Board, although it is quite clear and his application makes quite clear in terms of the length of time that it took him to get to that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.584" offset="1316012">I would say that the day you would fix it would be the day when he makes that day in 1967, when he wrote to his Board saying my claim has matured and history of the registrant in this regard is quite pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.282" offset="1378811">The registrant has and reflected in the CO application, a traditional Lutheran background.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.258" offset="1486749">I am sorry I do not know that, but the petitioner does not rely on a particular sect that he or his family may have been a member on.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.567" offset="1527917">In coming to his conscientious objector position, he refers to early training by his parents, early and attentive training by his parents in the Church tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.628" offset="1572221">He refers to his matriculation (Inaudible) College to his activity in the civil rights movement and finally to the vocation of Medicine which for him reflected a vocational method of acting out of his views with regard to non-violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.326" offset="1642961">His application in response to the question; do you believe in the Supreme Being, was answered in affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.460" offset="1671486">In addition to the strict religious basis for his application however, he referred to a broader moral standard, he believes that man believed, the members in the community among men and then one cannot take right under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.780" offset="1732822">It is certainly clear, although I do not think it is an issue in this case because the posture of this case at this moment as I understand it is that there is no question about the propriety of his classification of processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.535" offset="1787784">What we are here doing is attacking an appellate regulatory procedure which is riven with due process violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.161" offset="1822370">The application which he filed with Board, however, between September and November of 1967, was supported by reference letters from regiment, from the Dean of the Medical School, from colleagues and from friends, all of them are testing for two things; first to his sincerity and second to the nature of his belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.885" offset="1921217">In November of 1967, Fein appeared, when interviewed before his Local Board, at that interview, he was canvassed, rather carefully in detail as what his reference letters with regard to the nature of his religious belief and to whether he would perform alternative service that is alternative non-combatant service.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.592" offset="2012019">Fein unequivocally took the position at that time that he would perform any work in the national interest, any where in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.177" offset="2042425">He expressed the hope that he might use his capacity as physician to aid in some activity preferably in a ghetto constituted area and in addition parenthetically, he said, my wife is a physician and if we could find a place to work together that would please us, but is not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.995" offset="2113687">He was then asked about the nature of his religious belief and unequivocally asserted a belief stated in both traditional Supreme Being, Pre-Seega (ph) and in Seega -- I suppose what we would now call (Inaudible) in Seega terms, relying on the moral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.698" offset="2184427">The Board in response to the II-A classification which the registrant then held said, “we will not find you a conscientious objector at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.205" offset="2238553">We will retain you in your II-A classification” and it said, “we will give a right to appeal when and if the moment ever comes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="549.540" offset="2271885">Well, that moment did come.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.272" offset="2278781">In February of 1968, the registrant was re-classified I-A from his II-A classification and in timely fashion, he asked his Board for another personal interview.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.055" offset="2321935">The Board granted that interview on May 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.734" offset="2336669">In anticipation of that interview, the registrant filed with the Board a series of answers to questions which appear to be troubling the Board at its earlier November interview, particularly those with regard to the position of a Lutheran Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.249" offset="2414722">You will find that I believe annexed to the government’s brief at page, I do not have the citation, I am sorry, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.723" offset="2476580">The substance of the second meeting before the Local Board was similar to that of the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.328" offset="2498941">They asked if he would perform an alternative service and he said, of course I would.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.194" offset="2514406">They asked the nature of his religious belief and series of other questions which he apparently answered satisfactory because his Board on that day, May 22, 1968, gave him his conscientious objector classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.215" offset="2566546">Ten days later, the State Director appealed to the New York State Appeal Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.217" offset="2594549">Procedurally, what the State Director did was to notify, not the registrant of that fact, but notified the Appeal Board and the Local Board and it is the Local Board which in turn notifies the registrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.619" offset="2644182">As soon as the registrant became aware that there was an appeal taken, after a finding by this linchpin of the Selective Service System, the Local Board, that's phenomena which is your friends and neighbors, your community, a theory of none of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.140" offset="2714190">The registrant wrote to the Appeal Board and said I do not understand this and I now bewildered and surprised, but I would like an opportunity to get a statement of reasons from the State Director or from the Appeal Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.558" offset="2763927">I do not know what it is that he has in mind when he in effect reverses, or appeals from a finding of I-0 classification, no pertinent response to that letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.808" offset="2804887">Secondly, registrant inquires of the Appeal Board, what are the issues?</text>
            <text syncTime="691.719" offset="2840518">What are the reasons?</text>
            <text syncTime="693.539" offset="2847833">No pertinent response from the Appeal Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.032" offset="2861834">Registrant then says, I like a chance to appear before the Appeal Board or at least to rebut somehow issues which are in the dark.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.756" offset="2896734">No pertinent response except for a minute of action, dated in July which in effect revoked his conscientious objector classification by unanimous vote and returned him to a I-A classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.925" offset="2953367">Now, by Selective Service Regulation, a registrant has no right to appeal to the Presidential Appeal Board unless there has been a dissent below.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.043" offset="2993805">The registrant nevertheless wrote to the then Selective Service, Director General Hershey and described his case and asked the good offices of General Hershey in asking the Appeal Board to review his case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1175.011" offset="4773684">Then I suggest, this is clearly within the Oestereich decision by statute, when a Local Board, it is a registrant conscientious objector status on statute that is final, unless an appeal is authorized by rules and regulations and here if you refer back to that appellant regulatory scheme, you will find no authorization except the generality, which describes just rules and regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1233.350" offset="5007114">What it says is pursuant to such rules and regulations as the President may prescribe and then it creates the standards, but nowhere in the 1967 Act are there any standards which are authorized by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.710" offset="5056538">So I believe that we are in a classic Oestereich situation with regard to the burden of the government’s argument which has been that there really is burden here of question classification of processing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.134" offset="5114216">I notice that the Solicitor General finally at page 13 of his brief agrees that this Court supports our position.</text>

            <text syncTime="1279.226" offset="5190598">I would point that parenthetically that while we are not asking the Court to deal with question of classification, but the government seems to suggest, although its silent as to reason that there was no prima facie case made out here or conscientious objector classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.650" offset="5264264">Now, maybe there is something that I do not know about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.340" offset="5275026">Maybe, although it does not appear on the record, the record is silent in this regard, the government has unequivocally taken the position that there was no statement given by the State Director to the Appeal Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.715" offset="5320584">If that is so, I do not understand how it can, as it does in this Court, can test the validity of the CO classification.</text>

            <text syncTime="1324.364" offset="5371157">That is precisely why the Due Process Standards we are urging here are as important as we feel they are.</text>

            <text syncTime="1335.792" offset="5416819">Here we had a Local Board, having come to a conclusion that a registrant was classifiable as I-0.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.846" offset="5469064">I would suggest the Court that it either do one of two things; that it apply the New Public Law 92-129, follow the standards there set in, refer this back to Selective Service System for review in light of those standards, that pending that the District Court reinstate finding his I-O classification, that is number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.809" offset="5576897">Alternatively, although the relief we believe should be the same that it apply the standards that it has recited as the laws in Oestereich and Breen to 10 (b) (3) of the Act, that it understand that we attacking a system of classification, not classification itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1876.928" offset="7581429">This case can become quite complicated and I am going to try if I can to present it in a somewhat simple form insofar as there is a constitutional question in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.428" offset="7659379">It seems to me to be essentially one of the framework within which this Court sits, that is the separation of powers, the proper function of this Court with respect to the functions of specifically Congress in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.291" offset="7742866">The case I believe turns on the application of two relatively simple statutory provisions which are quoted on pages 2 and 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.910" offset="7801276">First is the jurisdictional amount provision to which Mr. Standard referred at the close of his argument and which is discussed at the close of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.159" offset="7854357">The District Court shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions wherein the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.602" offset="7912140">Now, there is not trace of evidence in this case that $10,000.00 or any other amount is involved and the argument made by Mr. Standard in his brief is in essence that that provision really should not be taken seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.552" offset="7987895">Maybe it is unconstitutional, though he was not willing to say that it was unconstitutional this morning that at any rate at 19th Century anachronism and the Court shouldn't really pay much attention to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2071.737" offset="8360610">In that case, the majority of the Court claimed, (Voice Overlap) they made it clear that it was not proceeding under this Section because it felt that the jurisdictional amount could not be there and it found a way to proceed under another Section which is not available here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.965" offset="8425498">So I think that the Hague case rather supports the position I am taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.105" offset="8446082">I would not want to be misunderstood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.940" offset="8457472">if I were a member of Congress which I am not, it seems to me that this provision might will be reconsidered with respect to cases of this type, but it is what Congress has provided and Congress has not made any change in it and I find it difficult to see why the Court should not respect it and carry it into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.937" offset="8545452">Now, the other statutory provision is Section 10 (b) (3) of the Selective Service Act which has been before this Court in a number of cases and which is quoted at the bottom of page 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.768" offset="8612744">No judicial review shall be made of the classification and here I emphasize the next two words “or processing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.943" offset="8653495">Mr. Standard has said he is talking about the procedures used here and I suggest that “or processing” could not be clearer expression of the intention of Congress that the procedures shall not be subject to judicial review of any registrant by Local Board, the Appeal Board or the President except as a defense to criminal prosecution after the registrant has responded either affirmatively or negatively to an order to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.627" offset="8808140">The question in this case it seems to us is really the construction and application of Section 10 (b) (3) and let me point out too that the ultimate question is simply one of timing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.911" offset="8885357">If Mr. Standards has substantial questions to raise on behalf of his client, we do not contend that there is not a place where they can be raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.148" offset="8926317">We are not contending that these questions are forever foreclosed from judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.773" offset="8948783">Our position is simply that they cannot consistently with the enactment by Congress, an enactment properly made by Congress in its judgment, both with respect to its power to control the procedures in the Lower Federal Courts and with respect to its powers to raise and maintain armies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.171" offset="9042406">That Congress has provided that no judicial review shall be had of the classification or processes except after either an affirmative or negative response to an order to report for induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.281" offset="9114817">Now obviously of course this turns on several cases which have recently been before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.805" offset="9148881">The first of which and the one I suppose most relied on by Mr. Standard is the Oestereich case and I would point out that that case is markedly different from this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.484" offset="9187646">I would point out too that Justice Stewart wrote a dissenting opinion in that case in which Justices Brennan and White concurred, in which they said that there was no inherent or inevitable conflict between the statutory provisions which were before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.982" offset="9325573">The position which was taken by the government there was that 10 (b) (3) said no judicial review shall be had, but there was another provision in the statute which said the students of theology “shall be exempt from training and service under this Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.126" offset="9414180">And then they struggled in my mind which went on in connection with that case, I found those two provisions, though not necessarily, inherently inconsistent, so close to inconsistent that I found it impossible to support the literal construction of Section 10 (b) (3) in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.261" offset="9518775">The then Director of the Selective Service System was unhappy about that and he may well have been more farseeing to see cases such as this over the horizon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.090" offset="9581991">I recognized that the conflict was not absolute or literal as was pointed out by Mr. Justice Stewart’s opinion, but I ascertained that if this case went forward, that the criminal division of Department of Justice would not institute a criminal prosecution against the man where the statute provided that he shall be exempt from service or training under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.329" offset="9699020">It was perfectly clear in my mind that if one, if such a prosecution that were instituted and if that is true to the Solicitor General’s Office, that I would confess there in such case and I had little doubt with the Court would support such a confession in view of the express provision of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.625" offset="9780208">And referring to an opinion of this Court in a grab case some 20 years ago where it was said that it was unnecessary to walk-up the hill then march down again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.555" offset="9831931">I felt that the conflict was so close that a construction of Section 10 (b) (3) was called upon and I point out that that problem arose only because there were two statutory provisions, at least nearly in conflict with each other, there is nothing of that sort here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2515.486" offset="10135578">Now on the same day, that Oestereich was decided, there was also decided Clark against Gabriel which it seems to me clearly supports the position that I have taken that Oestereich turns on the clash on the presence of two virtually inconsistent provisions, shall I say practically inconsistent provisions with respect, that I fully agree they were not literally inconsistent, that I felt that they were practically so and the majority of the Court and took that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.759" offset="10272669">Clark against Gabriel involved a pre-induction effort to enjoin inductions with respect to a claim of conscientious objector and the Court held that 10 (b) (3) barred that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.602" offset="10344140">I might also point out in the Oestereich case itself, Mr. Justice Harlan concurs in the judgment on ground which are very close to the position of Mr. Standard today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.000" offset="10397638">I think perhaps over simplifying it, it was on the ground that if it was a question of fact, there couldn't be an injunction, but if there was a question of law, it could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.025" offset="10445808">But that view, so he repeated it in the Gutknecht and Breen or particularly the Breen case, was not adopted by any other member of the Court and then the case which I think is the closest to this case, was decided only a few week later than Clark against Gabriel and that is Boyd against Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.902" offset="10553328">That is a per curiam opinion of the Court, two to three lines long, bypassing the jurisdictional amount question, but otherwise simply affirming the judgment of the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.538" offset="10615813">But Boyd against Clark was a pure question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.728" offset="10632636">There was a question and it was suggested there for enjoining inductions that there was unconstitutional discrimination against non-college students in that they perhaps because of inadequate financial support were subjected to the draft while college students were deferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.977" offset="10729602">That contention was denied by a three-judge District Court which also dismissed for want of jurisdiction on the jurisdictional amount question.</text>

            <text syncTime="3421.736" offset="13760642">Well, I take it that the effect of the appeal does indicate that somebody thinks that it ought to be looked into.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.141" offset="13782272">I may say it does not necessarily mean that they wanted to reverse in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.400" offset="13803274">After mystifying laws in the State Appeal Board, he lost unanimously and under the regulation he had no right to appeal to the Presidential Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.106" offset="13846115">He wrote to the Director of Selective Service and the Director Selective Service took an appeal for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.171" offset="13874327">I have no reason to believe that the Director of Selective Service thought that it ought to be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.681" offset="13904420">He apparently thought that it ought to be reviewed and it seems to me entirely appropriate for the administrative officer and say to the tribunal and we think this is a matter which ought to be reviewed without putting any weight as to which way it ought to go and I think that that is juxtaposition here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.820" offset="13984982">In any event, it is a part of the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.642" offset="14000237">It is a part of processing of the registrant’s case and that is precisely what Section 10 (b) (3) says that it should not be subject to a judicial review and we submit that is in effect what this Court decided in Boyd against Clark and that this is fully consistent with the Court’s decisions in Oestereich and Breen.</text>
