            <text syncTime="25.288" offset="174880">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.333" offset="199017">The Chief Judge of the North Carolina Court of Appeals, Judge Raymond Mallard makes a comment frequently, has to me, that every case that he sees in his court has a hooker in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.429" offset="247396">While I was noting the previous argument and this one has to do with a transcript, but it has a little bit different twist to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.428" offset="283445">In this case, different from the previous case, the defendant, there is no question about his indigency now or then.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.248" offset="330674">He is now in state prison, a young man who, I do not think there is any question ever raised by anybody, that he was absolutely indigenous.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.307" offset="390861">He was tried in a trial beginning on November 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.758" offset="416670">He was not convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.823" offset="424924">The jury verdict was never reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.970" offset="441538">There was a mistrial order and the defendant was then set down for trial again.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.876" offset="473198">Prior to the second trial, very shortly after the first trial a motion was filed for a transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.843" offset="509038">You will find the order of mistrial on page 11 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.642" offset="528265">The affidavit -- on the bottom of that page it has motion for transcript which of course obviously is an affidavit in which the defendant signed an affidavit that he was indigent, that I had advised him that a transcript would be a great help and that it would be available if we could afford to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.849" offset="621052">The motion was made on that affidavit which was summarily denied by Judge Fountain (ph) who is a very fine and gracious Judge and very gifted Judge, but he and I disagreed on this but it was a matter of fact without argument denied to which the defendant accepted and this is the crux of our case of whether or not the defendant was entitled to a transcript of the evidentiary portion of the trial which commenced on November 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.330" offset="763053">The mistrial was ordered on November 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.097" offset="782070">The trial -- the jury had commenced its deliberation at 9:30 on that morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.106" offset="806103">There where three days of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.786" offset="816865">Now, a question has been raised in the previous case about whether or not counsel could reconstruct.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.351" offset="847063">Well, there again we have a peculiar situation here in which we do not need to have the reconstruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.427" offset="875380">That was to probably done for purposes of an appeal, but for purposes of preparation and cross examination of the second trial this we thought was absolutely essential.</text>

            <text syncTime="231.693" offset="1000454">I used my own recollection in trying to investigate what had been brought out in the first trial and I do not know that I made many errors in them, but it would have still been most helpful.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.114" offset="1182162">In this particular case, the young defendant, I say young, 20-21 years old and it might that young, was charged with beating his girlfriend's grandmother to death with a frying pan in an effort to rob her of her worldly possessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.934" offset="1273381">Now, whether or not he is guilty is not a matter that is before this Court or was never subject of my determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.256" offset="1298668">I was appointed to represent him and I hope I did the best job that I could possibly do, but be that as it maybe, I do not think that I did the best job that I could have possibly done had I had that transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.451" offset="1359481">It is difficult to argue this matter in this Court and try to put this Court back in the courtroom in Craven County, New Bern, North Carolina, where the fine Judge, where the good court, the courtrooms are fine place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.584" offset="1424056">There is one witness who was the primary witness for the state, a Captain T. M. Brucher (ph) of New Bern Police Department.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.743" offset="1532621">Yet he testified that he had spent one hour-and-a-half at the scene, but if you will read the testimony as elicited in the second trial, you will find that he did not account for more than five minutes of his time list.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.087" offset="1598031">He said that he was at the funeral home for an hour-and-a-half, yet he had made no notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.667" offset="1624363">He said -- he testified with respect to the arrest of the defendant without a warrant, his incarceration without a warrant, without being taken before a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.671" offset="1668353">He testified about taking him out of jail and taking him back to the detective division of the Police Department and questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.898" offset="1705238">Oh! Yes he testified that he calls under the Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.382" offset="1723210">He testified further about the statements made to him, but no where in this whole procedure had he ever filed a first note with his supervisor, where had he made the first note for his records.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.808" offset="1780888">We could not have ask to examine the notes that he had made under the Jinks rule, we could not have done anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="1146.706" offset="4660523">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.613" offset="4672121">We want very strenuously to divorce this case from the one this Court has just heard because we are in a Court far the situation with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.647" offset="4708274">The North Carolina system I am very proud off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.254" offset="4718723">We do have trial de novo even for the petty offenses or misdemeanor and in event those cases are appealed nor collaterally attacked by certiorari or by habeas corpus, file temporary out, a transcript would be available and the merits of statement that our appellate courts require would be coming, forth coming from that transcript which would be made available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.119" offset="4802106">So we are certainly not talking about cases that I said, this Court has -- as I read your decision previously decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.236" offset="4830632">Here we are talking about a direct attack, we talking about direct appeal, we are talking about a collateral attack on habeas corpus with the question of transcript being made available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.190" offset="4870443">Rather we are talking about the mistrial situation which can be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.789" offset="4892803">We are talking about mistrial situation which as the Court has already pointed out can be extended not only in the mistrial application but in preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.231" offset="4930629">As Your Honors pointed out, a rich could hire a reporter to come in and take the transcript and could make that available to himself on his trial, he could thereby impeach the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.108" offset="4978067">We are talking also about the trial de novo situation which we have in North Carolina and in many other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.749" offset="5000637">A rich man again could hire reporter to come on his traffic offense and hear the testimony there and have that reporter available at his appeal in Superior Court to again to try to impeach the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.428" offset="5047344">So we are talking about an application that is far divorced from the previous decisions of this Court and we are talking about an application that could be very sweepy and it go not only to this mistrial situation of which hopefully there are limited number, but could go to the preliminary hearing or to any other trial or any other kind of testimony by witness who comes on at the trial with final result from a conviction and we would emphasize that fact to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.825" offset="5152983">We have also in this case no indication that counsel did try to contact the Court reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.314" offset="5174926">We note that the appendix shows that the motion for the transcript whether actually presented to the Court at that time or not was dated the 25 November and the man was not tried until mid December and so counsel knew what he was going to do on the 25 November at least in making his motion for a transcript and there is no evidence that he made any efforts to get up with the Court reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.507" offset="5267713">He says, the reporter would have told him what was in that transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.360" offset="5279102">He could have made notes himself and then again the reporter was available and is on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.673" offset="5300418">He found from his notes that there were some discrepancies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.867" offset="5313166">He could have asked those questions of the Court reporter and brought the Court reporter on to impeach the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.908" offset="5337303">As it was, he had of course available to him the fact that this Captain Brucher had made no notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.179" offset="5358410">He pointed that out to the Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.998" offset="5365724">He pointed out to the jury that the alleged confession was never reduced to writing, again calling into question the credibility of that witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.622" offset="5400206">In fact we think that he had available to him all of the things which the jury could see that would impeach the credibility of this witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.033" offset="5441793">We think rather, we got a case where although there are some alleged discrepancies in the testimony and we do not know what those discrepancies actually were, they are not important to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.734" offset="5484634">We are talking about the difference between questioning a witness 30 or 45 minutes and an hour and a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.707" offset="5512532">We do not think that is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.589" offset="5520056">We are talking about whether or not he made some comments at the first trial about the defendant’s clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.249" offset="5538655">Again, that cannot be important.</text>

            <text syncTime="1371.708" offset="5560493">Was it the officer Dody who was present at the present the second time the defendant confessed and testified about that or was it accompanied by through himself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1475.755" offset="5976676">In short, we think that the alleged discrepancies here and counsel will admit that he cannot take for sure what those discrepancies are, are not important discrepancies in this case and for the Court to use this case as a step to take a very giant step who can make transcripts available to defendants, we think would be serious miscarriage of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.454" offset="6063507">As the Court has pointed out, we think that this would put a premium a mistrial, not only of course do the disagreeing jurors cause mistrials, but the conduct of a defendant or of some witness or even if some police officer, as we had in our state where the policeman will put defendants in handcuffs in view of the jury or some such things can cause a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.567" offset="6151905">If the defendant has some key testimony and his attorney has not known about it before and he does not like what his attorney does and (Inaudible) by a way of cross examination of that witness, we think it would put a premium on the mistrial situation for him to cause a mistrial knowing that he could get a free transcript from the State and have that available for his attorney on the next trial to better cross examine the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.154" offset="6242289">So we fear that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.364" offset="6251171">We fear also of course the overburdening of our Trial Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.601" offset="6268098">We make transcripts available when the defendant is directly appealing on collateral, they are attacking his conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1557.254" offset="6302684">In North Carolina we have done that voluntarily on the smallest offense, but to recall the Court authority to delay the activities, the Court to delay the preparation of transcripts for direct appeals, in order to prepare the transcripts of the mistrials was again caused the delay in the Court system which seriously overburdened the reporting of our own state courts and those of other State and the Federal Courts with them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.484" offset="7123661">Well, yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.589" offset="7128049">Practically I think the time for doing that would be before the defendant rested this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.776" offset="7148738">The Court of course gives him time to get ready to make his presentation and at that point I think he could have searched his memory for any discrepancy he thought there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.997" offset="7189698">The Court reporter was there at that time and could have asked for a recess and taken two years the time for this Court, certainly is far in a way grater delay than the one they might have been occasioned by getting the Court reporter to search his notes and although I cannot say this to the Court with certainty, I am very certain the Court would have allow him that delay, if he told the Court that he thought there were discrepancies and he wanted to see what the reporter might show.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.659" offset="7312369">We think there is been an absence by the defendants of any showing for special need in this case and at the very least if the Court is going to say transcript should be available, we think that that ought to be restricted to those cases where there is some sort of showing the need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.361" offset="7371092">For that reason, we would ask the Court not to extend the doctrine on transcript and to say that in the case of mistrials, they remain in all of this, they are not important for that objectively, they are not important for these reasons unless there is some special need in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.871" offset="7429189">Thank you.</text>
