            <label>Mr. Bill J.Cornelius</label>
            <text syncTime="41.397" offset="239257">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.238" offset="246676">Mr. Chief justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.662" offset="264334">This case involves a judgment canceling a note and for $20,000 damages recovered on the merits by the petitioner T.R. Grubbs in United States District Court against General Electric Credit Corporation, after the case had been removed from the United States Court, from State Court to United States government which was the party throughout the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.561" offset="371959">The Court of Appeals held that the case was improperly removed and ordered that it would be remanded to the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.310" offset="402888">We on certiorari are asking this honorable court to reverse the ruling of the Court of Appeal and sustain the jurisdiction of the United States District Court which rendered its judgment on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.010" offset="457745">The case arose in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.803" offset="468925">It was originally filed by General Electric Credit Corporation in State Court against T.R.Grubbs who is a small businessman in Jefferson, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.190" offset="510408">The case was filed on simple note, to collect a promissory note.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.848" offset="541128">When the case was filed in State Court, the petitioner Grubbs answered on the merits, claiming the invalidity of the promissory note and also filed a cross action against General Electric Credit Corporation and the General Electric company, alleging that these two companies had conspired together in an unlawful attempt which was successful to destroy his business by torturous and wrongful conduct in violation of both the State and the Federal Antitrust Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.207" offset="682503">The petitioner Grubbs then amended his pleadings and brought in the United States Government in order to determine the priority of various liens being claimed against the petitioner by the government and other parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.178" offset="746450">When the government was brought into the case and State Court, it filed a petition for removal and the case was removed without objection or without motion to remand on the part of any party.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.050" offset="801934">In United States Court after removal, the United States government filed an answer claiming that its lien was indeed prior to the other liens being asserted against Mr. Grubbs, and the government also filed a cross action against General Electric Credit Corporation and the General Electric company, alleging that they had conspired together to injure and destroy the petitioner Grubb's business and thereby had tortuously interfered and not only with the petitioner's business but with the interest of the government, its lien which it had on the asset of Grubbs.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.471" offset="975596">No party objected to removal.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.726" offset="1092625">We had not briefed the question carefully and we were at that time under the impression that the State Court could not construe the Federal Antitrust Laws, but could enforce them concurrently with Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.126" offset="1138183">We later discovered that, that was incorrect.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.060" offset="1289902">The United States government asserted affirmative release in tort against GECC and GE as we were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.419" offset="1323338">GE and GECC filed a number of amended pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.596" offset="1348103">They consented fully to the jurisdiction of the Court and after being in the Federal Court, for a year and eight months, trial was held on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.230" offset="1458653">In the judgment on the merits, the General Electric Company was absorbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.963" offset="1493552">The United States government was denied relief, and the petitioner Grubbs recovered judgment of $20,000 in damages against General Electric Credit Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.885" offset="1545275">So the appeal has been by General Electric Credit Corporation in the absence of the other parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.891" offset="1573278">But, I would like to make clear that in the trial on the merits, all these parties were active participants in the trial, filed amended pleadings, filed motions for continuances, participated in pre-trial, hearings and pre-trial orders, and everyone of them made motions to the Court for judgment on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2368.670" offset="9548357">But, even though as I am getting it, I do find that some of the cases are highly confusing because all of them seem to have -- for instance we did not move onto trial on the plea when we filed in the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.426" offset="9603423">It's true, we did some actions in the Federal Court, but we never amended our petition, the first provisionary petition was the only petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.184" offset="9642398">That's what that's cast in state court for –-</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.269" offset="9654728">That's what that does in attempt to say any jurisdiction evolves in the Federal court, it would just not in any.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.243" offset="9682627">Now we did file responsive pleas to these cross-actions against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.580" offset="9699972">We had some in the State Court and in the Federal Court, well for the first time the United States government took the (Inaudible), and we answered and sought full trails, I recall those answers were amended to bring them down to date because a more definite statement was subsequently filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.764" offset="9784713">But, it was in the State Court until the government got in to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.590" offset="9800073">Now, it's just as simple as that, the government probably could remove, did remove; we thought they could remove and didn't object.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.595" offset="9840093">I think that it's true that the Court of Appeals did not discuss that banks case and those cases that are cited -- the Uinta case, but in each and everyone of those cases that I could see, there were considerable elements of amended pleading and sort of a new ball game started over in the Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.335" offset="9930999">I don't know why that Court of Appeals didn't ask them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.394" offset="9943224">I saw Judge Goldberg lost that day I wanted to ask him but I figured may I better -- I may have to ask him about the (Inaudible) case someday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.932" offset="9973422">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2550.655" offset="10276338">We take the position that these acts are prohibited by the United States Antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.648" offset="10304236">The cross-action was brought under those laws, and while the court did not conclude that we have proven our conspiracy between GE and GECC, the court did find and filed an extensive Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law indicating that there was suspicious circumstances and indications of a conspiracy between GE and GECC.</text>
