            <text syncTime="18.882" offset="149177">This case raises once again the issue first raised and decided by this Court 15 years ago in Griffin versus Illinois of whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires that a State which provides appeals of right and reporters who transcribe trials provide a poor person who is unable to pay for that transcript and who needs that transcript to demonstrate crucial trial errors so that he may have an adequate and effective review and may adequately exercise his right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.997" offset="317719">This case today arises under Illinois Supreme Court rule 607 which at the time of trial and until very recently provided that only defendants in felony cases had, indigent defendants, had a right to apply for free transcript from the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.331" offset="411028">As of July 1st of this year that rule has been amended so that it now provides that any defendant who at the time of trial faced a penalty greater than six months in jail could apply to Illinois for a transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="1927.530" offset="7783828">The issues as the City of Chicago sees them in this case are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.883" offset="7801173">First, should rule of Griffin versus Illinois and Williams versus Oklahoma City be extended to afford free transcripts to indigent for appealing cases involving convictions of what are generally recognized as merely of petty offenses and secondly, does the classification between serious and petty violate the Fourteenth Amendment in a fashion which this Court has considered in the past in another cases to be invidious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.057" offset="7921859">We believe that both these questions ought to be answer in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.261" offset="7938682">This Court in Boddie versus Connecticut has recently noted that Griffin rule has had a sturdy growth and I submit that the growth was noticed greatly by the fact that each subsequent application of the rule in Griffin has been based upon a fact situation which found; one, personal liberty of the petitioner in jeopardy and or upon two; the invidious exclusionary consequences of the particular appellate practice as it was applied to an indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.979" offset="8065637">Neither of these threshold conditions exists in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.195" offset="8082460">Appellant here is not faced with the prospect of incarceration because he was charged with an ordinance violation for which the only sanction was a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.026" offset="8121748">And secondly the appellant himself has cavalierly ignored alternate available avenues to perfect his appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.921" offset="8165320">Mayer's Illinois Supreme Court appeal of the lower Court jury conviction has been docketed and is awaiting to disposition of this question in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.540" offset="8219864">He is not therefore in the posture of Williams versus Oklahoma City and your decision in that case ought not to be considered as controlling.</text>
