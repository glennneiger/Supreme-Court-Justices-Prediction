            <text syncTime="40.817" offset="236938">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.703" offset="252507">The matter comes before you today in a writ of Certiorari directed to the Fifth Circuit in connection with its having reversed a summary judgment granted to petitioner who was the defendant in the District Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.817" offset="320948">The summary judgment came about as a result of a petition being filed by plaintiff wherein he alleged himself to be a special service employee of an independent contractor, Otis Engineering Company, doing work on as he alleged a fixed and immobile drilling rig off the coast of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.785" offset="428781">He alleged in his complaint that the accident occurred December 17, 1965 and the complaint in connection with that alleged accident was filled with the clerk on January 4, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.369" offset="503178">In the complaint, the plaintiff sought relief in the basic tort action alleging recovery under the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.506" offset="567648">Routine discovery transpired and ultimately it was conclusively shown that this was a fixed and immobile structure, an artificial island in which this alleged accident was supposed to have occurred and as result of that, petitioner filed his motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.209" offset="650509">It was argued before the Court and the District Judge in furtherance of the recent opinion by this Court in Rodrigue held as a matter of law that Chevron was entitled to its judgment because the application of the laws of Louisiana to this tort action were that the plaintiff was compelled to file a suit within a one year period of time and not having done so, the matter had prescribed on time barred as in the other states we use the time of prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.376" offset="799198">An appeal was sought by respondent to the Fifth Circuit and the Fifth Circuit in deciding the case, notwithstanding the very positive position taken by this Court in Rodrigue that the admiralty and maritime law did not apply to fixed and immobile structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.826" offset="881013">The Fifth Circuit went on to follow its earlier decision in this Pure Oil versus Snipes case and held that, yes, admiralty and maritime law did apply and since it did apply then the admiralty and maritime doctrine of laches was applicable and summarily reversed the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.412" offset="1191348">All that Rodrigue said was that this Court was satisfied that Congress in having passed the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act was paramountly interested and the men themselves being closely connected to the adjacent states in which they were working and this Court recognized that Congress held the admiralty and maritime law doctrine of laches otherwise would not apply to fixed and artificial island such as this.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lloyd Cyril Melancon</label>
            <text syncTime="381.882" offset="1601157">That is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.331" offset="1610979">And the Fifth Circuit went on in its decision in Huson below to take a distinction between substantive and procedural law and, of course, with the background of the Pure Oil versus Snipes case where of course it was very contrary holding to this Court's holding in Rodrigue justified the exception here and you had a real hideous so to speak because here in Huson we have a personal injury, the man was not killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.869" offset="1745144">In Rodrigue, Doupree, the companion case is you have death cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.006" offset="1761653">Now, this Court says in a death situation, the laws Of Louisiana apply, therefore, the survivors have one year within which to file their claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.057" offset="1809927">Look at the situation you have now, if the Fifth Circuit is to be maintained in its contrary opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.395" offset="1835214">If a man is injured offshore and he lingers more than 12 months and then subsequently dies without having filed the claim or his survivors, he is barred under Rodrigue, yet, in a personal injury action if this Court maintains the Fifth Circuit, the individual who lives may file this lawsuit at anytime in the distant future as long as he can show that there is excusable neglect on his part and that the defendant was not prejudiced by his delays.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.206" offset="1974499">It is a totally inconsistent position Your Honor and the bar in Louisiana where the greatest number of this cases are pending and have been tried, having been looking to this Court for some resolution of this problem that has arisen in the Outer Continental Shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.255" offset="2038656">We thought that had been reached in Rodrigue where this Court specifically stated under no unequivocal terms, otherwise, it said admiralty law does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.379" offset="2079198">The laws of Louisiana shall apply and those laws are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.647" offset="2100305">Now, I might mention to the Court in this connection that since the decision of Rodrigue and the Huson decision, the District Court in Baton Rouge which is also in the Eastern District Louisiana in the Guillory case wrote a very scholarly opinion holding quite squarely on this question of prescription that the one you applied that this is what the Supreme Court said in Rodrigue and just last month in fact with in the last three weeks another panel of the Fifth Circuit headed by Justices Tuttle, Wisdom and Ingram in the Dickerson case have specifically held following this Court in Rodrigue that the laws of Louisiana shall apply to these accidents occurring on fixed structures and then narrowly went on to apply the law but they held multiple faces of the Louisiana law to apply such as the question proximate cause, the calculation of damage, the application of contributory negligence, all of these faces that the Fifth Circuit seemed to be so concerned about as to having equality and uniformity of decision, yet, here is another panel of the Fifth Circuit saying specifically Rodrigue is the law, we recognize it is the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.953" offset="2429447">And in connection -- the question of prescription was not raised therein, but the Court did go on, Judge Tuttle went on, who was the organ of the court in his opinion, to observe that while he was not taking issue with the other panel which raised this fine distinction of substantive procedural law but he recognized that this matter was up before the Supreme Court on writs for ultimate decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="635.108" offset="2614081">No, it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.817" offset="2616902">It is simply this; in Louisiana, the Tort Article of 2315 is the Article under which an offense can be asserted in Court and recovery sought in the tort action.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.718" offset="2676566">In 2315, the legislature went on to state that where a death occurs and this was with respect to the survival of (Inaudible) that these survivors must, within one year, bring their action under 2315.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.597" offset="2740096">However, in a pure personal injury case, the code law article is Civil Code Article of 3536 as applicable thereto, and that is specifically one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.424" offset="2787325">And what happened in the court below that is in the Court of Appeals, the Fifth Circuit went on to take as I said before, a distinction between the substantive law of 2315, which it said was absolutely corrective etcetera with respect to a death action, but then went on to say well now 3536 is procedural, and therefore, being procedural we are not going to apply the admiralty and maritime law doctrine of laches, which is of course inconsistent with what had happened in Rodrigue.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.711" offset="2928491">Now, going back to this question of applications of laws, certainly on the Erie versus Tompkins where we have forum applying the federal law, the law outside of the United States, assuming that -- outside of the State of Louisiana, assuming Mr. B outside of Louisiana, it must of course apply a federal law, but the law of the forum with respect to prescription that the procedural aspects would be applied and here it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.383" offset="3067253">There is not dispute that 3536 limits a personal injury action to one year and that is precisely what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.348" offset="3099018">Now, there is nothing unique or new about the fact that a tort action must be brought in one year in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.968" offset="3133500">This goes back for a hundred years to the old code.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.644" offset="3148233">Anyone practicing in Louisiana is well aware that this is nothing new or different to something brought along.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.024" offset="3169758">I mentioned before, our state compensations statutes, specifically limits the right of recovery and the compensation to one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.172" offset="3202358">The Longshoreman and Harbor Workers' Act is very active.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.694" offset="3212494">The plaintiff has alleged in this lawsuit as being applicable which was denied, but he still alleged of it being applicable, limits the right of recovery to one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.687" offset="3248438">So therefore, I think that it is quite obvious and clear from the record that plaintiff having filed his suit in excess of one year from the date that this occurred that he has lost his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.624" offset="3324194">These are rights, if he had them that he failed to say and they are time barred and prescribed, corrected whatever other terminology we want to use in connection with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.047" offset="3377901">Going back to the Fifth Circuit's decision, we say it is wrong because it was unsoundly thought about, where it held at that the District Court was an Admiralty Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.772" offset="3424713">The District Court was not an Admiralty Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.865" offset="3433176">The District Court was not applying admiralty and maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.646" offset="3452298">The District Court was applying the law of Louisiana as defined by this very Court in the Rodrigue decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.056" offset="3485944">It was thoroughly recognized by Congress and this very Court that adjacent states to these tied lands of the coastal waters have a vital interest in the men who worked offshore, who they must of course take care of any instances that arise and this was thoroughly recognized by Congress in all of the hearings that were held and the discussions of different Congressmen that were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.647" offset="3604226">We then say that if that is true, little more can be said in this case because everything had been said in Rodrigue which is applicable to our situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.214" offset="3658561">The only basic distinction that you can find if that be a distinction is the simple fact that in Rodrigue there were death and in Huson it was a personal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.184" offset="3702447">Otherwise, the factual situation is identical; fixed structures and the relationship of the parties and the precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.817" offset="3732958">Unless the Court has some questions that they would ask of counsel, I would just like to keep a short time for rebuttal to answer my brother in this instance, but I think this is as clear as any case as can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.393" offset="3787292">If Rodrigue is not the law then we have to go back all over this situation and find out what it is because you got a lot of litigants, you got a lot of lawyers in Louisiana who do not know what the law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.604" offset="3836089">Thank you, your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1019.771" offset="4152798">I think there, perhaps is more than a little merit to Judge Brown’s observation in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.832" offset="4193026">If for instance, we subscribe to the statement in Rodrigue, statements I should say as I read the decision, that Congress was concerned with the welfare of the offshore oil worker, the amphibious oil worker who undoubtedly is subjective to a rather hazardous environment in which albeit on a fixed platform, called theoretically an artificial island, he is subjected to the vagaries of the sea, of wind, wave and weather.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.497" offset="4355612">To a large extent the equipment with which he works is affected by all of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.703" offset="4380481">In this particular instance, it would be difficult if one took a reasonable view of these circumstances, not to conclude that sea played a part in Mr. Huson’s injury, albeit it happened on an artificial island.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.785" offset="4456863">If as the Court suggests in Rodrigue, Congress was concerned with the protection of these equal groups, undoubtedly need protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.155" offset="4510257">It struck Judge Brown apparently as it should be apparent I would think to anyone who compares the two systems of law that under the maritime law which incidentally for almost a decade prior to Rodrigue in a number of cases several of which a certiorari had been denied and men such as Mr. Huson were allowed to have the benefits of the general maritime law when injured in this identical situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.153" offset="4650274">And a brief comparison I think will do no violence to the court's schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.826" offset="4677023">I would simply suggest that under Louisiana law for instance, if a man and under the law of most states, which have adopted the common law that unfortunately in our civil jurisdiction in Louisiana, we have adopted in this area, assumption of risk is a complete bar to recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.349" offset="4755077">Under the maritime law such would not be the case, contributory negligence are complete bar to recovery under Louisiana law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.615" offset="4792171">Anomalous as it maybe as civil law jurisdiction, contributory negligence is the complete bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.016" offset="4817771">Contributory negligence is not a complete bar under maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.688" offset="4840445">In flexible statutes of limitation as Judge Brown points out in his opinion, “As opposed to the more equitable and humane consideration of laches,” the doctrine which Judge Brown allowed Mr. Huson to avail of himself up in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.408" offset="4907318">The degree of legal duties to persons on the premises is a rather tricky thing at common law and to some degree in Louisiana where persons are classified as business visitors, invitees, licensee’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.388" offset="4975237">These are the problems now if Rodrigue is to be followed of the offshore oil worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.054" offset="4997911">This Honorable Court declared in Cameric (ph) that it is not going to run afoul of that under admiralty law, all persons lawfully aboard maritime premises would be entitled to the duty of reasonable care from the operator and owner of those premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.621" offset="5060187">Particularly is this important in the tied lands where much of the work that goes on, on these high seas platforms is special service contract and I think that these are some of the considerations that we are going through to Judge Brown’s mind when he declared that he ought not to let literalisms any more than he had to, he certainly cannot overrule this Honorable Court anymore than he had to let literalism bring about results which he considered unsound.</text>

            <text syncTime="1533.993" offset="6209679">If I may pose this hypothetical proposition; if you have a national park, totally within a state, an area of exclusive federal jurisdiction, totally within the state, through which ran a navigable stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.015" offset="6277702">I think that you could accommodate certainly the contracts, the other business activities that went on in the park and apply state law with no problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.600" offset="6320125">But let us get something into the stream, let us get something in the water, let us put something at sea and a tort occurs there which traditionally by locality would be within the jurisdiction of the admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.551" offset="6371847">It seems to me that it does no violence to Rodrigue, it does no violence to the Lands Act particularly, to apply maritime tort principles to what we feel by their very nature and service on maritime and admiralty premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.758" offset="6444677">And this is really the brawn of our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1617.516" offset="6543733">Although, the record will not support overt reliance on Snipes and Ousley and the pre Rodrigue decisions, but if it is manifestly unfair to apply this Rodrigue decision retroactively in this particular case at the time this action was filed, the law under which we operated and had been operating for almost a decade in the Fifth Circuit, was that laches apply, not prescription.</text>

            <text syncTime="1681.491" offset="6799629">They just came to different conclusions, but the litigants in the Fifth Circuit and I assume elsewhere, certainly would have a right, they should have a right to rely upon the pronouncements of that Court, not once but in at least four different cases, three of which I think were denied cert by this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.350" offset="6891057">We feel that this not the only matter of its kind in the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.064" offset="6917911">My brother, Mr. Melancon referred to some, before coming here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.421" offset="6939332">I will ascertain that there are actually three matters pending in the Fifth Circuit in which the decision is being withheld, dealing solely with cases filed before Rodrigue after the state prescription, dismissed by the District Court after Rodrigue was decided and now on appeal to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.990" offset="7053643">Perhaps, there are others in the District Court which have not yet reached that level that I am unable to canvass without a great deal of research, but those three do exist along with Mr. Huson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.898" offset="7117278">These people will retroactively lose their causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.791" offset="7136817">It may be said by my brother that they never had it in the beginning so they cannot lose what they never had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.732" offset="7160641">But this is a retroactive application of a time limitation of which there was no fair warning or reason given in view of Snipes and Ousley and the other cases that were decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.667" offset="7220305">We feel that in summary and in conclusion that the language, the literal verbiage of the Lands Act does not compel this Court to hold that that Congress intended to take out of maritime jurisdiction of what we contend was a part of the general maritime law of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.561" offset="7347887">Torts occurring on the high seas 80, some 80-90 or 125 miles at sea, it seems to us are certainly fitting subjects for admiralty and maritime jurisdiction traditionally and if not traditionally, certainly modernly and contemporaneously as our aircraft disasters which seem to have the blessing of admiralty law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1881.881" offset="7601170">No, that is right, but just to clarify that point Mr. Justice Brennan raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.277" offset="7618829">Secondly, if we ought to have the quality and uniformity as this Court recognized in Rodrigue, this is the function of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.298" offset="7666894">Congress can pass the laws and make these man seaman if they wish, make submersible rigs vessels, make fixed structures vessels and otherwise and clearly define the prescriptive periods which even under Huson, the theory that was advanced by the Court of Appeals, you have no uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.177" offset="7754352">You have Mississippi, you have Texas, you have Louisiana; each had different prescriptive periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.051" offset="7781833">Now, what do you apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.616" offset="7792177">So, the function here is the function of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.115" offset="7806179">I do not believe in fairness that it is the function of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.607" offset="7820076">Once it has fairly and clearly recognized Congress' intent in Rodrigue to now come and say, but wait death actions, yes, Rodrigue applies bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.655" offset="7864275">Personal injuries, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.780" offset="7872843">That is procedural, and therefore, admiralty and maritime law applies.</text>
