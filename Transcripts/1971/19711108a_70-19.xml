            <label>Mr. R. Kent Greenawalt</label>
            <text syncTime="37.022" offset="221786">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.932" offset="233384">This case is on direct appeal from an order of the United States District Court for the District of Colombia, dismissing an indictment on the ground that the government had failed to afford a speedy trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.806" offset="276852">The government appealed directly to this Court pursuant to the old Criminal Appeals Act 18 U.S.C. Section 3731, under the provision that permits an appeal from a judge decision or judgment sustaining a motion and bar when the defendant has not been put in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.931" offset="345397">Appellees were indicted on April 21st, 1970 on 19 counts of mail fraud; wire fraud and transportation of falsely made or altered security.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.918" offset="385313">The indictment charges that appellees in operating a home improvement company called Allied Enterprises to fraud the home owners in various respects, including persuading the designed deeds of trust on their homes in promissory notes by falsely concealing the nature of these documents from the homeowners.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.849" offset="457097">The indictment charges of the fraudulent scheme continued until February 1967, but the last particular act, mentioned in the indictment, occurred on January 19, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.023" offset="505789">After the indictment, appellee Marion made a motion to dismiss the indictment for failure to afford a speedy trial, which is set out on pages 12-14 of the appendix, claiming that the failure to indict sooner constituted a violation of his rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.663" offset="572349">On June 8th 1970, Judge Hart considered the motion to dismiss that developed in these proceedings that in February 1967, the Federal Trade Commission had issued cease-and-desist order against Allied Enterprises and Marion.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.749" offset="632640">And then in the series of articles in late September and early October 1967, the Washington Post had written about the activities of approximately a dozen home improvement companies which the articles claimed were defrauding the public, particularly and get a variance.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.663" offset="696274">The activities of Allied Enterprises were described in one of these series of articles.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.389" offset="719262">The articles also indicated that United States Attorney was generally aware of the abuses that it reported and as he planned an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.371" offset="759177">The articles did not indicate that an investigation or to bringing of criminal charges was planned in respect to any specific company or individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.492" offset="795644">Either in the summer of 1968, according to Mr. Marion or early in 1969, according to the Assistant US attorney, the records of Allied Enterprises were turned over by Marion to the US Attorney’s office.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.679" offset="852382">At the proceedings before Judge Hart, Mr. Jackson, representing Marion argued that given the public knowledge of the activities of Allied Enterprises, the failure to return the indictment until more than four years after the last noted event and more than two-and-a-half years after the articles, violated Marion’s rights to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.058" offset="941930">Mr. Franco, the Assistant US attorney stated that the Government's position at the motion should be dismissed in the absence of showing a prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.088" offset="982054">He indicated that so far as he knew the reason of indictment that had not been returned sooner was under staffing and a heavy case load.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.608" offset="1016117">Judge Hart did not write an opinion, he indicated in an oral statement which is set out at Page 39 of the Appendix that in the absence of a justifiable reason for the delay from 1967 in a lightly prejudiced cause there was a lack of speedy prosecution and he granted the motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.080" offset="1093962">Appellees did not allege and Judge Hart did not find any specific prejudice to appellee, such as the death of a key witness or the destruction of a particular document.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.828" offset="1137012">Judge Hart stated that, “The ability to remember to build up in one's recollection, to produce the necessary defense is bound to have been seriously prejudiced by the delay.”</text>
            <text syncTime="281.924" offset="1201378">This case presents the question whether in this kind of complex fraud prosecution, a defendant’s rights to a speedy trial or due process are violated per se by a lapse of two-and-a-half years between the time it is assumed that the prosecutor’s office has knowledge of complaints that might conceivably lead to a criminal prosecution, a lapse of two-and-a-half years between that time and the return of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.365" offset="1303151">I say that the case poses the questions of whether the lapse is per se a denial of constitutional rights because there is no showing on this record that defendant suffered any particular prejudice or that the Government acted purposefully, arbitrarily or even negligently in not bringing the case before the grand jury sooner.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.544" offset="1383817">We believe that there is not nor should there be such a per se rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.095" offset="1406073">Lapses in time between offense and formal accusation are, as this Court said in United States versus Ewell, governed primarily by the statute of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.225" offset="1446615">A potential defendant is further protected by the rule that guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.203" offset="1470439">A heavy burden on the Government that will ordinarily become greater as the time between offense and trial increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.204" offset="1506488">I shall argue that the Sixth Amendment does not apply before any formal accusatory action is taken by the Government that the Due Process Clause may reach certain exceptional circumstances in which time has elapsed before a formal accusation, but the due process is not denied unless there is substantial and special prejudice to a potential defendant and serious misconduct by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.594" offset="1604082">That neither substantial prejudice nor serious misconduct have been alleged here, much less shown and that therefore the judgment should be reversed and the indictment reinstated.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="427.089" offset="1782028">And I think in homicide there is no statute limitation.</text>

          <turn speaker="r_kent_greenawalt" startTime="429.812" stopTime="661.625">
            <label>Mr. R. Kent Greenawalt</label>
            <text syncTime="429.812" offset="1792895">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.710" offset="1796552">For homicide and some, I think the treason that in other words, in some tax offenses the statute of limitation is six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.581" offset="1863948">There is a preliminary question of appealability in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.375" offset="1879203">I believe our reply brief and the original brief indicate clearly why appellee’s motion before Judge Hart was a motion in bar within the meaning in Section 3731, and I did not plan to discuss that point further.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.942" offset="1933433">Appellees suggest that the constitutional questions need not be reach here because Judge Hart made a discretionary ruling under Rule 48 (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.328" offset="1975020">Again, I think the record and briefs indicate clearly that the rule was not and could not have been the source of this dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.744" offset="2004695">And so, I move now to the constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.884" offset="2025175">In our view, the Sixth Amendment does not apply until the Government has taken some formal accusatory action against the potential defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.306" offset="2054851">In terms, it states that the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.113" offset="2082122">It does not relate to the speed with which one has made an accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.742" offset="2100617">Appellees suggest that the time one becomes an accused, should be moved back for speedy trial purposes to some point before a formal action, such as when the government focuses on a potential defendant or has sufficient evidence to indict.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.197" offset="2166446">Such an interpretation is unwarranted by language or history or any prior decisions of this Court and it would be most unwise for reasons like those which persuaded the Court to refuse to draw a similar line in Hoffa versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.667" offset="2236349">There are many reasons why a prosecutor may decide not to prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.994" offset="2253695">Perhaps, in the typical instance, it is known that a crime has been committed, but the prosecutor thinks he does not have enough evidence to achieve a conviction against a particular potential defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.089" offset="2302073">But there are many other reasons for not going forward, especially in this kind of complex prosecution for fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.757" offset="2328718">Not all frauds are criminal and the prosecutor may doubt it.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.910" offset="2341362">The scheme involves falls on the criminal side of the line, where that he can establish to a jury their falls on a criminal side of the line, or he may doubt even though he is quite certain, he could get a conviction of whether the damage done to the public is great enough to justify using an available criminal sanction, or if there is a state offense he may wait to see if a state prosecution is going to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.036" offset="2449822">If he is sure that some company representatives have participated in a fraud, he maybe unsure which officials of the company are in fact culpable and which he can prove to be culpable to the jury's satisfaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.057" offset="2505933">Putting this altogether, the prosecutor’s decision, whether to prosecute a particular person may not be made until an investigation is progressed far beyond the point of focus or sufficient evidence to indict.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.613" offset="2560163">We do not believe that a Court can reconstruct in retrospect when either of those points is reached, and even if it could, it would not make sense to require indictment soon after either of those points have been reach and before an investigation is been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.887" offset="2637172">Suppose for example, that in this kind of case probable cause exists on the basis of consumer complaints in documentary evidence, that the United States Attorney judges that a conviction cannot be obtained unless there is an inside witness who is willing to testify to the fraudulent plan as a whole and can also testify the conversation that have been taken place in the --</text>

            <text syncTime="688.848" offset="2829015">Let me make two points in response to that Mr. Justice Marshall. First, the argument I am making now is not an argument about this particular case, but an argument as to whether in general, the Sixth Amendment should be read to say that a speedy trial -- that one becomes an accused for speedy trial purposes at some point before formal accusatory action is made by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.277" offset="2926818">And so what I am making now is a general argument about the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.399" offset="2943223">In terms of this particular case, I think there are two facts that -- in terms of as far as record before Judge Hart.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.813" offset="2984914">One is that Mr. Franco who argued before Judge Hart in these proceedings was not a member of the US Attorney’s office at the time most of this took place and he frankly admitted that he really did not know what had happened in terms of this particular investigation, but that he had been told there was understaffing in a very heavy case load.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.057" offset="3065894">The second point is that the Government took the position, I think quite justifiably on the basis of any decisions of this Court and of the great majority of other Federal Courts, took the position that unless there was some specific prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.646" offset="3136215">Appellees here are not even alleged something that would rise either to a violation of the Sixth Amendment or to the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.694" offset="3160457">And so, he relied primarily on that failure to show any specific prejudice in arguing before Judge Hart.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.701" offset="3188460">So, I think that he did not think it was relevant assuming if there was not a purposeful delay, what the reasons for delay were and I think that is part of the explanation why that is not more fully developed in those proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="922.896" offset="3765244">To return very briefly to the example that I was suggesting which is that probable cause exists, that the the prosecutor does not think he can successfully prosecute without an inside witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.757" offset="3812682">Then let us suppose two years later, but within the statute of limitation, an inside witness is willing to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.175" offset="3842357">Is prosecution to be barred simply because probable cause existed two years earlier?</text>
            <text syncTime="947.742" offset="3864614">We do not believe there is any good reason to distinguish cases in which the prosecution has little or no evidence from those as which there is probable cause, but insufficient evidence to convict in which the prosecutor will decide not to go forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.237" offset="3918635">If indictments are brought whenever a probable cause exist, the result would be a great waste of resources in the criminal process, and more important, very serious misfortune to those persons who were indicted but never tried and convicted, because the government indicts because it realizes that this is the probable cause stage and then decides it does not have enough evidence to convict and dismisses the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.005" offset="4001704">Well, that is a serious misfortune to the fellow that is indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.466" offset="4015497">Mr. Justice Brennan, in a concurring opinion Dickey versus Florida suggested a somewhat different point, that is the possibility that one might become an accused “after the government decides to prosecute and then have sufficient evidence for arrest and indictment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.705" offset="4076519">It is our position that that point also is too difficult to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.124" offset="4090207">That is a tentative decision to prosecute, and is typically subject to change particularly in this kind of case as an investigation unfolds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.780" offset="4120823">If that is thought to be the standard however, there is no reason to suppose on this record that a decision was made to prosecute these appellees until the case was -- shortly before the case was brought to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.411" offset="4179337">And that is on this record, you are going to find that is suggested standard, there is no reason to think that Sixth Amendment is implicated in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.527" offset="4215804">I turn now to the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.537" offset="4231791">It is our position referring extraordinary circumstances of the statute of limitation sets the time limit in which the government can act against the potential defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.526" offset="4267735">We do however believe, that in certain exceptional circumstances, the Due Process Clause may bar a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.932" offset="4293440">For example, if the government purposely delays, some ill witness to be known to be favorable, the defendant has a chance to die and the lack of that witness is prejudicial, we would believe that that would appropriately constitute a denial of due process, but absolutely precluding conviction for an offense is a drastic remedy, much more drastic than is involved in the implementation of most other constitutional rights, and we think it should be involved only in such exceptional circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.942" offset="4441397">Any lapse in time between offense and trial may affect a trial to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.377" offset="4463131">The defendant’s primary protections, as the Court has indicated and as I stated it earlier, are in the statute of limitations and the reasonable doubt requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.252" offset="4506704">It is not contended by appellees in this case that if the government had simply remained ignorant about its activities that trial had might be afforded would be a denial of due process, nor did they contend that they have suffered any greater prejudice than would defendants in a similar situation where the government had remained ignorance for three years after the offense had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.729" offset="4600640">Indeed, the possibility of prejudice here could be a bit less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.742" offset="4616627">Essentially, their claim comes down to this, because the government had awareness of some complaints and was involved in cases of higher priority, we were denied due process even though the government has been totally ignorant of what we were doing, we will not be denied due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.436" offset="4683396">We do not believe the right to a fair trial turns on such a distinction only if delay is oppressive and purposeful and causes specific prejudice should due process be held to bar an indictment within the statute of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.301" offset="4742851">We further think that if the Due Process Clause is read to entail nice distinctions of time, subtle degrees of prejudice and the reasonableness of the prosecutor's ordering of priorities in this area, the courts will be involved in time consuming collateral proceedings which will help to defeat the overall objects rather than help it of an expeditious determination of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.641" offset="4844206">Turning out to the showing in this case, appellees have made no persuasive showing of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.549" offset="4867820">Theories in Ewell are claimed as insubstantial, speculative and premature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.349" offset="4891017">They have not suffered from the incarceration and the anxiety in concern that formal accusation they bring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.779" offset="4920797">The government's case, it is said, is based on large part on documents as to these elapse in time is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.665" offset="4948382">Insofar as testimony make in turn specific conversation between salesman of the company and homeowners, it is highly unlikely that the salesmen who have many transactions each day would remember specific conversation, months or even weeks after the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.637" offset="5016196">What company officials would recall would be their normal motive business operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.457" offset="5035526">And there is no reason to suppose that that has been forgotten here, especially since appellees have had abundant notice that their operations were subject to attack first to the F.T.C. inquiries, then to the newspaper articles, then to a series of civil complaints, and finally, from turning over the records of the United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.721" offset="5112535">It is incredible to suppose that they have not carefully considered and reconsidered how they carried on their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.632" offset="5136150">Moreover, they are free to call any of the homeowner clients they have had and do not think they have been defrauded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.522" offset="5163735">It is even possible that there will not be a substantial discrepancy as to the crucial fact that this case goes to a trial,, since Mr. Jackson indicated on Pages 28-29 of the Appendix that at least about many of the basic operations of the company, there was not a dispute as to the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.255" offset="5238655">If appellees have suffered prejudice, that can be demonstrated at their trial and in a very small number of cases in which convictions have been overturned because of a lapse in time before arrest or indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.228" offset="5298632">The Court has made that determination with the record of trial in front of it, such as in the Ross case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.989" offset="5329665">Secondly, appellees have not subjective, much less demonstrated, the kind of government delay, which should be held to be unjustifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.708" offset="5360490">We have to suppose on the basis of the sparse record that the limited staff was initially focusing on complaints concerning companies deemed to greater social danger and that later considerable time was spent in developing this complex case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.815" offset="5428931">Fraud cases of this kind, and a number of the Court of Appeals have recognized this, are notoriously difficult and time consuming to develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.651" offset="5464248">A Court simply is not in position of assessing whether an ordering of priorities is desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.605" offset="5488072">Unless there is some special reason to suppose that this ordering is being performed in an arbitrary way, the Court should not consider pre indictment lapse caused by limited resources to be a form of unjustifiable delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.414" offset="5555363">If this position is rejected and an examination is to be made of the ordering of priorities, which we do not think is necessary, then surely it should be done in a full hearing which will allow development in this case that the facts concerning possible prejudice and the government's ordering of priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.279" offset="5630805">But it is essentially our position that the allegations here do not even make out a claim of constitutional violation and we thus contend that the case, the judgment should be reversed and the case should be remanded, so that the indictment maybe reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.794" offset="5692872">Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to reserver the remaining of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1417.280" offset="5742818">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.734" offset="5756611">On June 8th, 1970 District Judge George Hart dismissed the indictment of Marion and Cratch using his words for lack of speedy prosecution in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.140" offset="5802273">That formula of words can either be a paraphrase of the Sixth Amendment requirement of a speedy trial; it could be an exercise of the inherent discretionary power of the Court to dismiss for want of prosecution; or it could conceivably have been an exercise of power conferred especially upon the Court by Rule 48 (b) conferring power upon the District Judge to dismiss for unnecessary delay in presenting the charge to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.385" offset="5915226">With the exception of the jurisdictional issue, which I do not intend to take any protected time with, the principal issue raised by this appeal underlies all of the various predicates, the possible predicates for Judge Hart’s decision, which is whether any significance whatsoever is to be given to the elapse of time between the commission of an alleged defense and the date on which the indictment is filed in determining whether an accused should be required to stand trial on criminal charges, assuming, however, that there is technical compliance with the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.609" offset="6052108">Briefly, it is the appellees position that the filing of the indictment is really, merely a ministerial formality which is exclusively or virtually exclusively within the control of the government, and the government should not be given unlimited and unsupervised used of the entire period of limitations to assemble its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.086" offset="6122011">And then to indict only when it is in effect ready for immediate trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.915" offset="6141342">It is hardly necessary to emphasize the attention being paid to the problem of speedy trial today in this country and rules and statutes are being formulated in a number of jurisdictions to provide that once the prosecution has been formally commenced by the filing of an indictment, then specific periods of time limitations should be followed, following the formal accusation by indictment, and it is our position that there will be a frustration of those rules if the government can indulge itself during the entire period of the five year period of limitations during which time it assembled its case which is largely in secret, largely beyond the scrutiny of the defendant and probably will remain beyond the scrutiny --</text>

            <text syncTime="1776.365" offset="7179135">Mr. Marion did not contest those proceedings and by the first week of February 1967, the Federal Trade Commission issued a cease-and-desist order, and so all of the information about the business practices which the government has characterized as a complex fraud case, all of this information was in the possession of a government.</text>
