            <label>Mr. Hugh J. McClearn</label>
            <text syncTime="19.125" offset="150217">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.645" offset="164218">This case is before this Court on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit which affirmed and then affirmed on rehearing, the order of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado dismissing Mr. Love’s complaint against the Pullman Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.925" offset="249377">Judge Fay dissenting from both Court of Appeals judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.201" offset="266514">The issue before this Court involves the interpretation of Section 706, Subtitle 7 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.995" offset="321684">This section of the statute deals with the mechanics of lodging a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.321" offset="371003">More specifically it deals with the mechanical steps that one must take to lodge such a charge in a State that has its own Fair Employment Practices Acts, and Colorado does have such an act which makes discrimination at the terms and conditions of employment on the basis of race improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.581" offset="476016">Mr. Love is a black man.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.064" offset="489913">His complaint in the District Court was that he had been discriminated against in the terms and conditions of his employment by the Pullman Company because he was given a job classification of “porter in charge” where he performed the same functions as were performed by white people that were called conductors.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.171" offset="606314">And yet he received substantially less pay for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.918" offset="641319">He alleges that the only basis for the differentiation was race and that this constituted a violation of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.339" offset="679039">His complaint is that this discrimination was perpetrated against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.664" offset="696385">Everyday he was employed by the Pullman Company because of the continuing existence of the discriminatory job classification and pay differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.504" offset="747689">He first sought relief for this discriminatory condition in 1963 by approaching the Colorado Civil Rights Commission and of course at that time there was no 1964 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.679" offset="804427">The records of that context are lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.150" offset="818324">However, he did what was required by the Colorado Statute to initiate a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.028" offset="841834">He returned to the Colorado Civil Rights Commission in 1965 and verbally reiterated his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.933" offset="877361">The Colorado Civil Rights Commission investigated his complaint in 1965 and they discussed the matter with the Pullman Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.560" offset="919888">But the only relief that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission offered Mr. Love was the opportunity to be reclassified as a conductor.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.516" offset="963774">But if he were to do that, he would lose all of the job seniority and it would have actually have resulted in his being laid off and being put out of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.728" offset="1012571">This relief was offered to him in a letter from the Colorado Civil Rights Commission that is dated July 30th 1965 and to which he did not respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.887" offset="1065234">Instead, in May 19th 1966, he wrote a letter directly to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaining about this discriminatory classification and pay system.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.117" offset="1138168">And that letter appears to have been received by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on May 23rd 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.816" offset="1176933">The Colorado Civil Rights Commission was advised by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that Mr. Love had lodged a complaint with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.242" offset="1238687">The Colorado Civil Rights Commission responded by writing a letter to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission specifically saying that they did not want to investigate Mr. Love’s complaint waiving the 60 day deferment period provided for in the statute and --</text>

            <text syncTime="473.961" offset="1969488">Well, in answer to that question I think there has been litigation in the Norman case from your old circuit and I think the conclusion reached in those and other cases has been that that is not an exclusive remedy and that the Federal Rights created by Title VII of the ’64 Act can be exercised regardless of whether or not an attempt is made to seek redress under collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.415" offset="2091323">In answer to your specific question here, in this case, there is no record that Mr. Love made any formal attempt under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, that he was working under as a porter.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.030" offset="2169795">Well, the EEOC after having been told by the Colorado Commission that the Colorado Commission did not want to proceed went forward and put Mr. Love’s charge on an official form which was sworn to on July 23rd, served that on the Pullman Company which under regulations then and now in effect had the right at that time to respond to the charge of discrimination that had been lodged with the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.910" offset="2289332">During the course of the next two years, the EEOC investigated, found probable cause, attempted to conciliate and being unable to do so, on May 28th, 1968, Mr. Love filed this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.633" offset="2356205">Six months thereafter, on December 3rd 1968, the Pullman Company moved to dismiss and it is that motion that dismissed which was granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.891" offset="2609279">Now, the Tenth Circuit’s judgment on rehearing, quite properly in our judgment determined that the complaints that Mr. Love had made about events that occurred prior to July 2nd 1965, the effective date of this Act, were not properly considered in this case and its judgment on rehearing therefore, is quite different and on quite different grounds than its original judgment in this case or the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.818" offset="2748982">The Court of Appeals ruling on rehearing maybe summarized as follows: Because Colorado Statutes prohibit discrimination in employment based on race, 706b says that no charge maybe filed with the EEOC until 60 days after a proceeding under the Colorado Statute had been initiated or such earlier time as such a proceeding is terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.475" offset="2871549">Mr. Love did not go to the Colorado agency in 1966.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="1089.351" offset="4431059">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.355" offset="4447150">Title VII of the ’64 Act was a product of legislative compromise and accommodation in which Congress stressed voluntarily compliance by assigning the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the role of attempting conciliation but also conferred a right on the complainant to sue in a Federal Court if the commission's efforts were unsuccessful and this was layered over by another legislative compromise to give State and local employment commissions where they exist an opportunity to attempt first to resolve the complaint locally, while preserving that reasonable process of the complainants federal remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.345" offset="4647039">And one result of these compromises is the uncommonly complex procedural provisions of Section 706, set forth in our brief on pages 32 through 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.608" offset="4724153">And the act intended beneficiaries as has already been said are lay working men and women, many of whom are unlettered and uncounseled in attempting to pursue these remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.129" offset="4782145">Accordingly, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and most Federal Courts have from the outset taken the view that the procedural requirements of Section 706 should be applied so as to accomplish in substance the various policies of the Federal Statute but not in a way that imposes unnecessary obstacles to the ultimate determination of the merits of complaints made in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.646" offset="4924251">The problem of this application has arisen in various contexts discussed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.717" offset="4960509">Some of these arose because the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which under its appropriations, has never been generously staffed and still is not, quickly develop a sizable backlog of cases which is still growing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.005" offset="5041697">There have been imperfections and some inconsistencies in the commission’s application of this procedural requirements particularly in the early years but we believe its basic approach has been sound one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.870" offset="5117139">Indeed, the act itself specifically authorizes the commission to adopt procedural regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.974" offset="5161547">This is in Section 713(a) which is set forth on page 35 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.659" offset="5192267">And the adoption of such regulations is particularly appropriate with respect to the procedural matter involved here, the receipt of the complaint initially by the EEOC when there is a State agency to whom it must first be referred because the act, despite the detail of procedural complexity does not speak to the question of what the EEOC should do when it received the complaint initially in such a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.125" offset="5314207">And so, bearing in mind all of the policies of the act, especially the overall of policy of preserving a federal remedy on the merits ultimately in Federal Court, EEOC has adopted this policy of referring such complaint to the appropriate State agency under regulations duly adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.889" offset="5409188">The regulation is within effect at time of this complaint was a generally worded regulation set forth on page 38 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.995" offset="5449626">That regulation has since been refined and elaborated and the new regulation begins on page 36 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.382" offset="5495183">I think it is worthwhile to look for just a moment on page 36 at subsection A of that regulations in which the commission recites some of the reasoning behind the regulation particularly in the last two sentences of that subsection, the commission stated “It is the experience of the Commission that because of the complexities of the present procedures, persons who seeks the aid of the Commission are often confused and even risk loss protection of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.186" offset="5654426">Accordingly, it is the intent of the Commission to simplify filing procedures for parties in deferral States and localities and thereby avoid the accidental forfeiture of important Federal Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.861" offset="5721090">But in the previous part of the paragraph, the Commission also recites that its purpose is to encourage the maximum degree of effectiveness in the State and local agencies, also in accordance with Congressional intent under Section 706.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.690" offset="5804473">Now, we believe that this practice which the Commission has developed is a valid procedure under the Act and under the Commissions regulations both those existing at the time in the present regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.670" offset="5876362">The Court of Appeals, the majority of the Court of Appeals, believed in its word that the Commission could not manipulate the filing dates in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.068" offset="5917949">This meant that there were two possible defects as the majority of the Court of Appeals saw it, I think this is already been brought out; one would be that rather than have the Commission refer the complaint to the Colorado agency, Mr. Love should have been told to file a complaint and solve with the Colorado agency when the Commission received the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.324" offset="6018990">We hardly see that this would make a substantial difference in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.914" offset="6037381">The Colorado agency quickly indicated that it was waiving its jurisdiction having previously failed to satisfy Mr. Love.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.239" offset="6078654">The other possible defect under the majority opinion of the Court of Appeals was that after the Commission received word from the Colorado agency that it was waiving its jurisdiction, it should have asked Mr. Love to file another form of complaint within thirty days even though he had just --</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.008" offset="6581668">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.963" offset="6593580">I think it is important to begin with to straighten out the sequence of filing requirement of Section 706 and the time requirements of Section 706.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.434" offset="6635376">The Act is quite clear for the states that no charge maybe filed with the Act until a State proceeding was commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.651" offset="6660244">That is what the Act says and there is just in my humble opinion no room for construction otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.996" offset="6681665">In this particular case, Mr. Love, at no time filed a written charge with the Colorado State Commission nor any time was a written charge filed on Mr. Love’s behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.791" offset="6736835">Initially and in the Trial Court, we, because the State did listen to Mr. Love’s oral claim, and because the State did take some affirmative action and did terminate the proceedings, the Trial Court decided, yes he had complied with commencing a State proceeding as required by the Act but we must then look at the timeliness requirements of Section 706(d) which state an equally equivocal terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.458" offset="6847490">That the man must then file with EEOC within 30 days after the State has terminated proceedings or over than 210 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice has occurred, whichever is earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.638" offset="6900257">It is just that simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.558" offset="6903914">It is just that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.798" offset="6908826">And that posture went up to the Tenth Circuit and the Tenth Circuit affirmed on the timeliness issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.596" offset="6936097">At that point however, the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission interjected into the case their deferral regulation which is set forth in their brief and also in our brief and tried to justify their procedures utilized in this case based upon a 1968 regulation which of course was not in force at the time that this particular matter transpired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.660" offset="7016346">It was at that point that Judge Seth (ph) made the comments about the deferral regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.584" offset="7035990">Then on we hearing, it was pointed out to the Court that Title VII of Civil Rights Act did not become effective until July 2, 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.425" offset="7079353">Accordingly, the matters before the State in 1965 had to antedate the jurisdiction of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission and hence, they could not be the basis on determining the timeliness and hence, the basis for the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.457" offset="7147480">It was at this point that we got into the manipulative trial and debates and in manipulative procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.580" offset="7172035">Because this record is very clear and the Trial Court so found that there was one filing date in this case, that is May 23. 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.493" offset="7199621">It was not until the appellate arguments that the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission decided to say, “Well, we will use another filing date."</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.987" offset="7225639">This, the Tenth Circuit did not think was proper.</text>

            <text syncTime="1838.311" offset="7426886">Congress created statutory right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.998" offset="7437648">And within that statutory right, Congress imposed certain limitations, and certain guidelines, and certain things that had to be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="2847.895" offset="11465208">He was advised, at least judging from Mr. Reynolds so called waiver letter of June 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.365" offset="11499167">He was advised to return the Colorado Commission and file a written complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="2863.653" offset="11528319">He was told by the director to do, he chose not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.416" offset="11543366">That is certainly his decision but I believe Congress gave him a right that is now previously on a concept to that man to comply with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.769" offset="11568757">What Congress says he will do, obtain remedies under that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.851" offset="11593103">There is one other danger here gentlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.272" offset="11598746">I think it should be called to your attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.235" offset="11606582">In his getting back again in this manipulated filing date, a filing date could make it have at one time that is when its is received, it is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.807" offset="11652871">The EEOC would seem to say well, we can file them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.645" offset="11672306">At this time when we receive them or we can sit on and wait on it for a while and then fit it to the scheme of thing so that nobody is out at Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.689" offset="11704385">I suggest that this practice that they do not file things when they receive it could well deprive a man of his day in Court, a man who has complied with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.721" offset="11740538">We must bear in mind that he must go to the State first and thereafter, he has only 30 days within which to file with the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.504" offset="11771676">Let us assume the man has gone to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.763" offset="11780767">Let us assume that on the 29th day he sends this charge into the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission and instead of filing it, they refer it back to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.827" offset="11820995">Gentlemen that man is out of Court and yet he has done everything that the law requires him because the EEOC did not filed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.677" offset="11848372">There can only one filing date and it should not give them the opportunity to manipulate these things because as I say, the man has done what he is supposed to do and is not allowed to be in court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="2978.858" offset="11989119">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.254" offset="11994657">I would like to respond to two points that are arisen in the questioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.560" offset="12015869">First, this record does not show the manner in which the referral was made by EEOC to the Colorado Commission in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.951" offset="12069472">This referral was made during the first year of the administration of Title VII and the procedures at that time were not as regularized as they are now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.548" offset="12107820">But what the record does show on page 8 of the appendix is the Colorado Commission responds to that referral.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.812" offset="12160901">That responds says specifically that the case of Mr. Love has come to the Commission’s attention, the Colorado Commission’s attention and in the last paragraph of that letter, it seems quite clear that the Colorado Commission treated the referral whatever matter it was made in as adequate to invoke its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.443" offset="12279497">The Colorado Commission said under the circumstances, we could not in good conscience accept the 60 day deferment period and accordingly waive it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.329" offset="12322964">Will you proceed, speaking to the EEOC under the provisions of Title VII, to give any relief that you can to Mr. Love.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.396" offset="12359222">Now, I see nothing in the Federal Act that prohibits this State from treating a referral or an oral complaint of any kind, in whatever matter made as adequate to invoke the State’s jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.271" offset="12418781">This is the matter for the State agency to decide the matter of State Law whether its jurisdiction was invoked.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3092.752" offset="12444695">It is at first sentence, that it has come to my attention that Mr. Love has filed a complaint against the Pullman Companies from your office, that you say evidence is that something got from the State of Colorado in writing or orally or not it does not say just for a comparison.</text>

            <text syncTime="3112.928" offset="12525361">Well, I think this letter showed that however it was done and the testimony is that it was a referral from the EEOC but the testimony does not say in what manner or I think the letter shows that however it was done, the Colorado Commission treated this referral as adequate to invoke this response that it was waving its 60 day jurisdiction under the Statutory deferral period.</text>

            <text syncTime="3142.901" offset="12645315">Well, that is what it has under the Title VII, it has 60 days before EEOC can grant it sub-jurisdiction and it is waiving that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.076" offset="12685962">It treated its jurisdiction as invoked and it waived its jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3184.865" offset="12813126">We do not believe the Federal Statute presumes to say that the State could not have treated this as the adequate invocation of its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.641" offset="12844264">It does in 706b say that if the State requires too much that a merely written complaint dating back will be treated as having been adequate for purposes if that invoke in the federal remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.871" offset="12893165">And the other point I wish to respond to is Mr. Justice Blackmun’s question about whether the Pullman Company has been prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.943" offset="12933498">Judge Seth (ph) own opinion on rehearing, he states the record shows that the Colorado Commission in the 1965 proceeding discussed the complaint with the Pullman Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.228" offset="12986579">They have had noted that at least since, shortly before the Federal Act became effective of Mr. Love’s complaint and any lapse of time that occurred thereafter, is attributable to the fact that the company was unwilling to give re-dress and so we ask the Court to remand this case for hearing on the merits of this long standing complaint of Mr. Love.</text>
