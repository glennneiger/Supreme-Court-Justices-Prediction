            <text syncTime="46.623" offset="260147">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.321" offset="278955">This case is here on writs of certiorari to the Second Circuit, presents two questions concerning the extent to which the duty to bargain under the National Labor Relations Act survives a change in employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.277" offset="354815">The first question is whether Burns International Protective Agency which took over Wackenhut’s job of furnishing guard services, Lockheed is a successor to Wackenhut for purposes of the National Labor Relations Board and second, if Burns is a successor employer, is it obliged not only to recognize and bargain with the union represented by Wackenhut’s employees or also obliged to honor the collective bargaining agreement which Wackenhut had entered into with the union covering these employees.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="115.162" stopTime="140.785">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="115.162" offset="534328">Mr. Come if –- perhaps this question is a little bit too early, but if you will bear in mind now certainly when you want, if Burns have not employed any of the Wackenhut people, they employed 27, I think some such figures, they have not employed any, would you contend they were a successor employer because they moved in and performed the same function?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="140.785" stopTime="237.983">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="140.785" offset="636833">I would say the fact that they -- well, as I will develop further to continuity of the employing enterprise is the test and among the factors that are very crucial there is the complement of the workforce and had they not employed for nondiscriminatory reasons, the Wackenhut employees, that would be a big factor for holding that they were not a successor.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.590" offset="772042">Whether it would be conclusive or not, I will develop as I get to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.587" offset="800046">The basic facts here are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.684" offset="808405">From July 1, 1962 to July 1, 1967, Wackenhut, a nationwide guard service provided plant protection services for Lockheed Aircraft Service Corporation, a subsidiary of the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation at its facility at the Ontario Airport in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.627" offset="908193">What Lockheed was doing there was serving, was maintaining and repairing planes and Wackenhut was supplying guard service for the Lockheed operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.640" offset="964199">On March 8, 1967, the Board certified the United Plant Guard Workers as the exclusive bargaining representative of the Wackenhut employees working at the Lockheed Airport facility.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="237.983" stopTime="239.388">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="237.983" offset="1025639">How about the unit in place?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="239.388" stopTime="501.141">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="239.388" offset="1031281">It was a unit of about 42 employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.671" offset="1056359">On April 29, 1967, about a month after the certification, Wackenhut and the Union entered into a three-year collective bargaining agreement covering these employees and the collective bargaining agreement among other things contained a clause making the agreement binding on successors and assigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.901" offset="1157296">Lockheed's then current service contract with Wackenhut was due to expire on June 10, 1967 unless extended by Lockheed.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.290" offset="1206824">In May of 1967, Lockheed invited various guard services, including Wackenhut to bid or rebid the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.308" offset="1254890">On May 15, Lockheed advised the prospective bidders including Burns, that Wackenhut’s guards were represented by the United Plant Guard Workers who had been certified by the Board and that there was an outstanding collective bargaining agreement between Wackenhut and the Union covering those employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.116" offset="1338168">Although, Wackenhut submitted a bid, the successful bidder was Burns.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.143" offset="1366276">In the next moth, June of 1967, Wackenhut or Burns sought to employ when it took over on July 1 as many of the Wackenhut guards as possible for the reason that they had, they cleared security and top security clearance that was needed for this type of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.316" offset="1478916">The Wackenhut guards applied for jobs with Burns.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.752" offset="1500650">As they did so, Burns’ officials in turn assisted the American Federation of Guards, another union with whom Wackenhut had a contract covering its employees in Los Angeles County.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.312" offset="1558955">That contract did not cover these employees because this was in San Bernardino County, but nonetheless, Burns assisted the American Federation of Guards in obtaining membership applications from the Wackenhut guards as they came to apply for jobs with Burns.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.468" offset="1651533">Representatives of Burns told the guards that they could not get uniforms without signing American Federation of Guards membership cards and that they had to join the American Federation of Guards in order to work for Burns.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.965" offset="1721541">On June 29, Burns’s Branch Manager concluding that a majority of the employees to be used that the Lockheed Airport job had signed American Federation of Guards membership applications or were already members of that union recognized the American Federation of Guards as their bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.229" offset="1814641">Wackenhut had terminated its guard service at midnight on June 30 and Burns began to furnish such service on July 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.176" offset="1862393">On that date, Burns' Lockheed force like Wackenhut’s consisted of 42 guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.871" offset="1893218">Of the 42, 27 or more than a majority had formally been employed by Wackenhut and 15 guards were transferred from other Burns’ jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.743" offset="1952673">The Burns guards performed essentially the same tasks at the same stations that the Wackenhut guards had performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.048" offset="1993841">Moreover, although Burns used its own supervisors, their functions and responsibilities were similar to those of their Wackenhut predecessors, both utilize area supervisors who perform similar functions and both had full time supervisors on the Lockheed job with similar functions.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="513.611" offset="2128111">They were already members.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.886" offset="2133231">They were apparently transferred from the Los Angeles County and thus were under the Burns’ contract with the American Federation of Guards which I believe had a Union Security Clause as did the United Plant Guards contract with Wackenhut.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.240" offset="2222674">On July 12, the United Plant Guard Workers requested that Burns recognize it as the bargaining representative of the Burns employees at Lockheed and honor the collective bargaining agreement that it had with Wackenhut.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.202" offset="2274501">Burns refused and the union filed unfair labor practice charges with the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.259" offset="2294772">The Board found that the -- that Burns violated Section 8 (a) (2) and (1) of the Act which prohibits illegal assistance by an employer to a labor organization by assisting the American Federation of Guards in organizing and by recognizing American Federation of Guards when it did not represent an un-coerced majority of Burns’ employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.675" offset="2396336">This finding was sustained by the Court of Appeals and it is not an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.721" offset="2420578">The Board also found that a bargaining unit limited that the guards working at the Lockheed Airport facility was appropriate, that Burns continued essentially the same operation at that plant that Wackenhut had, and therefore, it was a successor employer to Wackenhut and accordingly the Board held that Burns violated Section 8 (a) (5) and (1) of the Act by refusing to recognize and bargain with the United Plant Guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.964" offset="2545548">Finally, the Board drawing support from this Court’s decision in Wiley against Livingston which I will get to later, the Board held that as a successor to Wackenhut, Burns was obliged to honor the collective bargaining agreement between Wackenhut and the United Plant Guard Workers and that by refusing to do that that was an additional violation of the bargaining obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.894" offset="2653277">The Court of Appeals in an opinion by Judge Hayes sustained the Board’s finding as I indicated, the bear legal assistance, sustained the Board’s finding of -- that Burns was a successor, sustained the finding that there was a refusal to bargain and Burns refusing to recognize United Plant Guard Workers as a representative of the employees, but held that the Board had exceeded its powers under the statute in finding that there was also a further refusal to bargain in failing to honor the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.351" offset="2815131">Both the successor issue and the propriety of the Board’s finding requiring a contract to be honored before this Court on a cross petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.388" offset="2891200">Now, as this Court knows in enacting the National Labor Relations Act, Congress made the policy declaration, Section 1 of the Act that protection by law of the right of employees are organized and bargained collectively, safeguards commerce from interruption by removing a frequent source of industrial strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.684" offset="3004467">The way the Board -- the Act implements that policy is to provide a procedure whereby the Board can conduct a secret ballot election and get the employees' wishes concerning a bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.918" offset="3065384">If a majority vote for them, it certifies them as the exclusive bargaining representative under Section 8 (a) (5) of the Act, it is a refusal to bargain, to refuse to honor the certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.031" offset="3133825">Furthermore, since the Act also rests on the premise that industrial pieces promoted by maintaining stability into bargaining relationship, a board certification is normally not subject to challenge for one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.676" offset="3192339">This Court endorsed the Board’s rule to that effect in the Brooks case or longer, if there is a collective bargaining agreement of reasonable duration and under Court principles that had been approved by the Courts collective bargaining agreement of up to three years is normally regarded as reasonable duration.</text>

            <text syncTime="865.472" offset="3535588">Now, in line with the general principles that I have just outlined, had Burns remained the employer here, it would have been obliged to recognize the United Plant Guard Workers, during life of the three-year collective bargaining agreement, notwithstanding any changes in the complement of the employees that occurred during the life of that agreement and if Wackenhut had repudiated that agreement or it unilaterally modified its wage provisions or any other provision relating to the employees terms and conditions of employment, it would not only have been subject to a suit for breach of the agreement under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, but it would have violated Section 8 (d) and therefore 8 (a) (5) of the National Labor Relations Act as well because Section 8 (d) provides in relevant part that where there is in effect a collective bargaining contract, the duty to bargain collective shall mean that no party to such contract shall terminate or modify such contract without giving prescribed notice and waiting until the expiration date of such contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.786" offset="3852819">And as I understand it, nothing in this Court’s recent decision in Pittsburgh Plate Glass affects this general principle because this contract almost exclusively, if not exclusively dealt with mandatory subjects of bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.049" offset="3921887">Now, I do not understand that Burns disagrees with what I have just been setting forth as the obligation that would have been imposed on Wackenhut nor do I understand that there is any disagreement with the next point that I am going to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.677" offset="4008405">Namely that early in the administration of the Act, the Board evolved the doctrine and it has been uniformly approved by the Court of Appeals, although this Court has never had occasion specifically to pass on it, that the mere transfer of operations from employer to another does not distinguish -- extinguish the obligation of bargain under the National Labor Relations Act and such claims for a leave substantially in fact the identity of the employing enterprise then the duty of the original employer to recognize and bargain with an incumbent union evolves upon the new employer as a successor employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.145" offset="4182276">The rationale for the doctrine is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.952" offset="4201502">That if the employing enterprise remains intact, continuation of a bargaining obligation serves the policy of averting industrial strike in that enterprise no less than that -- by imposing that obligation upon the successor employer then did imposing it on the original employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.390" offset="4287288">Moreover, where you have maintained the employing enterprise, there is little reason to believe that the employees’ original choice of a bargaining representative would have been altered by the mere change in employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.319" offset="4346952">The point at which the difference between us develops is what are the criteria for determining whether you have a successor employer for purposes of the National Labor Relations Act and that also gets back to the Chief Justice’s question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1108.741" offset="4508597">Now, my reading of this record is that Burns was one of the competing bidders, great many people bid for this contract and this company has awarded it to Burns as the low bidder, so there were competitors of the man you -- of the company you now suggest is this company to which they are successor, these employees were then, the 27 employees ultimately taken within on the open labor market, were they not?</text>

            <text syncTime="1153.957" offset="4689469">Yes you have Your Honor and it is Burns’ point that that does make a difference as that distinguishes -- that distinction should be drawn between this kind of a situation in one where you have a more conventional transfer of assets or of facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.750" offset="4764702">We submit and we believe that the cases in the Court of Appeals support our submission that so long as the new employer ends up with substantially the same bargaining unit or industrial community as it sometimes called, he is a successor employer for purposes of the National Labor Relations Act whether he does that as a result of direct dealing with the prior employer or he does it through dealing with a third party as was done in this case because the important thing as I tried to indicate the important rationale for writing this -- the loss of the successor employer on the bargaining obligation is that the change in employer has not made a significant change in the bargaining unit which had originally selected the union as the employees’ representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.531" offset="5127804">And that is what we had here because irrespective of how Burns ended up with the contract and the findings of the Board as sustained by the Court of Appeals you had a situation where, I am quoting from the Court of Appeals appendix 189, “Both Burns and Wackenhut are a nationwide organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.302" offset="5238877">Both perform the identical services at the same facility, namely providing plant protection service for Lockheed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.742" offset="5272627">Although Burns used its own supervisors, their functions and responsibilities were similar to those performed by their predecessors and finally and perhaps most significantly, Burns commenced performance of the contract with 27 former Wackenhut employees out of its total complement of 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.978" offset="5353606">Moreover, as shown by Burns’ assistance to the American Federation of Plant Guards, it too recognized this Lockheed operation as a separate operation, as a separate bargaining unit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.091" offset="5434064">So that, we submit that since the change in from Wackenhut to Burns that is substantially intact, the employment conditions at the enterprise that is involved there, namely the supplying of the guard services to Lockheed which was a separate unit, the Board properly found that Burns is a successor employer to Wackenhut and which brings me to the second question as to whether Burns was not only obligated to recognize and bargain with United Plant Guard Workers’ Union and prohibited from making any unilateral changes in existing working conditions without first bargaining with the union and whether it was also obliged to honor the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1577.011" offset="6381681">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.565" offset="6395997">The United States Chamber of Commerce in its amicus brief stated and I quote, “In a service industry such as the providing the plant protection service, generally the only variable in which productivity of efficiency gains can be made is labor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.255" offset="6466736">I submit Your Honors that in this case the labor gains that have been made, have been made at the sacrifice of rights that are federally protected and rights which this Court sought to stabilize and its Wiley decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.514" offset="6531729">In my view, there are classic facts here of Wackenhut Corporation having had a contract for guard services for a number of years on an unorganized basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.174" offset="6578331">The guards that my client represents organized those people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.462" offset="6591497">They were certified by the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.968" offset="6605603">They entered into negotiations for their first contract which did contain the successors and assigns clause and without at least the control or participation of the parties, Lockheed elected to let its contract with Wackenhut up for bids.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.376" offset="6671223">Following the premise that the only commodity this guard agencies have is labor, Burns then was in the position to ignore the stability created by the bargaining agreement and effectively then to bid on the basis of labor only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.257" offset="6730677">The result was that the employees lost the benefits of the gains they had made through the collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.316" offset="6762965">I suggest that a doctrine, that a successor employer and assuming for the moment Burns was a successor, albeit a non-consenting party to what has clearly been held to be a non-consensual agreement and rather a public obligation does not do violence to clear concepts of Federal Labor Law Policy as they were established prior to the time of the Burns’ decision because prior that time in a successor situation it was held that the successor was bound to recognize and bargain with the incumbent union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.088" offset="6902041">It was held that the successor was bound to recognize existent terms and conditions of employment whether or not those terms and conditions of employment were established by a bargaining agreement or otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="2279.904" offset="9193293">So I would not state that a headcount is absolutely essential to the operation of the successorship concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.748" offset="9240627">And may I conclude by indicating that in a situation such as presented here, it would appear to me a certain stability is created not only for the employees on whose behalf I argue but for those employers who operate in the service industry area which is highly competitive but typified generally by competition based on labor rates, rates of people who generally speaking are barely above the minimums to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.865" offset="9369149">So I would submit there could be stability for the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.968" offset="9381584">Moreover sophisticated parties anymore in labor relations do enter into voluntary adjustments to adopt to such proper changes as it may take place with a change in ownership and finally this Court has made it clear in Wiley that the arbitration machinery is to be fostered and is of course available or binding upon a successor to correct these situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.697" offset="9480431">I submit that Burns has finally placed an entire National Labor Relations Act in harmony with the Federal Labor Policy generally which is to promote and foster bargaining through agreements and informal arbitration on disputes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2372.338" offset="9563082">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.528" offset="9575830">The Court has zeroed in on the narrowness of this case with respect to the successorship issue, it does involve service industry type businesses and our position before this Court at this time which has not been answered by the Court below or by counsel is that this facility operation of either Burns or Wackenhut was not an employing industry under either Burns or Wackenhut and therefore there could not be any continuity of the employing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.980" offset="9725564">We are not contesting the general law that a successorship will be found where there is no change in the employing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.299" offset="9754926">We are dealing with a particular service industry and what this facility was which everybody has assumed this facility operation was just a small portion of Wackenhut business in California and it was a very, very small portion of Burns’ business in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.732" offset="9824620">And the cases unfortunately have not dealt with this question of what is an employing industry in the service industry context and we say that an employing industry is -- must be a large enough portion to where there is managerial authority and skill which is necessary to run the business and to make decision on matters that are critical to employees and that the employing industry is used with a purpose therefore in determining the employees desires about having a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.726" offset="9960561">Now, as to the regards to the facts in this case, as been pointed out that there was an annual renewal contract between Lockheed and Wackenhut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.429" offset="9999432">There was not a term agreement between Wackenhut and Lockheed and that the contract between Wackenhut and the Plant Guards was the first contract so that the successors and assigns clause had not been in any previous agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.340" offset="10055020">Now, why did not this facility have the indicia of an employing industry?</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.088" offset="10086054">As we have said it was a very, very small portion of the business of each.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.437" offset="10103399">There is only one supervisor there, part time when Wackenhut had it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.055" offset="10121894">When Burns took it over there was one supervisor with limited authority, limited authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.696" offset="10144464">The wages, the benefits, the working conditions, all other decisions were established at the corporate headquarters not at the facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.584" offset="10179990">With respect to Burns it was established on the anterior basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.837" offset="10197022">There were separate office staffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2533.454" offset="10207471">There was no office staff at the facility of Burns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.830" offset="10225025">There was no payroll and accounting staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.561" offset="10235892">All that was handled at the sub-office where Burns is in it, the California office for Wackenhut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.211" offset="10258566">And there were separate manuals and procedures of these two competing companies of which this facility was merely a very small portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.081" offset="10314050">In any event, there was a substantial change primarily because of the quickness within which this operation, facility was integrated in the Burns as regular operation because of Burns’ practice of interchanging guards regularly to have the flexibility, to have the particular guard work at more than one location where his services could be best utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.103" offset="10426064">They had this practice and within six months, less than the majority of the former Wackenhut employees were employed at the facility, so that immediately upon Burns taking this over, integrated it into its other unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.008" offset="10509760">From a policy standpoint as the Chief Justice, I think pointed out, there would be serious problems if this rule of successorship applied in the service industries to the companies like Burns and that would cause a lack of stability in labor relations and this kept --</text>

            <text syncTime="4741.715" offset="19040516">Now, to be sure Wiley only compelled arbitration, however the considerations upon which the Court compelled a non-consenting employer to the contract to go to arbitration under that contract we submit are precisely the same considerations that justified the Board in applying the same principle to its interpretation of 8 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="4775.878" offset="19177188">The Court relied upon the fact that a collective bargaining agreement is not in any real sense, the simple product of a consensual relationship; it is a cold governing, an industrial community that is negotiated under the principles and requirements of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.011" offset="19277708">It binds employees who did not even consent to the contract or weren't even employed at the time it was negotiating and may not even be a member of the union which negotiated it, but albeit a member of the bargaining unit if the union has to represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4822.107" offset="19362135">More importantly the Court relied upon the fact that the objective of National Labor Policy requires that the rightful prerogatives of owners independently to rearrange their businesses and even eliminate themselves as employers, be balanced by some protection to employees from a sudden change in the employment relationship because the employee and the union usually does not have a say in these transfer negotiations and we submit that that is a fortiori in an industry like the service industry which is subject to its rapid turn on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4863.182" offset="19526393">Finally the Court relied upon the fact that industrial strife could be avoided by submitting employees’ claims to arbitration leave it -- rather than leaving them to a test of economic powers.</text>
