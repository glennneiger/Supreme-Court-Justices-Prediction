            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="36.868" offset="221168">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.092" offset="238095">The question in this case here on writ of certiorari to the Fifth Circuit is whether respondent owns and operates facilities for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.333" offset="295042">If respondent does, then it is a “public utility” subject to the Commission’s jurisdiction under Section 201 of the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.381" offset="343212">Under section 201, electric energy is deemed to be transmitted in interstate commerce if “transmitted from a state and consumed at any point outside thereof.”</text>
            <text syncTime="81.726" offset="400577">On the basis of an extensive record, the Commission concluded that electric energy was indeed transmitted from respondent’s facilities in Florida and consumed out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.848" offset="453031">This conclusion was based independently, one on analysis of the independence of respondent and out of state utilities and two on studies introduced by the Commission staff showing that electric power flows could be traced from respondent’s facilities to an out-of-state utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.729" offset="540593">Before turning to the facts of this case, I would like to note just briefly the consequences of Commission jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.606" offset="576120">The only immediate consequence in this case, if the Commission’s order is upheld by this court, would be to require respondent to comply with the Commission's uniform system of account.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.586" offset="623976">The establishment of jurisdiction however would also subject respondent's future wholesale sales of electric energy to Commission jurisdiction and also would enable the Commission under certain circumstances to what a respondent could interconnect and sell electric energy to other utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.667" offset="712375">The pertinent facts in this case are as follows: Respondent is a major electric utility, it is the largest utility in Florida and in 1965 ranked ninth in the nation in terms of revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.136" offset="794190">Its facilities are located wholly within the state of Florida and serve over 900,000 customers -- six of them were wholesale customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.057" offset="833896">Although, none of its facilities extend to the state line, respondent is interconnected with the Florida Power Corporation and the Florida Power Corporation in turn is interconnected with the Georgia Power Company as well as other utilities across the state line.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.333" offset="907039">In addition to its interconnection with the Florida Power Corporation, respondent is interconnected with three other Florida utilities and these five Florida utilities make up the Florida Operating Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.398" offset="963255">Through the Committee, these utilities coordinate the installation and maintenance of generating equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.738" offset="992616">They share generating reserves and they exchange information on a daily basis to better coordinate their operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.209" offset="1034517">By these activities therefore each member is able to provide its customers with more reliable service.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.558" offset="1067953">As I mentioned before, the Florida Power Corporation has interconnections across the state line with the Georgia Power Company and these two companies exchange substantial amounts of electric energy from year to year.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.627" offset="1144231">All of the utilities, that I have referred to thus far are members of the 140-member Interconnected Systems Group, a group of interconnected utilities spanning the southeast and central portions of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.314" offset="1218941">The first ground of the Commission's finding of jurisdiction in this case was based on an analysis of respondents operation as a part of its vast interconnected system.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.879" offset="1269201">As the Commission staff expert witness testified, all our 140 members of the Interconnected Systems Group and indeed all interconnected systems, operate in synchronism -- that is they all operate at precisely the same frequency.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.805" offset="1336910">On modern systems charges as current is supplied as alternating current, alternating at 60 cycles per second.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.737" offset="1384662">It is hardly a generating electric system, I noted that it is not somehow interconnected with others in this grid pattern?</text>

            <text syncTime="365.266" offset="1534709">I do not think the argument does not go quite that far because we depend upon an analysis of the operations by reason of interconnection.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.219" offset="1682562">Now that situation we would say that the two utilities would not be coordinated so as to provide mutual system in the case—</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="417.956" offset="1745465">Well, it might be such an interconnection so that if a utility wanted to purchase power from the other utility it could at a certain rate over period of time but the interconnection would not be strong enough to allow emergency service in the event at a very large generating unit would go out on one side of the interconnection.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.800" offset="1840864">In these circumstances, we would suggest that you have quite a, you have a minimal amount of coordination between utilities and you certainly do not have the situation that you have.</text>

            <text syncTime="539.169" offset="2230402">Part of this deal is the geographical contours in the state of Florida, and here is Florida Power and Light in a peninsular state.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.801" offset="2272930">I take it from much you just said, most other large utilities in this country today are subject to FPC jurisdiction as a public utility.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_huntington" startTime="557.900" stopTime="898.497">
            <label>Mr. Samuel Huntington</label>
            <text syncTime="557.900" offset="2305322">Yes, but the exception of the state of Texas which is isolated has no interconnections across the state line, but virtually every other large utility, well, not every other, but certainly most large utilities are subject to the Commission’s jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.716" offset="2376584">With respect to the small utilities, I would like to just point out that the consequences of jurisdiction maybe very small for some utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.959" offset="2429560">Without reaching the question as to whether the Commissions has discretion to decline to exercise jurisdiction in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.291" offset="2470833">The Commission does have the specific authority to classify utilities and to prescribe different rules depending upon the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.724" offset="2512629">Now this is done with respect to the Commission’s accounting requirements, the Commission has established five different classes of utilities based on their revenues with very specific requirements for the large utilities and very minimal requirements for the small utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.012" offset="2593713">So in the event that a relatively small utility is interconnected to the interstate grid and is subject to the Commission’s jurisdiction, the effect on that utility maybe very small, the effect of the federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.768" offset="2668737">Well, because all systems operate in synchronism, this means that the generators connected to the interstate network, all operate at precisely the same frequency and that they speed up and slow down in units.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.043" offset="2737805">And all electric clocks for instance attached to the interstate network whether it be in Saint Louis or Miami, will keep precisely the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.535" offset="2783780">Now, electric energy cannot be stored so that the total generation of a network is constantly adjusting to meet the networks total load.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.950" offset="2841459">In order to assure that each utility ultimately produces enough power to supply its customers and any obligation it might have to neighboring utilities and in order to assure that frequency is maintained as closely as possible at 60 cycles per second, each system employs what is known as high line control with frequency bias.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.156" offset="2946262">Now, the operation of high line control with frequency bias is explained in some detail in our brief and I do not plan go into the mechanics of it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.056" offset="2989939">What is important to note is that this control method, under this control method, each member of the Interconnected Systems Group shares in the burden of maintaining network frequency as closely as possible to 60 cycles per second and under the control method, each member will contribute increased generation to meet an emergency on another members system.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.820" offset="3112923">The record contains a dramatic example of the response of systems comprising this interstate network to an emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.075" offset="3150017">On February 17th , 1965 a Midwestern utility in the Interconnected Systems Groups suffered a generation loss of 580 megawatts.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.348" offset="3195052">This loss caused a drop in frequency on the Interconnected System.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.668" offset="3220339">Each of the other systems including respondent reacted automatically to make up the deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.277" offset="3246775">Respondent’s contribution as shown by exhibits in the record was to increase each generation by eight megawatts.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.791" offset="3284809">Other benefits that also accrue from interconnected operations are as follows: As a result of frequency bias, deviations in the frequency are kept to a minimum, clocks keep better time, precision industrial operations are benefited, speed ups and slow downs of generating equipment are minimized, and as a result the inadvertent exchange of energy between systems is also minimized.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.692" offset="3400479">In short, the evidence before the Commission showed that respondent, the other Florida utilities and the other members of Interconnected Systems Group, all operates interdependently.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.703" offset="3448544">All the components of their respective systems are bonded together electromagnetically.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.183" offset="3470383">That is as an engineering fact, the components are tied together electrically and magnetically.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.435" offset="3499431">As a result, the occurrence of an event on one system will have a necessary and measurable effect in other systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.710" offset="3540495">In a thorough and clear opinion, the hearing examiner concluded that the cause and effect relationship among respondent and the out of state utilities constituted the interstate transmission of electric energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.082" offset="3602040">This conclusion was approved by the Commission and we believe this is fully supported by the evidence just summarized and furthermore is consistent with the scheme of regulation adopted by Congress in enacting the Federal Power Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="900.942" offset="3677482">Well, I would like to turn to that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.347" offset="3687095">The legislative history of the Act reveals the dual concern on the part of congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.641" offset="3708202">On the one hand, Congress recognized the increasing tendency to interconnect utilities and recognized that there is a need for federal leadership in coordinating the interconnection of these utilities and coordinating the nation’s power facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.862" offset="3793152">On the other hand, Congress made clear that its intention not do unduly interfere with the authority of State Regulatory Commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.746" offset="3828678">As this court recognized in the Connecticut Light and Power case, Congress resolved these competing concerns first by defining the terms of grant of federal jurisdiction, broadly and precisely, employing in the words of this court an engineering or scientific test.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.213" offset="3918540">Second, the granted jurisdiction was then limited by exempting certain facilities and most importantly by limiting the Commission’s rate jurisdiction to sales of interstate energy at wholesale.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.078" offset="3993981">Now, since the enactment of the Federal Power Act, vast interconnected systems have replaced relatively modest networks and the interstate nature of the electric industry has steadily risen.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.017" offset="4045704">What happens on one part of a network can have a dramatic and sometimes catastrophic effect on the other parts of the network as is happened in various power failures in the last few years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.253" offset="4090739">The hearing examiner noted the 1965 northeast power failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.490" offset="4111637">We are not talking here about some remote effect on commerce such as you might be discussing in terms of other regulatory statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.200" offset="4178510">What we are talking about here is an electrical effect throughout a common network.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.971" offset="4201602">We are talking about an engineering fact that when you have a disturbance on one system it causes a reaction on other systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.613" offset="4252175">In short, we submit that the jurisdictional test adopted by Congress was designed to and is capable of taking into account the complex and interdependent nature of interconnected electric systems.</text>

            <text syncTime="1083.742" offset="4408701">We believe the language of statute is transmitted in interstate commerce, electric energy moving from moving from one state to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.221" offset="4438585">Now, if there is a disturbance in one state such as a loss of generating equipment and if the other states contribute by plan control mechanism, this high line bias with frequency control, this is a system developed in the last ten or fifteen years which was not in effect when the Power Act was first enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.857" offset="4517057">If true, this common control mechanism signals a sent-out to the other systems supply extra power until this disturbance is cleared up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.146" offset="4562301">We submit that this is a transmission of electric energy that the cause and effect relationship here, disturbance plus contribution in neighboring systems to increase generation in response to a very sophisticated control mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.707" offset="4636489">We claim that this does constitute the jurisdictional standard and engineering fact which is what Congress had in mind in setting forth the bounds of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.662" offset="4736381">Well, I would like to turn to the alternate basis for Commission jurisdiction which is completely independent from the basis I have been discussing thus far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.701" offset="4792492">At the hearing before the examiner, the Commission’s staff introduced studies based on data for commercial meters which show that at times during 1964, electric energy flowed from the Georgia Power Company to respondent over the facilities at the Florida Power Corporation and at other times flowed the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.625" offset="4888205">Respondents attack on these studies focuses on the staff’s treatment of the conducted bars used to join together transmission lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.533" offset="4927806">These bars or junction points are known as buses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.929" offset="4949436">What the staff did was to assume that energy flowing into a bus on two or more transmission lines becomes mixed together or commingled, thus energy flowing out of the bus on other transmission lines would be commingled energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.446" offset="5019444">That is would include energy from all the lines entering the bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.117" offset="5062180">To understand the basis for this assumption, some background is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.304" offset="5086944">Electric energy on all commercial systems in use today is transmitted from generator to point of distribution not as a unit on a single transmission line but on three physically separate lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.763" offset="5148698">In other words, from generator to point of distribution point, you have three lines not one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.400" offset="5175238">If you observe power lines crisscrossing the country, you will notice they come in sets of three that is because there are three separate lines coming out the generator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.195" offset="5222468">Now, the power in each line is not steady but pulses back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.931" offset="5253397">Now, the pulses in the three lines, in the three separate lines, are not in phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.331" offset="5271055">By that I mean, on the first line the power maybe pulsing forward when on the second line the power is changing in direction and on the third line the power is pulsing backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.452" offset="5319539">In reference to exhibit 59 at page 241 of the appendix, gives diagrams of the actual power curves and by studying those diagrams you can see graphically what I am describing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.748" offset="5400623">In short, modern systems use what is called as three-phase power with each phase being transmitted separately from generation all the way to the distribution point thus buses which I discussed before as the junction device for joining transmission lines really does not consist of one conductive bar but consists of three conductive bars, one bar for each phase in three-phase power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.249" offset="5522667">Now, the problem that persons attempting to trace power flows have is this, commercial meters do not measure what actually takes place from instant to instant in each phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.182" offset="5574389">Instead, they merely record the average power flow in all three phases considered together but this is not a fact because the power flows are separated, if you would adjoin together the three phases you would have a short circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.124" offset="5662161">Thus, reliance solely on meters, reliance solely on commercial meter readings will lead you to conclude that over a given period of time, power on any part of a system is constant in direction and magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.106" offset="5726109">Well, this is not the fact, the engineering fact is that power is transmitted in three phases and then on each phase the power pulses back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.502" offset="5767695">Staff witness Dr. Jessel testified at some length that in using the meter readings for tracing purposes, the treatment of a bus as a point to allow for commingling was appropriate to take into account the physical reality of what happens in each phase of a three-phase bus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.417" offset="5851392">Now, the references to his testimony which have to be, his testimony has to be studied carefully in relation to the exhibits on this matter, for it is fairly technical but the references to his testimony are listed in our brief at page 13, are particularly like to draw the courts attention to his testimony at pages 142 to 145 and 149 to 153 of the appendix and exhibit 61 which is at page 243 of the appendix, I think a study of these exhibits show that Dr. Jessel was able to demonstrate that power entering a bus on a single phase would at times contribute to the power flowing out of the bus on all other lines, flowing out from that phase.</text>

            <text syncTime="1520.319" offset="6154935">This is an effect which can be measured by using scientific instruments by using oscillograph, attaching it to the various parts of a phase, you can show that the power coming in on a given line will at times be greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.235" offset="6230585">Well, if you would turn to the page 5 of respondents brief, I think I can explain on this diagram here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.522" offset="6319820">If you consider AB there to be a single-phase of the bus, in other words it is a conductive bar joining together, let us say, all the phase As of various transmission lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.280" offset="6374781">Now, respondent claims that power from G3, the generator at the extreme right could never serve L1 because L2 being a 10 kilowatt load is greater than the five kilowatt generating power coming out of G3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.303" offset="6478853">Now I think, in reference to Dr. Jessel's testimony shows that his testimony is that if you compare the power curves of G3, L2, and L1 or just G3 and L2, you can show that at instance during each cycle, there will be an instant or more than one instant when the power coming out of G3 will be greater than the power being consumed by L2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.502" offset="6599643">Exhibit 61, which I will not go into now, but exhibit 61 keyed in to Dr. Jessel's testimony does show how this can be shown graphically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.036" offset="6665785">Furthermore, the respondent introduced an exhibit in which he attempted to show that converse and Dr. Jessel testified with respect to that exhibit that you could verify experimentally that power did in fact in each phase, did in fact go over an intervening lines so that it might flow out on other lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.876" offset="6789188">Dr. Jessel was questioned extensively on these exhibits and these testimony by the hearing examiner and we submit that the hearing examiner was in a very good position to probe the validity of his assumptions underlying these tracing methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.726" offset="6860554">The examiner's conclusion that the treatment of a bus as a point did indeed appropriately reflect the actual dynamics, the physical reality of three-phase power transmission in out view is completely sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.830" offset="6932966">In conclusion, we urge that the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed, I would like to reserve the remaining portion my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1966.467" offset="7939516">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.677" offset="7952368">At first I would like to answer two or three statements made by the FPC with respect to the Colton case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.623" offset="7992179">Florida Power Light Company used the tracing used in the Colton case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.432" offset="8015375">The FPC used a different method as in this present situation here, we FPL use the Colton method of tracing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.667" offset="8052365">Please do not confuse the terms power and the electric energy, they are not synonymous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.818" offset="8076920">This is a play on words, it was brought in the record before the examiners and I will get into that in a little more detail later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.861" offset="8121119">The electric energy never reverses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.913" offset="8133344">It always goes from generator to load.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.735" offset="8148600">Your house bulb does not supply electric energy back to the generator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.992" offset="8169602">There is something called reactive power which during part of a cycle does reverse but that by definition is not energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.430" offset="8211398">And the Commission witnesses be very careful to speak about power and not about electric energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.186" offset="8238461">Next, getting back to there first and primary basis, cooperation between utilities does not determine jurisdiction, interstate transmission does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.697" offset="8276495">Neither does clock speed determine jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.471" offset="8295617">And further, we have we been unable to find in the record any testimony of any witness that the cause and effect theory is actual transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.456" offset="8367506">Dr. Jessel and the others did not so testify that we can find or what we look for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.300" offset="8418915">This was a 3:2 decision by the Commission with the strong dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.565" offset="8443993">To review for a moment the jurisdictional requirements, a statute says, jurisdiction depends upon transmission of electric energy only in interstate commerce and it specifically excludes jurisdiction over facilities used for the transmission electric energy only in intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.163" offset="8538347">The statute also says that electric energy shall be held to be transmitted in interstate commerce if transmitted from a state and consumed at any point outside thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.380" offset="8595189">The Commissions positions seems to be that it should not be subject these restrictions or it may take astonishing position on page 36 of this brief right in the middle of that page that it should not have to abstain from asserting his jurisdiction “until such time if ever as it can be proven as a fact in common law terms that there is an actual transmission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.589" offset="8712009">We say there is tantamount to an admission that they have not been able to prove their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.100" offset="8738131">And it is a good reason but they could not prove because the facts just are not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.448" offset="8759447">Since we are talking about transmission of electric energy, I plead that thermal electric energy needs to be known.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.037" offset="8793824">Electric energy is defined by the Commission in its text, by others, as that which does work and is normally measured in kilowatt hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.281" offset="8838755">It is what we all as householders pay for each month, when we pay our bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.546" offset="8859862">So many kilowatt hours of electric energy measured by that electric meters sitting on the back of our house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.495" offset="8895702">We believe in essential to understanding of this case that certain facts concerning undisputed nature of an electric energy be understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.807" offset="8932900">I realize there are some facts that are not agreed upon but these facts at least are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.132" offset="8954216">One there is no storage or pooling of electric energy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.969" offset="8969576">It is generated and consumed instantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.560" offset="8983891">A generator never puts out more electric energy than is consumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.185" offset="9002386">The load tells how much is to be put out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.901" offset="9013253">For example, if a generator is running at full speed, there is no load on it, there is no electric energy being produced by that generator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.822" offset="9048989">Next, there can be no flow of electric energy in opposite directions in a conduit simultaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.601" offset="9088068">They all, the Commission fully agrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.986" offset="9101651">Third, you cannot get the electric energy flow from a generator pass the first load that is bigger than the generation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.665" offset="9148358">That load is insatiable and instantaneous, it gobbles up all electric energy and not one bit gets fastest and there is no disagreement in the record on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.867" offset="9189109">On electric energy, and I am talking about reactive power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.125" offset="9206141">If you could get pass it, then you would have counter current flows of electric energy and the Commission experts with us has agreed that that can not be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.059" offset="9237906">Now, for the FPC, the Commission to have jurisdiction over us, it has to prove this, electric energy from Florida flowed 180 miles through the system of what we called Corp or Power Corp into our system or vice versa went from us up to Corp into the state of Georgia without meeting any barriers of a load big enough to swallow it or a counter current flow.</text>

            <text syncTime="3066.256" offset="12338745">There is nothing magic about that, this has existence ever since the first two alternating current generators were ever hooked up to a load.</text>

            <text syncTime="3079.302" offset="12390886">It means that anytime two or more generators are supplying one or more loads, they inherently and unavoidably generate electricity at the same frequency.</text>

            <text syncTime="3132.791" offset="12604881">The next generator to it, the one that is normally supplying it, will instantaneously pick up a little generation and draw also perhaps a little bit a current from electric energy from L4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.820" offset="12648975">Well, that means then that G5, the next one to the left is going to have to pick up a little to supply L4 and so on down the line, but the directions of flow of electric energy do not change merely the magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.558" offset="12699862">Now, that is a cause and effect, that is the swapping that the examiner talked about and we say that is not the jurisdictional event.</text>

            <text syncTime="3172.852" offset="12765064">Testified as result of that there was inherently transmission across the state line.</text>

            <text syncTime="3182.829" offset="12804979">What that means is at the edge of each system are tie lines to another systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.126" offset="12830161">And each systems senses what the frequency is, if it drops it just generates a little more electric energy.</text>
