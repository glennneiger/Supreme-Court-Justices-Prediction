            <label>Mr. Rodger N. Bowman</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73730">To-wit a gun, to-wit a 22 caliber pistol.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.943" offset="97449">The matter proceeded for the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.740" offset="108630">A jury was selected and sworn.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.146" offset="118243">The defendant entered his pleas, plea of not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.527" offset="131826">The state put its first witness on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.043" offset="145828">This first witness Mr. Kenneth Albright (ph) was asked what type of gun were they looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.893" offset="173204">His answer was a 22 caliber riffle.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.468" offset="187519">To this, counsel for the defendant objected on the basis that the indictment charged at the robber was accomplished with the 22 caliber pistol.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.675" offset="232346">At the much argument out of the presence of the jury, the judge ruled in favor of counsel for the defendant and the Attorney General said, well, in this case, then I think that what ought to be done is a jury instructed return of verdict of not guilty and this was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.823" offset="316982">The judge instructed the jury that because of the fact that there was a mistake in the indictment that he was instructing the jury to return a verdict of not guilty for the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.704" offset="360450">Then a short time later, the defendants were again indicted charging the same facts had been charged in the original indictment, except this time charging that the robbery was accomplished with a deadly weapon, to-wit a gun, to-wit a 22 caliber riffle, this thing -- the only difference in the two indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.666" offset="444355">Through this indictment a plea of double jeopardy was filed alleging both a violation of the State of Tennessee Constitutional Provisions and United States Constitutional Provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.294" offset="494824">This plea was overruled and the matter went to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.798" offset="520842">At the trial, for the prosecution it was asked, was there any other robbery at this service station on this day and the answer was no.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.931" offset="565354">As a result of this second trial, the defendant was found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.500" offset="587715">After this occurred, proper appeals were perfected, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals with one judge dissenting overruled the Montgomery County Criminal Court and ordered the defendants released.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.996" offset="641632">The State of Tennessee petitioned the Tennessee Supreme Court as a result of this, certiorari was granted by the Tennessee Supreme Court and the Tennessee Supreme Court overruled the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.260" offset="698683">The question involved is the mere changing of the type of weapon in this indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.003" offset="725642">Does this create a different offense so that the double jeopardy provisions do not apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="171.630" offset="760228">Now there are several tests that have been applied over the years to determine whether or not double jeopardy or the double judge provisions of the constitutions apply and one of these is are they the same offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.215" offset="822504">Tennessee’s armed robbery Statute 39-3901 sets out in the common law terminology, I mean the robbery provisions just as it would be in the common law, those things are not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.970" offset="897528">It adds the punishment and then it goes on to say but if said robbery is accomplished with the use of a deadly weapon then the punishment shall be such and such.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.882" offset="937234">The Tennessee Supreme Court has held that this particular statute when the punishment was increased by the legislation in 1955 for armed robbery, they did not create a separate offense but the only offense was robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.481" offset="999614">Now, back at the original trial of this case when the Attorney General asked that the judge return a verdict or direct the jury to return a verdict to not guilty, counsel for defendant objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.350" offset="1051128">We felt that they could go ahead and proceed because robbery was still vague that they could not prove a weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.231" offset="1082579">Even if they could not prove the particular type of weapon that was involved.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="257.022" offset="1101805">Mr. Bowman, under Tennessee practice, did the State have any remedy by way of amendment to the indictment available at this point or was it stuck with the indictment as drawn?</text>

          <turn speaker="rodger_n_bowman" startTime="269.509" stopTime="326.211">
            <label>Mr. Rodger N. Bowman</label>
            <text syncTime="269.509" offset="1151751">There is a statute in Tennessee, Mr. Justice that provides that by agreement of counsel, an indictment can be amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.633" offset="1188218">So that if this had been done -- yes, the indictment could have been amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.004" offset="1213714">My thoughts of the matter were had the Attorney General said to counsel for the defendant and I was counsel for the defendant at that stage, let us amend the indictment or if you refuse to amend the indictment then I will ask the judge to grant a mistrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.510" offset="1279751">We may have been in a different situation but this was not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.349" offset="1303052">The Attorney General said to the Court, well, are you to go ahead in trial on this one or I will get him -- have him re-indicted and they have chose to have the request of the judge to instruct the judge to return a verdict of not guilty and then did re-indict him.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.228" offset="1358641">So there was a procedure that it had been taken, it had appeared it had been followed but it was not.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.694" offset="1444427">We did request that the jury not be instructed to return a verdict of not guilty, we felt that this would be a problem that would arise in the future if this was done.</text>

            <text syncTime="417.698" offset="1744522">Your Honor, to be perfectly frank with you, at the time this was tried originally, I had been practicing for some 5 months or 6 months and I was not even aware of the statute that allowed an amendment of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.241" offset="1794677">I think the record will show, I state to the Court, I did not know whether an indictment could be amended or not at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.128" offset="1818187">But since I have had time in doing much research on this case, of course I have found that there is a statute which would have allowed the indictment to be amended.</text>

            <text syncTime="457.149" offset="1902301">The particular law involved in this case, there is not any that is directly in point, a complete search of the records, all I say is complete as searches cannot be done because I have been able to do has not rebuild the case that is directly in point with the fact situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.070" offset="1985998">There are cases which hold that is not double jeopardy to indict a man the second time where the item stolen, we will say is described improperly, such in one case where the serial number of an automobile was misstated in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.436" offset="2051408">This cases which all that if you indicted for stealing a white horse, you cannot be convicted for stealing a black horse and to be indicted for stealing a black horse then is not double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.240" offset="2106683">But each of these cases involved a particular thing stolen, the description of a necessary element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.331" offset="2143046">In this case, the second indictment, it charges that $70.00 was taken from the person of Johnny Brant(ph).</text>

            <text syncTime="1474.258" offset="5970716">The central issue of course in this case is whether these two indictments, the first charging robbery accomplished with a pistol and a second charging robbery accomplished with a riffle charges two separate offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.705" offset="6024528">If they do, then of course, the defendant or the petitioner here is entitled to his plea of double jeopardy if not, we contend that he is not entitled to his plea of double jeopardy and was properly convicted of robbery with a riffle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.750" offset="6096626">Now, in Tennessee as the questioning of Mr. Bowman has indicated where the indictment describes a particularity, the State is required to prove it with particularity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.668" offset="6148349">And where there is a material variance between the indictment and the proof, the prosecution can be terminated at that point either by a dismissal or by a directed verdict or by a mistrial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.217" offset="6214595">Well, does not the very fact that there was a directed verdict of acquittal under the first indictment show that in Tennessee at least this was a separate offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.504" offset="6323683">That is our position that it is a separate offense and that the second indictment charged a different offense and that the second indictment charging a different offense, it would preclude the petitioner from prevailing on his plea of double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.942" offset="6381466">It is our opinion that the Fifth Amendment through the Fourteenth Amendment applicable at Tennessee prohibits successive prosecutions only for the same offense and not necessarily for the same act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.796" offset="6432874">The same offense is the proscription to which the Fifth Amendment applies and incidentally to which the Tennessee double jeopardy constitutional provision also applies.</text>
