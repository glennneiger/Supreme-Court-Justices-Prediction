            <label>Mr. Anthony G. Amsterdam</label>
            <text syncTime="25.165" offset="174355">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.949" offset="193476">This case and the three cases to follow, present the question whether the infliction of the penalty of death on each of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.955" offset="237467">There is a cruel and unusual punishment within the Eight and Fourteenth Amendment to the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.705" offset="272471">The cases present a range of factual situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.240" offset="290652">In this first Aikens case, the death penalty was inflicted upon a multiple murderer for an intentional killing of the particularly atrocious sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.093" offset="350002">In the second case, the Furman case, we have a killing in the course of the burglary murder which may or may not have been intentional and it is not attended by the same aggravating circumstances and in the third and fourth cases Jackson and Branch, we have the infliction of the death penalty for the crime of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.549" offset="431922">The briefs of the parties and of the amici canvas a broad range of considerations under the Eight and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.939" offset="469434">But I think there are mergers from the briefs, the clear impression that the central issue in this case, the real nerve of this controversy, is the scope and indeed the propriety of judicial review of legislatives, State legislative determinations to use the penalty of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.533" offset="579775">The briefs on behalf of the respondents primarily support the death penalty on the ground that it exists on the statute books of 41 States and of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.607" offset="640066">And that it has been put there by the legislatures of 41 States in the Federal Government and that those legislatures are the primary keepers of the national conscience in penal matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.643" offset="688235">And the elected representatives of the people whose judgment is entitled to respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.766" offset="708715">I agree with all of that, but for me I think that is the beginning and not the end of analysis under the Eight Amendment because judicial review of legislative judgment is just as inevitable as it is difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.519" offset="783739">Under a constitution which commits to the courts, protection of the individual under guarantee such as Cruel and Unusual punishment or Due Process or Equal Protection of the laws, precisely because these guarantees are fundamental statements of the most basic principles of our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.383" offset="875168">The least conferring to the narrow historical circumstances that gave them birth.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.811" offset="896902">They are cast in general terms their generality makes them difficult to interpret and it also creates the risk which Mr. Justice Frankfurter frequently warned the court about that the court may read its own dispositions in the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.077" offset="961999">But at the same time, these very general prescriptions or the bedrock of a constitution designed to endure for time and to give continuing and constant expression to the notion that there are limitations on the power of government to deal with individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.568" offset="1051964">Guarantee such as cruel and unusual punishment and Due Process and Equal Protection are broad statements in grand form, cash for an unforeseeable future and intended to be construed to give continuing protection to limitations upon governmental power.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.048" offset="1157917">Such protections to the individual are not likely often to be added to the constitution by the amending process because when they most needed they are least likely to commend the political approval necessary to add so they are put in general form and they are committed the courts to construe as times change during the life of the nation and visit by the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.419" offset="1255406">I conclude from that that although difference and circumspection the legislative judgment is vital.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.572" offset="1295948">That abnegation of judicial, the legislative judgment is impermissible because the very existence of a clause like the Eight Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, belies the idea that legislatures are totally free in their choice of penalogic methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.740" offset="1392601">The important thing is plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.057" offset="1397930">It is that the Cruel and Unusual Punishment clause is a restriction on legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.732" offset="1416634">In the context of American government where penal sanctions are primarily legislative.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.698" offset="1440458">It can only have meant to limit legislative means and this court has in fact pretty times appied it to invalidate legislation and the only cases and fact in which it has applied the clause to vindicate any plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.681" offset="1500435">The question is what are those limitations on legislative judgment?</text>
            <text syncTime="362.599" offset="1524049">How stringent are they?</text>
            <text syncTime="365.338" offset="1535021">Where does this court get the standards by which to determine?</text>
            <text syncTime="370.025" offset="1553829">The problem of standards is critical because of the generality of cruel and unusual punishment that I described.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.489" offset="1591654">The language is not crystalline it is not clear you cannot look at the punishment and see whether the cruel you cannot look at it to see whether it is unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.406" offset="1619344">And history although relevant cannot be controlling because of the evolutionary nature of the guarantee and its projection into the future as I described.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.452" offset="1679530">The state of California, State of Georgia and Texas to some extent in their briefs have all made the point that at the time of the Eight Amendment was written, Capital punishment was widely used.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.864" offset="1733133">The Fifth Amendment clearly envisages that there will be capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.285" offset="1750792">The Federal Congress put capital statutes on the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.894" offset="1773258">All of these misconceived I think our submission to the court which is not that when the Eight Amendment was ratified in 1791 it was intended then and there to do with capital punishment, anymore than it was intended then and there to do away with whippings or brandings or cutting off the beers or anymore than Equal Protection clause when originally put in to the constitution, it is intended to give equal rights to indigents or to women.</text>

            <text syncTime="500.188" offset="2074397">That is correct Mr. Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.827" offset="2089026">The problem of construing the Eight Amendment emerges I think from what I have said that if the language isn't clear and if history is not controlled where does the court get standards, where does it find the basis for judgment in determining whether legislation is cruel and unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.280" offset="2194769">The primary problem with formulations, that you frequently find in Lard Port cases such as announcement of punishment may shot the conscience of the court or be unnecessarily cruel or some such thing in that in wide subjective judgment and one thing I think all the parties here may Your Honor, it is not the purpose of the constitution to allow the judges to write their own penalogical reflections into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.424" offset="2311380">The arguments made by the state in these case to sustain capital punishment, would I think equally sustain branding of confidence meant on the forehead with the letter C or cutting the hands off the pickpockets or any atrocious punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.953" offset="2381493">And these punishments I think would plainly be condemned by the Eight Amendment but it beholds us to ask why.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.296" offset="2414825">Is it simply because we would be shocked, we would be in testimony uphold to those punishments more than the punishment of death, if they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.617" offset="2452128">I do not think so; I think it is because there are objective and judicially cognizable basis for making a determination under the Eight Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.942" offset="2497476">And in our brief we have tried to set forth what are those standards, what those objective standard for judicial judgement are?</text>
            <text syncTime="615.044" offset="2533839">Specifically we think that the question under the Eight Amendment is whether the punishment applied to a particular individual would by all available objective indications be unacceptable to general, contemporary, conscience and standards of decency.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.175" offset="2626417">It if were generally and uniformly applied to any reasonable proportion of persons subject to penalty for that crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="764.525" offset="3131729">Is to look and see whether the punishment inflicted in a particular case would be tolerable, acceptable to prevailing standards to decency generally applied.</text>

            <text syncTime="785.362" offset="3215112">And I should say I take the court's time at this point to talk about the Eight Amendment standard because this court has very little developed theory and a concept to the Eight Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.848" offset="3253042">And the parties are I think more in disagreement about the theory of the Eight Amendment and they are about any other aspect to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.628" offset="3284180">Any good three reasons to this; first of all our conception of the theory of the Eight Amendment picks appropriate count of the different nature and the different roles under the constitution of legislature in the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="979.526" offset="3991785">The second reason why I think our theory or standard of the Eight Amendment commends itself to the court, is that it assigns a proper function to the Eight Amendment in the constitution of the democracy because in a Democracy it is not at all likely that the legislature will put on to the statute books a penalty which is cruel, which is unacceptable to public conscience in a generally applicable uniform fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.739" offset="4128667">A Stature which is going to be generally applied, which would be repugnant to public conscience if generally applied will not commend enough public acceptance to get on the statute for in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.185" offset="4174433">The problem in Democracy is that legislation maybe inactive in such a form, that it can be arbitrarily, selectively spottily applied to a few outcast thrive, whose political positions are so weak and with personal situation is on popular and were so ugly that public revulsion which would follow the uniform application of the penalties applied to them, does not follow in its few outcast creatures are condemned to that punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.470" offset="4327511">What we are saying essentially is that a punishment cast in a form so that it can be used this way, comes to the court suspect under the Eight Amendment and when it is actually applied so infrequently, so incredibly relict as the death penalty is that the suspicion materializes and the penalty is identified as the cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.585" offset="4440046">This is no new constitutional conception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.444" offset="4447465">I am really saying nothing more than what Mr. Justice Stone said in footnote 4 of Carolene products which is that where legislation is cast in the form such as unlikely to make it politically remediable, such as to sterilize the ordinary political processes that keep the legislature acting decently and keep legislation reflective of the public conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.391" offset="4551223">Then a particular obligation devolves on the court to assess the constitutionality of that legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.289" offset="4578809">The third reason why I think our theory of the Eight Amendment amends itself to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.104" offset="4606080">Is that it does not imbibe subjective judicial judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.418" offset="4631367">It does not ask this court to put itself in the position of super legislature and decide matters of penalogical policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.063" offset="4657907">In fact our theory, I believe offers the only alternative to subjective judicial judgment because if one looks for a moment at the grounds on which the State seek to support capital punishment that it is the retribution of the permissible legislative aim and that in some cases retribution requires killing people that deterrence is a permissible legislative aim and legislature could find the capital punishment had something deterrent efficacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.377" offset="4799178">You immediately see that the same arguments could and that would be made if the legislature for fraud boiling in oil as a punishment for crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.006" offset="4829689">Legislature might say that is a horrible curse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.512" offset="4843690">Let it boiling in oil if they do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.434" offset="4851422">That could only fit retribution for that crime and the legislature might direct at an awful thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.800" offset="4880889">We got to stop that and the only way to really make it a horrible and prevent this from doing it if we correct them in boiling in an oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.911" offset="4909310">Boiling in oil if they do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.731" offset="4916624">And the State could be able to make essentially same arguments that they are making here against capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.119" offset="4938149">In favor of capital punishment, those arguments would not be sustained but why would they not be sustained, is it because boiling in an oil was somehow more shocking to the digestive system, to the intestinal reaction of people or particular judges I do not think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.522" offset="5003769">I think it is because an objective standards which we invite this court to apply the capital punishment generally, would be offended by boiling in oil.</text>

            <text syncTime="1477.806" offset="5984928">A last point that I think is that some significance before I turn to the capital punishment itself is that our theory of the Eight Amendment is also without historical support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.744" offset="6044696">The Eight Amendment seems to advent the result of a confluence of three primary concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.676" offset="6080431">A concern against the excessive punishments which you see in English Laws far back and that is a part of a concern against the selective imposition of harsh punishments, and a concern without right for a better.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.621" offset="6156187">The most immediately relevant one I think is the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.626" offset="6168203">The concern against the selective use of harsh criminal punishment which immediately led to the English Bill of Rights provision in 1689, that is now the language of the Eight Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.066" offset="6217940">The English Bill of Rights provision was put there largely as a result of the (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.439" offset="6243435">And if you look back at the trial of vote, what you see is that the actual punishment imposed on earth, it was not barbaric.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.347" offset="6275096">It was -- that he was to be divested as a clergy man, that he was to be imprisoned for life and then he was to be pilloried and whipped annually on the occasion that the perjuries because of his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.030" offset="6341760">And the complaint lodged against that judgment which led to the Bill of rights was not that it was harsh at the time when they were still killing thousands of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.040" offset="6377809">It wasn't intrinsically barbaric, it was it was selective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.806" offset="6396931">One fellow was singled out and given unprecedentedly harsh punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.303" offset="6418874">Now, capital punishment in its functioning today is a precise reflect of what happenned to (Inaudible) and the waking of the life leads me to mention that, because I will be arguing both of the selective cases, I would have to develop part of my constitutional argument in the second.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.593" offset="6492017">But, will simply state in this first that the essence of our argument applying this theory to the Eight Amendment, is that the exceeding contemporary rarity of capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.020" offset="6545724">The fact that the death penalty although allowed by law in overwhelming majority of American Jurisdiction is in fact applied more infrequently than any penalty on frauds and against the background of an ideological debate that makes it clear that the attrition and use of the death penalty is a repudiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.245" offset="6634645">That circumstance presents for us the primary objective indicator by which this Court can say that not only is it no longer true, as the Court suggested in Cope v. Dallas (ph) that the death penalty is still generally accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.919" offset="6697339">But to the contrary, the death penalty is virtually unanimously repudiated and condemned by the conscience of contemporary society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.793" offset="6744882">Now, developing that point factually I think it is not difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.824" offset="6769019">The national crime commission in its study, three years ago pointed out that the most salient characteristic of capital punishment was infrequency of its use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.422" offset="6811338">And every inform commentator who has studied, perhaps accepting the respondents from these cases come to the same conclusion and if I may just read Professor Herbert Wechler's description which I think is a fair one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.867" offset="6873195">There is a striking contrast between the broad extent to which the penalty of death is authorized by law and the relative infrequency with which the sentence is actually imposed or carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.884" offset="6933173">Despite the imperfections in the data, it is clear that capital punishment is executed only in a fraction of the cases where it can be legally imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.862" offset="6973088">A fraction that is trivially infirmity and has been steadily diminishing in recent years I should say that we do not rely on the dwindling to zero of the death penalty in the last few years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.759" offset="7036722">That is of course in large measure the result of judicial status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.955" offset="7053545">But what I would point out is that even before the national campaign began which secured those judicial status in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.462" offset="7091579">During the decade of the 60’s executions is in the United State dropped to an average of about 20 a year down from a high of almost 200 and an ordinary normal 175 or 150 during previous decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.432" offset="7163364">I should also point out that the number of death sentences returned by juries during the decade of the 60’s and before 1968 is about a 100 year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.399" offset="7223236">Now, what you are talking about is a country where there are 52 jurisdictions competent to impose capital punishment and the population of 200 million people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.126" offset="7262211">43 jurisdiction which actually use the death penalty for some crime and only 100 people convicted of capital punishment and only 20 actually executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.711" offset="7324487">I will -- it will be the court's pleasure to serve the continuation of this theme for the argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1839.002" offset="7429708">The basic issue before the court is of course not whether the death penalty is socially, morally, or politically desirable or advantageous but instead, whether there is some specific provisions in Federal constitution that bars the people of the State of California, in this case from determining through their elected representative, that for death penalty should be available as a possible form punishment would be offense of murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="1912.063" offset="7721966">The petitioner comes here bearing indeed a heavy burden that of establishing that the California legislature lacks any permissible basis upon which to conclude that the protection of the society requires the availability of the death penalty for the most serious of crimes, the willful and malicious taking of human life, that is the punishment of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.917" offset="7829382">A form of punishment is all that the history of man itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.754" offset="7844742">Now, Professor Amsterdam takes the position at least he did 10 ago when he and I were before the California Supreme Court on the very same issue here that even if it could conclusively be established that the death penalty does deter and it saves innocent peoples lives thereby that the death penalty would still be cruel and unusual punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2015.949" offset="8137522">The term as defined from the Wilkerson Case through Francis versus Restwaiver is the definition of cruelty in terms of unnecessary cruelty, unnecessary pain, the want and infliction of pain.</text>

            <text syncTime="2752.823" offset="11084970">I think the petitioner therefore is quite incorrect in stating that if we say that the death penalty is alright, that means just burning in oil and other tortures were necessarily alright too.</text>

            <text syncTime="2829.193" offset="11390498">Now, it is not clear again at which point that petitioner wants us to focus on in determining the standard but one thing is clear he conveniently chooses to ignore the fact if 41 of our 50 State have capital punishment that Federal Government does that eight States have exempted with abolition of the death penalty and rejected it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2926.041" offset="11777842">Keeping in mind their own needs for the protection of their society and most significantly non of those nations have abolished the death penalty judicially, none to my knowledge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3376.741" offset="13580604">So there is no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.737" offset="13588650">It is difficult to understand anything discriminatory and what Professor Amsterdam says that only a small portion of condemned murders receive the death penalty would he prefer that they all do it discretion were abolished, I cannot see how it is unfair that the mass killers like the Manson family, political assassins like Sirhan and a three time killer like Aikens receives the death penalty and some people do not and receive only life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.931" offset="13693453">Now, in conclusion, I would like to state, petitioners offered us no objective standard for what is cruel and unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.743" offset="13720621">He would have this court become a super legislature to enact his own personal views of what the evolving standards of our society should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.480" offset="13755625">Make no showing regarding the supposed lack of protection afforded by the death penalty and if his argument were to prevail, indeed many persons might lose their lives innocently because of the removal of the protection of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.227" offset="13822603">I do not have to dwell at length upon Mr. Aiken's crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.229" offset="13834619">They are concededly by petitioner terribly brutal no remorse, no mental problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.710" offset="13860533">He was intelligent, having education but he committed three brutal murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.782" offset="13880804">So in effect what I would close with is the statement of Justice Homes in the Jackman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.779" offset="13904836">If a thing has been practiced for 200 years with common consent will lead strong case for the Fourteenth Amendment to effect it and Respondent submits that petitioner has not made a strong case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.129" offset="13950185">He has made no case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.395" offset="13959275">Respondent joins the comment that we quoted of Justice Shower, former Justice of the California Supreme Court has all of us involved in the whole process of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.568" offset="14003997">Even if the appellate level to validly wish that the death penalty were no longer necessary but we have not yet reached that utopian state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.025" offset="14037747">Meanwhile putting aside whatever personal feelings we might have nothing has happened in the 180 years history of our constitution or the 300 year history of capital punishment in this country which would preclude the people of the various states from even considering the question, from concluding that society protection requires the availability of the death penalty as s permissible form of punishment in certain of our most aggravated offenses and indeed the cases that we have set forth here indicate that it is the aggravated offense to receive the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.841" offset="14193019">Juries are being discriminating, not discriminatory and petitioner is really seeking to have this court re-litigate what was decided only last year in the McGartha issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.995" offset="14237636">So with that plea, that we consider things on a constitutional level without the emotional rederick of political personal or moral feeling such as to the desirability for death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.082" offset="14293956">We would submit that the judgement should be affirmed in this case and the death penalty is clearly not cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
