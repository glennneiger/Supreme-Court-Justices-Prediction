            <text syncTime="42.417" offset="243636">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.170" offset="258682">I am the attorney for the respondent Earl D. Mosley.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.487" offset="275923">This case is on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and it has been consolidated with the case of Grayned versus the City of Rockford, which is on appeal for the Supreme Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.307" offset="335273">This case concerns a disorderly conduct ordinance of the City of Chicago which prohibits all picketing on a public way within 150 feet of a primary or secondary school.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.649" offset="400580">The ordinance exempts from this prohibition, the picketing of a school involved in a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.081" offset="430359">It became effective on April 5, 1968. Since September, 1967, respondent Earl D. Mosley had picketed Jones Commercial High School, located in the city of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.557" offset="492217">He simply walked in the public sidewalk, adjoining Jones High School, carrying a sign which reflected his belief that Jones High School was discriminating against blacks in its admission policies and in the treatment that are afforded to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.409" offset="559613">It was admitted at trial by the city that at all times Mr. Mosley's activities were peaceful, orderly and quite.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.683" offset="596707">It was further admitted at the trial by petitioners that at no time did Mr. Mosley’s activities in picketing the school by himself or with a few other persons ever caused a disturbance at the school or interfered with traffic around the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.866" offset="661491">After being advised of the passage of this ordinance, Mr. Mosley contacted the Chicago Police Department and was told that he would be arrested, if he continued his activities in picketing Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.763" offset="709033">The city admitted at trial that it intended to enforce this ordinance and in fact Mr. Mosley would be arrested if he continued to picket the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.962" offset="749889">He then filed this declaratory judgment action, seeking a declaratory judgment and an injunction against the enforcement of this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.720" offset="792834">On the grounds that had violated his right to Freedom of Speech and there was a violation of Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.654" offset="820629">The Lower Court after a trial, held that the ordinance was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.002" offset="842049">On appeal, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the ordinance on its face violated Mr. Mosley’s rights to Freedom of Speech, because the ordinance was overly broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.758" offset="905056">This ordinance was a violation of the First Amendment right to Freedom of Speech because it is overly broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.600" offset="936403">The vice of this ordinance is that it sweeps within its prohibition, protected free speech, such as the quite, peaceful picketing of respondent Mr. Mosley.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.593" offset="992410">In fact Mr. Mosley engaged in almost the identical activity as that engaged in by Mr. Thornhill in the case of Thornhill versus Alabama, some 30 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.105" offset="1042460">This Court has held that peaceful picketing is protected free speech and the state can regulate only the abuses of picketing which is articulated as the test of the regulation of the manner of picketing or the purpose of picketing when there is something in the manner or purpose which gives grounds for the dis-allowance of that picketing.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.004" offset="1202016">It must be coupled with something in the manner of picketing or the purpose of picketing which would give grounds for the disallowance of that picketing.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.953" offset="1493856">That statute Your Honor, as the Court noted in the Cox case, was one which specifically dealt with a purpose of picketing and the Court found in that case, that the purpose was legitimate, could legitimately be regulated by the state because the state had a legitimate interest in protecting courts from the undue influence and the interference with the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.081" offset="1594271">The problem with the city of Chicago ordinance is it is not a nearly drafted enactment, that aims specifically at some evil, some abusive picketing.</text>

            <text syncTime="446.795" offset="1861138">In that case the Court went on at great length to note that picketing around a courthouse may cause us an undue and an oppressive influence upon jurors, let us say, who are attending the trial in that particular courthouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.744" offset="1924981">In the hypothetical which Your Honor posed, I would think that someone who picketed a school with the intent to influence the administration of that school to get them to, let’s say, meet more blacks or to afford blacks different treatment such as Mr. Mosley's intent, that would be a legitimate concern on his part and the state would not have an overriding interest in preventing that type of conduct and that type of free speech.</text>

            <text syncTime="495.738" offset="2056952">They both mean of his expressions are Freedom of Speech and that is the problem with this ordinance because what Mr. Mosley was doing, was exercising nothing more than protected free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.238" offset="2102927">The city admits that he never caused the disturbance or interference with the school and yet this ordinance arbitrarily creates a 150-foot limit within which he is prevented from exercising those rights of Freedom of Speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.780" offset="2157158">Now, the city harps over and over in their brief about disturbances and disruptions around schools as a means for justifying this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.304" offset="2195192">But the simple answer to that is that this ordinance is not directed at disturbances, at disruptions or picketing in such a manner as to create disturbances or disruptions around schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.829" offset="6581360">I already have mentioned that I think it violates due notice, because the person cannot know what conduct is prohibited.</text>

            <text syncTime="1646.099" offset="6658369">The other point is that, with respect to 19.2 (a) as this ordinance is drafted, it says that a person who willfully makes the noise or diversion would violate that section and then it seems to modify that which disturbs or tends to disturb the peace and good order of the school session.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.986" offset="6737990">I submit that what is happening is that the person is being convicted when he makes a noise or diversion and his intent is just to make the noise or diversion not to disturb or disturb the peace of good order of the school.</text>

            <text syncTime="1909.263" offset="7710999">The issues of this case as viewed by the city of Chicago are three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.831" offset="7729285">Does the claim of a free man to use the streets as a public forum exclude even modest regulations as to the time and place within which his rights maybe exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.138" offset="7782575">Two, if modest regulations are permissible in protecting substantial governmental interest, is Chicago in error in ascribing such importance to its schools and three, is the Chicago ordinance void by reason of being over broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.664" offset="7848612">The city of Chicago believes that the rule of this case ought to answer each question in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.289" offset="7871182">The ordinance before the Court is at partial restriction as to picketing and demonstrating around elementary and secondary schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.302" offset="7903156">Reasonable as to time, that is during classes and a half hour before and after, and reasonable I submit as to place, that is within 150 feet of the school building.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.420" offset="7951639">When local government is attempting to harmonize and accommodate, conflicting demands for the use of streets, the standards as to time and place or every bit as relevant as the controls upon manner and purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.069" offset="8014229">This ordinance ought not to be viewed as a ban on First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.984" offset="8033977">It is clearly and properly, a phrasing or timing of the activities in recognition, that at a certain time and within a certain limited area, there does exist competing interest which the city may rightly acknowledge and regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.722" offset="8108896">The purpose of the ordinances and the reason for its passage and the reason for the phasing and timing contained in it, is that the city sought to impose a very simple ordinance on school picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.475" offset="8163858">The city council sought to assure that school kids have a setting for education where tranquility, order, calm and quite might prevail or at least not be minimized by introducing picketing or demonstrating in a customary counterparts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.928" offset="8237732">Adderley versus Florida tells us, that there maybe some public places which are so clearly committed to other purposes, that their use for airing grievances is anomalous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.462" offset="8287887">In Adderley, it was the private drive way to the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.522" offset="8304083">In Cox versus Louisiana, it was near a courthouse and in Cameron versus Johnson, it was access to public buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.797" offset="8341177">Chicago believes that the school house ought to receive similar insulation from what has been traditionally described as speech plus activities, while classes are in session.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.891" offset="8401572">The ordinance in Chicago was passed in response to widespread and ugly demonstrations, which were taking place on the daily basis at elementary schools, where black students were being bused for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.015" offset="8466042">The respondent Mosley would have this Court believe that an ordinance with such a derivation was nearly ploy for stifling his cry for a larger black enrollment at Jones Commercial High School.</text>

            <text syncTime="2737.993" offset="11025938">However when we're talking about motivation, the counsel provides us, the fact is that there could be a question under Fourteenth Amendment and the discriminatory provisions of the labor dispute exemption, there could be and the city of Rockford, the city counsel felt as incidentally to other city counsels and other school boards throughout the length of this country that if that is the problem, we will delete and we did delete the labor dispute exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="3354.988" offset="13493987">As to the definition of diversion, I believe the Illinois Supreme Court took that up, specifically the word itself and I hope I can find it immediately or in -- it said, we do observe while the defendant charges that the terms appearing in the ordinance such as noise and diversion -- I am reading from the Illinois Supreme Court opinion, lack of constitutional precision and are two indefinite common terms such as alarmed, disturbed, interfered with and hindered, have been determined to comply with the constitutional requirements of Mississippi.</text>
