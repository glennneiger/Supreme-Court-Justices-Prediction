            <label>Mr. Arnold Bauman</label>
            <text syncTime="36.927" offset="221390">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.410" offset="239362">This case appears in this Court as a result of a grant of certiorari to review the affirmance of judgments by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals which affirmed a motion of the District Court, dismissing the complaint in this case, on the basis that the complaint did not present an instance of Federal jurisdiction under Rule 17 of the Security Act of 1933 or Rule 10 and, I beg your pardon, Section 10 and Rule 10 (b) 5 of the Security Act of 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.148" offset="394321">As I am certain, the Court is aware, I shall say, merely very briefly that Section 17 (a) of the 1933 Act deals with the usage of interstate facilities of interstate commerce in connection with the stock frauds involved in the purchase of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.750" offset="472688">Section 10 (b) which is reproduced at page 3 of our brief as well as Rule 10 (b) (5) was later passed, a year later, and I respectfully urge upon the Court that it was passed to cover the loopholes, to make up for the loopholes which Congress left when it passed Section 17 (a) of the 1933 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.174" offset="562340">Now, I should like merely to refer to one part of Section 10 (b) because it is at the crux and at the center of the argument that I intend to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.393" offset="607271">Section 10 of course states that “it shall be unlawful for anyone by use of means of interstate commerce to use or employ any deceptive device,” and of course I am leaving up irrelevant words, “in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or,” or and I shall come to the reason for that emphasis, “for the protection of investors.”</text>
            <text syncTime="172.542" offset="763901">I think I can say now before I discuss the facts with the Court that the reason I stressed the “or” in Rule 10 (b) (5) is because I respectfully submit that the Court below, both Courts below, Judge Herlings (ph) in the District Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, both tended to read the protection, the words “in the public interest” as synonymous with the “protection of investors.”</text>
            <text syncTime="201.329" offset="879049">And I respectfully submit to this Court that when rule was promulgated, the exchange had in mind, I beg your pardon, when that Section was passed, the Congress had in mind a different test for that which is alleged to have been in the public interest from that which is necessary for the protection of investors.</text>

            <text syncTime="233.186" offset="1006422">Your honor, I was just this moment coming to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.726" offset="1020633">I was about to say that Rule 10 (b) (5) presents or gives rise to the second or another one of the issues in this case, in that it in effect paraphrases Section 17 (a), but then adds as Mr. Justice Brennan has called to my attention, in his very last words, that it prohibits unlawful actions in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.501" offset="1143722">Now, the Court of Appeals and I should like to use part of my time to discuss the facts with the Court because I think they are very important in this case, but in order to put it in focus, I would like to submit that the Court of Appeals felt that where a securities transaction is pure in itself, in other words, securities worth X dollars are sold for X dollars, even though that is part of an -- and an integral part, indeed a -- an absolutely necessary part of an overall fraudulent scheme to fact that neither the securities transaction was impure nor were the processes of a marketplace, solely to use the words of the opinion below, that in such a case as long as the -- as the securities transaction is pure, the Court below felt that it was not “in connection with a securities transaction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="330.845" offset="1397109">Now, with the Court's permission I should like to address myself to the facts of this case because as I say in my view they are -- they are that important.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.085" offset="1442040">I should say at the very first that I appear as a representative of the Superintendent of Insurances of the State of New York who as a result of the transactions which I am about to relate was appointed liquidator of Manhattan Casualty Company, a New York Insurance Company and of course the liquidator was appointed by the Supreme Court of the State of New York and functions under an order of such appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.406" offset="1563353">Until January 24, 1962, Bankers Life was the sole stockholder of Manhattan Casualty Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.122" offset="1606193">On that day Bankers sold its Manhattan stock to a group consisting of a man named Bourne and another man named Begole, who had no money at all as will come out in a moment, for five million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.788" offset="1680799">It had previously been arranged with the Irving Trust Company that at the closing of this Manhattan Stock, Irving would appear with the check for five million dollars and at the closing, at the sale from Bankers Life to Bourne and Begole, a representative, an officer of Irving Trust did in fact appear with a check made up in the sum of five million dollars payable to Bankers Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.120" offset="1782154">This was delivered at the -- at the closing. I should point out that in this point of time and indeed to the best of my knowledge, until after the close of business on January 24th, 1962, Manhattan casualty had no account to them, nonetheless, Irving did issue this check of five million to Bankers Life obviously to pay for the stock which was being transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.204" offset="1902526">Shortly after the closing of the stock, a new Board was elected and the Board convened.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.925" offset="1969400">It was represented, and I believe the record best indicates that it was represented at that meeting by the Chairman of the Board, new Board of Manhattan, the man Begole whom I previously made reference as a purchaser that Manhattan's portfolio of Government Securities, US Government Bonds and Securities totaling some $4,854,000.00 was an undesirable investment from the point of view of the corporation and recommended to the Board of Directors that in order to bet at the corporate position, these bonds should be sold and the money invested in a certificate of deposit.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.122" offset="2174200">The Board of Directors, believing that the sale of its portfolio of Government Securities totaling almost some five million dollars was so going to be altered, voted a resolution relying on the misrepresentations of the Chairman, authorizing the sale of the portfolio of Manhattan's government funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="820.888" offset="3357233">As to the sale of the government securities, the Court of Appeals fragmented the fact situation here, did not look at the actual fraud but said as I indicated to the Court before that since the stock transaction itself was pure, since value was received by the company and true value for these government bonds, all you have here is a misappropriation of proceeds of the sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="946.124" offset="3858157">Indeed in the brief, we cite the cases, most recent one of which is Bails (ph) and going back to Hooper which is a landmark case of the Fifth Circuit, which has dealt with this problem over and over and over again and I respectfully suggest that a reading of those cases will show that it has consistently permitted a representative of creditors, a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver, a person like the liquidator who presumably does precisely the same thing as those gentlemen do, except that because it is an insurance company it is covered by State Law, and so I would suggest that Birnbaum should be extended to include such a person in the interest of the creditors which I suggest are in the interest --</text>

            <text syncTime="1515.297" offset="6134886">One, that the Board of Directors was deceived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.150" offset="6162262">Two, that $4,800,000 worth of Manhattan's Securities was sold as a direct result of that deception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.817" offset="6224956">Three, the corporation gave up five million dollars in securities and got nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.564" offset="6267901">Now, both Judge Herlings in the District Court and that I believe the United States Circuit Court for the Second Circuit held and as to that transaction and that series of transactions there was no question of my standing to sue or the liquidator’s standing to sue because Manhattan was in fact the seller of security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.939" offset="6365495">It was in connection with the transaction involving the sale of the Manhattan shares between Bankers Life and the buyers that they invoked the Birnbaum doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1786.944" offset="7221475">It was a case in which because it was a common law conversion and their sole stockholder was the one who caused it, Judge Zwack felt that he had ratified the fraud and therefore there was no cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.018" offset="7337772">It did not attempt to interpret 10 (b) (5) and there were no allegations of deceit on the Board of Directors of that corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1902.964" offset="7685514">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.701" offset="7700456">The commission is grateful for the opportunity to participate in this argument before and today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.742" offset="7724698">You have, on many occasions permitted us to file amicus briefs, but participation of the argument means even more to us now, try to make good use of the time you have awarded us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.812" offset="7760956">I like to start in substantially where the counsel for the petitioner left off on this question of fragmentation which is, in my way of thinking the thing that caused the Court below to go wrong and is the point at which the argument is now made by the opposition in support to that result is also erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.365" offset="7859176">On pages two and three of our briefs, we quote both Section 17 from the 1933 Act which has the anti fraud provision there and Section 10 (b) in Rule 10 (b) (5) from the 1934 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.633" offset="7912257">And I direct the Court’s attention to this difference between the two which I say the Court below overlooked entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.084" offset="7946007">Section 17 (a) says it shall be unlawful for any person in the offer or sale of any security by use of interstate so on and so forth to employ fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.525" offset="7987803">In other words, the fraud must be in the offer or sale of any security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.538" offset="8007865">Whereas in the 1934 Act, the requirement is not that the fraud be right inside of the sale or purchase itself, but that it be in connection with the purchase or sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.770" offset="8052796">Now, you are not ascribing anything, any meaning at all to those words and that difference between these two statutes, if your rule as a Court below did, that there is not a case stated under 10 (b) from 10 (b) (5) in this case then I would direct your attention at the bottom of page three and the top of page four, to the fact that Rule 10 (b) (5) has three sub paragraphs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.183" offset="8150389">I submit that the Court below refused to take any cognizance of sub paragraphs one and three of that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.636" offset="8188215">They fragmented this thing down to the point where they refused to look at it as an overall scheme device or artifice to the fraud, which is the words used in sub paragraph one or to look upon it as sub paragraph three says “as engaging in an act, practice or course of business which operates as a fraud or a deceit upon any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.657" offset="8280270">They analyzed this case solely in terms of the second paragraph of the second sub paragraph of Rule 10 (b) (5) and even there, took an unduly limited and restricted view of it because it says “that it should be unlawful to make any untrue statement of material facts or to omit those state -- a material fact in connection with purchase or sale of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.147" offset="8386327">As counsel has already said, there is abundant evidence that they did misrepresent to the directors and they did fail to disclose to the directors their true intention as to what they are going to do with the proceeds of this sale of bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.487" offset="8439617">Remember that earlier in the day, going to the bank and got a five million dollar check written with nothing behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.678" offset="8468456">They obviously had to be intending to convert the proceeds of the sale of the bonds in order to cover the check and that is exactly what they did, and they deceived the directors in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.792" offset="8504819">So I say that the Court, by refusing to look at the thing in that sort of a way, and by refusing to connect that one sale of Government bonds, which by the way is the particulars of the transaction that the government relies on in this case, they refused to look upon that as a part of an overall scheme and the other parts of which were also essential to this scheme and all of which should be considered as a package, not as individual fragmented facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2192.725" offset="8844619">The reason that we did not dwell upon the sale of Manhattan’s own stock from Bankers Life to the defrauders as a part of our case is because that runs directly contrary to Birnbaum which says that the defrauded party must be either a purchaser or a seller, well of course Manhattan itself did not sell anything or buy anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="2255.326" offset="9094977">Let me read you just two sentences, his opinion is only a page-and-a-half long, as reprinted in the appendix on pages 109 and 110, just two sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.467" offset="9135519">He says Manhattan was the victim of a “scheme to defraud,” which is the language of the of rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.983" offset="9161642">Since the vital center of the scheme, the vehicle for the perpetration of the fraud was the sale of Manhattan’s stock, it seems to me to be completely unrealistic to say that the fraud was committed “in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.369" offset="9231127">Well, now Judge Hayes knows just as well as any of us here in the room do, that the sale of Manhattan's stock did not involve Manhattan as either a purchaser or as a seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.137" offset="9282223">And he is saying in so many words that when you have got an overall scheme to defraud, you do not fragment it to look at the overall scheme and if any part of it was in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, that is the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.732" offset="9328616">The answer does apply in the question of whether the plaintiff himself happened to be a purchaser or a seller and it seems to me that anything short of that simply overlooks the difference in wording between Section 17 of the 1933 Act and Section 10 (b) and Rule 10 (b) (5) or the 1934 Act because the one says it must be in connection with the sale or as the other -- the one says it must be in the sale or in the purchase, whereas the other says that it has to be in connection with a purchase or sale by any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.089" offset="9474066">I would like to deal, just a moment with this question of whether we are pursuing a purely self inflicted fraud that really did not hurt anybody because Mr. Begole or Mr. Begole and Bourne themselves were the sole owners of this corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.270" offset="9558807">That kind of a position of course overlooks the community of interest which a corporation represents over and beyond the interest of the stockholder or stockholder alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.312" offset="9602902">If you had, for example a corporation that had outstanding bonds or debentures or other form of debt securities, you certainly would not say that they want, that that interest was not to be protected and likewise the interest of other creditors and policy holders is all a part of the overall community that the statute is designed to present to protect, not just to protect alone the shareholder, who in this case was the sole shareholder who was the one who perpetrated the fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="2547.033" offset="10261815">The leading case that does come under the Federal Securities Laws is the Hooper versus Mountain State's case and in there it was plainly held even though the corporation itself was controlled by the person who committed the fraud, the fact did not mean that there could not be recovery for the benefit of creditors or anybody else who had dealt with the corporation in reliance on the Court with transaction and the Bail's case which is referred to here earlier is to the same effect and it is so recent that this does not even appear on our brief, it was decided since our brief was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.612" offset="10408100">And I think it is important in this connection to note that Congress at the very time it was drafting this statute had in mind, in relation to insurance companies, the fact that creditors and policy holders could be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.120" offset="10466197">The House Report, I am paraphrasing or quoting now on facts away from the footnote in page 27 of our brief, the House report on the bill which became the 1934 Act noted that over 15 million individuals hold insurance policies, the values of which is dependent upon the security holdings of insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.096" offset="10546027">That is quoted exactly from the House Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.566" offset="10563999">The Senate Report went on to observe that the current value of securities held by insurance companies and consequently the welfare of the countless individuals who have a financial interest in such institutions is directly effected by the activities, he is talking now about his activities in the trading and sale of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.646" offset="10632231">So while it can be said that Congress was not perhaps directly concerned with creditors and policy holders as such to the extent that part of the community of interest that makes up an insurance company is creditors and policy holders that is a part of what Congress was directing itself to when it enacted the anti fraud provisions of the 1934 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2837.522" offset="11423741">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.284" offset="11438788">Plaintiff's basic contention here is that a claim under the Federal Securities Laws is stated because Manhattan's sole shareholder misappropriated Manhattan's funds insofar as the proceeds from the sale of Manhattan's bonds were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.404" offset="11527290">There are at least two reasons why plaintiff is wrong in asserting that Manhattan has any claim under Federal Law in connection with this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.458" offset="11583506">First, there was no deception of or damage to Manhattan because Manhattan's sole shareholder knew of, participated in, benefited from and fully ratified the allegedly fraudulent transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.020" offset="11673785">Since Manhattan, by way of its sole shareholder could not have been deceived, suffered no damage, there was no Federal fraud in connection with the sale of any security, either the Manhattan bonds or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.514" offset="11747764">Now, Mr. Bowman and Mr. North have suggested that there is something to a corporation other than its shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.050" offset="11785903">I would suggest that it is standard corporate law that when shareholders fully ratify the action taken by a corporation, that becomes corporate action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.581" offset="11840028">Now, it may be that such action would constitute a fraud on creditors, as long established common law in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.288" offset="11886840">If corporate insiders by their actions with regard to the corporation in someway damage creditors, creditors have remedies at common law and by statute in all of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.981" offset="11957579">They have remedies by way of an action for fraudulent conveyance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.280" offset="11974820">They have actions by way of, an action for illegal dividend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.076" offset="11998017">There was no need for Congress to provide creditor remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.549" offset="12015885">Those remedies already were available to creditors and I suggest that if you have sole stockholder approval of an action, certainly under Federal Law and in Federal Securities Law, there can be no fraud on the corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3011.307" offset="12118912">Your Honor, if I may be very frank about the reason why we are here today, and quite frankly I am glad I am here today because I think this is an important issue of law because Chief Judge Ryan invited the defendants to make a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.048" offset="12197906">If I may tell you quite frankly what tactics of defense counsel was on this case, we were going to take it through the trial in the Federal Courts and then get the case dismissed, because we did not think that there was a Federal claim here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.648" offset="12252241">We went all the way through years of pre-trial discovery, thousands of pages of testimonies, hundreds of documents. Chief Judge Ryan, when Mr. Parker made a motion for summary judgment, refused to decide the motion for summary judgment on its merits, stating that in his view, the complaint did not spell out a claim and suggested to counsel that a motion to dismiss be made, because he felt that this was not a federal action and that the Federal Courts in the Southern District of New York should not have to go through a trial that will take weeks, if not months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.943" offset="12405423">We made that motion to dismiss, pursuant to the suggestion of Judge Ryan and we were sustained in our relief all the way up to this Court that there is no federal claim here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.389" offset="12451294">Now, in response to Judge Blackmun's question as to why we prefer to be in the state courts, we do not necessarily prefer to be in the state courts, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.722" offset="12988580">The first five million dollar check, the one payable to Bankers Life and Casualty Company which constituted the payment by Mr. Begole for a stock, was delivered by the Irving officer to the Bankers Life representative at the closing as a convenience to Mr. Garvin who was one of the leading members of the New York Brokerage Community.</text>

            <text syncTime="3310.401" offset="13315320">It was convenience to Mr. Garvin.</text>

            <text syncTime="3328.486" offset="13387627">After the first transaction, namely the closing at Manhattan had taken place, Mr. Gunter got back to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.464" offset="13423571">He received a telephone call from Mr. Garvin and he said that there was a second half to the transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3384.153" offset="13610295">There was an attempt to indicate to the court that there was a nice, clean cut arrangement whereby you had a morning transaction and an afternoon transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.855" offset="13653135">The facts in this case are not that simple and I would refer Your Honors for a detail in statement of them to the appendix in my brief where we do try to take you step by step through these complex transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.765" offset="13704753">In response to your question, Mr. Chief Justice Brennan, when Mr. Gunter went to Belgian-American in the afternoon, the government bonds of Manhattan had not yet been sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.260" offset="13766716">Certainly, the amount for which they were sold had not yet been indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.526" offset="13787823">The way that this operated was that the Government bond transaction, the sale of government bonds was a private transaction between Manhattan casualty and Second District Securities, a large bond house in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.524" offset="13855741">The bonds were gradually delivered to Second District and notices came for Second District, during the course of the day and on into the evening as to the amount which was being paid for the bonds, that the amount being paid for the bonds depended on the going rate for those bonds at that particular time of delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.618" offset="13944139">So, during the entire course of the day, afternoon and into the evening, and I might say that Mr. Gunter’s responsibilities was in the security clearance division on the bank, the securities clearance division has to do with receipt of securities and payment for securities and literally, hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions are dealt with everyday by Irving Trust Company alone in this particular division of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.314" offset="14050928">So when Mr. Gunter went home that evening, which was, as I recall the testimony in the pretrial, eight or nine o’clock, he still was not sure exactly how much had been received for the securities during the course of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.751" offset="14112682">I might also say that and as I have been pointed out to Your Honors, the bonds ultimately produced only $4,800,000 odd dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.309" offset="14166912">A $150,000.00 check of Manhattan drawn on another bank was delivered to Irving sometime during the late afternoon of January 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.972" offset="14217589">That check was payable to the order of Manhattan Casualty Company and that check constituted a credit to Manhattan's account at Irving and in fact that is exactly what form it took, the Manhattan check, drawn in another bank, payable to itself for $150,000.00, was credited to Manhattan's account at Irving.</text>

            <text syncTime="3639.342" offset="14631055">Now it turned out, however, that when the documentation of what had gone on during the course of the day started to come into the bank and it started to come in on January 24, Mr. Gunter gathered that he had misunderstood what the true situation was and made the entries which complied with the written instructions which he was receiving from various people.</text>

            <text syncTime="3670.154" offset="14754353">Mr. Gunter received sometime during the course of the day on January 24, a letter from Manhattan Casualty Company signed by Mr. Sweeny as President of Manhattan, instructing Irving to transfer five million dollars from Manhattan's account at Irving to Belgian-American.</text>

            <text syncTime="4072.361" offset="16363183">Here once again sir, I was going to our strategy, which possibly is something I should not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.775" offset="16388783">Quite frankly, I do not believe that my opponent is happy in the New York State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.606" offset="16412084">He has much more experience in the Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.774" offset="16424832">He is more familiar with finding his way around the Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.395" offset="16443326">Rightly or wrongly, that is the conclusion we have reached, that he would be unhappier in the State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.581" offset="16476032">It is not a question of where we would be happy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.661" offset="16512290">To return to the question of the Congressional intent, Congress did not intend, by the enactment of the Securities Laws to create Federal Law which would govern every corporate management transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.544" offset="16591911">Absent the compelling reasons, it would seem inappropriate to inject the anti-fraud doctrine of Rule 10 (b) (5) into a case where the unique question is the fiduciary duty owed by a sole shareholder to his corporation and its creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.185" offset="16682399">Once again, I emphasize, Your Honors that State Common and Statutory Law have long provided adequate remedies for whatever creditors there may be in this picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.678" offset="16728375">And with regard to the creditors, Your Honor, let me say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.288" offset="16746869">At the time of the liquidation, all of the policy holders of Manhattan were re-insured, so those policy holders are no longer in the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.024" offset="16785739">Insofar as any other creditors are concerned, we have strained through years of pre-trail discovery, to find out if in fact any creditor exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.295" offset="16830879">We have yet to be given any concrete information as to whether there is in fact any creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.908" offset="16861286">Now, once again I emphasize to Your Honors that even if there are creditors, the creditors are perfectly capable of having their remedy by way of the long established State remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.293" offset="16922830">Mr. Bowman is bringing an action in the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.533" offset="16935787">There is the place, under the State Law to look into the situation to see whether there are creditors and if there are creditors, to provide the proper remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.523" offset="16987823">There is no reason why the Federal Courts, by way of an implied cause of action under section 10 (b), should preempt this entire well developed area of State Law of creditor's rights, when it is clear from the realm of the Securities Acts as a whole that Congress did not so intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.047" offset="17073922">It should be left to Congress to decide whether the enforcement of a substantial part of what is now a corporate law should be assumed by the Federal Courts, and I might say in this respect, Your Honors that Congress has not been delinquent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.778" offset="17132855">Congress is constantly analyzing the Securities Acts to decide whether there should be amendments there too.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.001" offset="17161694">There are hearings going on across the street at the present time with regard to the possible amendment to the Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.970" offset="17189593">There are also hearings going on with regard to the proper division of jurisdiction between the Federal and the State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.779" offset="17220835">I suggest that this is something that should be left to Congress to analyze and by way of carefully held hearings, determine to what extent Congress wants to take over general Corporate Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4303.495" offset="17287708">The petitioner and the Commission, in urging this Court to reverse the decision of the Courts below are in effect asking if an extension of Rule 10 (b) (5) far beyond any other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.009" offset="17353746">They are in effect, asking this Court to hope that an alleged act of corporate mismanagement which does not involve a manipulation or deception intrinsic to the security transaction, to be a Federal wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.092" offset="17426053">Such an extension of the coverage of the Securities Act is not necessary in order to carry out with Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.681" offset="17456459">I know that Your Honors have held, in prior cases, that the Securities Acts should be broadly construed so as to carry out the Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.817" offset="17497002">I happen to whole heartedly agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.037" offset="17513824">I also whole heartedly agree that there should be a private course of action under Section 10 (b), but I do not believe that Section 10 (b) should be construed in such a way as to bring within the scope a Federal Jurisdiction, matters which Congress never intended, the Federal Courts to exercise jurisdiction over.</text>
            <text syncTime="4383.212" offset="17606507">Judge Herlings, in dismissing the complaint herein, not only examined the complaint, but he examined the entire pre-trial record which was years in the making.</text>
            <text syncTime="4398.842" offset="17669096">After taking the motion to dismiss under advisement for over nine months, he came up with his, what I believe to be, well considered opinion and his well reasoned opinion, in which he concluded that under the unique facts in this action, you did not have a Federal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.089" offset="17770033">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed Judge Herlings and I might say also that possibly because Judge Herlings came through with a lengthy opinion, we forget Judge Ryan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.266" offset="17814755">Not only was a motion to dismiss made before Judge Herlings, but a similar motion was made before Judge Ryan, who also considered the matter in excess of nine months and then came out with an opinion, agreeing with Judge Herlings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4452.952" offset="17885495">The Court of Appeals affirmed the opinions of both Judge Herlings and Judge Ryan and I think it's a matter of general knowledge, that it is the second Circuit, which after all has had to give the consideration to most of the Securities Acts cases and I think it is fair to say that Second Circuit has uniformly, broadly interpreted the Securities Act cases before so as to provide a remedy when one is necessary to carry out the Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.951" offset="18021540">As Judge Herling stated below, this is another of many of the recurring cases in which the question basically is, does the plaintiff belong in the State Courts or has he spelled out a federal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4501.757" offset="18080682">This case, once again, I emphasize, involves a misappropriation of corporate assets by a sole shareholder or the corporation, involves no injury to any public investor, involves no purchase of sale of any security for less than its spare value and it had no effect whatsoever on any securities market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.566" offset="18172006">On these unique facts, I suggest, Your Honors, that plaintiff has stated no federal claim and that he should pursue his remedy in the State Court action which was brought against the same plaintiffs, based on the same facts and in which he asked for the same damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4544.528" offset="18251836">If I may Your Honors, with just a few questions posed this morning for Mr. Bowman, which I might respond to, I believe Mr. Justice White asked how the bonds were sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="4558.227" offset="18306588">I believe I have responded to that that it was a private sale, transaction between Manhattan and Second District Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="4566.451" offset="18339503">Once again, there are no security market was involved, no public exchange was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.874" offset="18389240">If I may go to this question of creditor standing, under the Securities Laws, it is my position that Congress did not intend to provide any rights under the Security Laws to creditors as a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="4600.589" offset="18476071">The Securities Laws, if you read them from the beginning to the end were composed to provide remedies to security holders, to purchasers and sellers of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.446" offset="18535526">Once again, I suggest there was no need to provide a remedy to creditors because creditors already had adequate remedy in the State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.506" offset="18571679">I would suggest that if you look at the Field versus Lue case, you will see, and which was referred to by Mr. Bowman and which is cited at length in my brief, you will see that it is very relevant to the issue before, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.189" offset="18630402">What Field versus Lue does is to analyze what a corporation is and in that case, it was concluded by the District Court that when the sole stockholder of a corporation ratifies and participates in a corporate transaction, it is corporate action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.696" offset="18720473">The corporation they are asked -- thereafter has no remedy against the sole stockholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.332" offset="18747013">The remedy of any creditor who is damaged is by way of an action for fraudulent conveyance or some similar type of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.893" offset="18781286">Now, if the situation has resulted in a trustee and bankruptcy being appointed under the bankruptcy law, then I think the Field case clearly demonstrates the division of responsibility that a trustee and bankruptcy has.</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.812" offset="18836979">A trustee and bankruptcy can sue on behalf of the corporation and it can sue on behalf of the creditor, but I suggest that what was happening in Field was that the trustee and bankruptcy, the plaintiff there was being told that because of the ratification of the actions by the sole stockholder, he had no cause of action on behalf of the corporation, that does not mean he does not have a cause of action on behalf of the creditors but to carry that analysis into this case, if in fact what Mr. Bowman is doing, he is suing on behalf of creditors, then I suggest that under the Birnbaum doctrine, he has no standing to sue because the creditors are not purchasers or sellers of a security and I suggest, Your Honors that Birnbaum, not only is law in the Second Circuit, it is law in all of the circuits which have carefully considered the question and I think rightfully should remain the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="4759.435" offset="19111473">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.089" offset="19138014">I appear principally in the interest of respondent Bankers Life and Casualty Company as to whom the facts and the proceedings in this case are unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.141" offset="19198304">However, this Court may interpret Section 10 (b) of the 1934 Act and Rule 10 (b) (5) promulgated there under, petitioner has not and he cannot state a claim for which relief can be granted against Bankers Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.800" offset="19280851">Neither the complaint itself nor the complaint supplemented by a comprehensive discovery record provides a single, factual allegation which in any respect supports any claim against Bankers Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.855" offset="19357129">The only conceivable reason that Bankers Life was made a party to the action and is here today is that it happened to own the stock of Manhattan Casualty Company and sold it in January 1962 after months of negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.205" offset="19442497">The sale was arms length and the only conclusion which the record permits is that the sale was free from any impropriety in any respect whatsoever on the part of Bankers Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.193" offset="19514490">In November 1963, shortly after the action was commenced and the insurance department had completed a lengthy investigation into the circumstances which led to the liquidation of Manhattan, the petitioner, the Superintendent of Insurance, as liquidator of Manhattan was deposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4883.365" offset="19607173">Upon deposition, the essence of the petitioner's testimony was that he could not assert any facts to justify inclusion of Bankers Life as a party in any way connected with any of the alleged wrongs upon which the action was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.185" offset="19686481">The other speculative basis upon which Bankers Life was named a party was clearly revealed by the petitioner's testimonial admission that he could not factually support any claim against Bankers Life and to attempt to do so, he required an opportunity to conduct discovery proceedings and so petitioner proceeded to discover.</text>
            <text syncTime="4930.591" offset="19796090">By early 1968, petitioner concluded some four and one half years of discovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="4991.977" offset="20041642">In any event, in April 1968, Bankers Life moved before the District Court for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56, on the ground that there was no trivial issue of fact as to Bankers Life and it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5009.203" offset="20110500">Bankers Life was the only defendant who so moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.714" offset="20128577">When the motion was made, the petitioner indicated his need for, and he obtained sufficient time within which to search the discovery record in the hope that he could find something upon which to base an opposition to that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5031.013" offset="20197749">The motion was heard upon extensive and comprehensive affidavits before Judge Sylvester Ryan, who found that petitioner had no way charged that Bankers Life had participated in the negotiations for the raising of the purchase price for the Manhattan stock or even that Bankers Life had any knowledge of those negotiations and Judge Ryan's exact words are at page 42 A of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="5058.683" offset="20308404">Nevertheless, Judge Ryan denied the summary judgment motion, but he did so expressly stating that it was not on the merits and it was without prejudice and he explained that he could not dispose of the motion because of the need first to determine petitioner's questionable claim of Federal jurisdiction and so the motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction were made and it is as a result of the dismissal of the complaint and its affirmance by the Court of Appeals that the respondents who made such motions are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.387" offset="20463258">As to bankers Life, it simply is not involved in the questions presented whether there was schemes or devices employed by others in connection with any transactions complained of by the petitioner or relied upon by the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="5116.956" offset="20541521">The absence of any connection of Bankers Life with any schemes or devices was confirmed by petitioner's attorney in open court as long ago as November 1963, First referring to the fact of the sale of the Manhattan stock, petitioner's attorney describing his claim stated and I quote, “thereafter the complaint alleges that defendants, other than Mr. Parker's client, namely Bankers Life, entered into a scheme to cover up this depletion of corporate assets which was successful for about a year-and-a-half.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.340" offset="20707033">Since the time that statement was made, petitioner has been unable to alter the admitted lack of any connection between any of the transactions complained of in Bankers Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="5171.270" offset="20758755">The conclusion set forth at page 37 of petitioner's main brief, plainly evidences that the heart of his purported Federal claim is based upon the circumstances of the sale of the Manhattan Government bonds and the misappropriation of the proceeds of that sale with none of which Bankers Life had any connection whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="5195.219" offset="20854572">These transactions occurred after the purchaser had acquired the stock, had taken control of the company and had installed a Board of Directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.871" offset="20901175">It was petitioner's own analysis of his complaint, supplemented by the extensive discovery record, which led Judge Ryan to the conclusion that I have mentioned before, namely, that there was no charge in this entire record, whatsoever made, that Bankers Life participated in or even had any knowledge of the transactions relating to the raising of the purchase price for the Manhattan stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="5234.725" offset="21012561">The absence of any basis for asserting any Federal claim against Bankers Life is also confirmed by petitioner's reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5243.390" offset="21047251">First, as to the brief of Bankers Life; the principal point of the brief of Bankers Life is that no Federal claim has been asserted against Bankers Life and that Federal jurisdiction does not exist as to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5275.946" offset="21177446">As to the petitioner's reply brief, he has not, in any respect controverted this inescapable conclusion that there is no Federal jurisdiction as to Bankers Life or that dismissal of the complaint was unquestionably correct as to Bankers Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="5292.625" offset="21244215">Nevertheless, we believe that the judgment below should be affirmed in all respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="5299.087" offset="21270024">We believe further that in any event, that judgment should certainly be affirmed as to Bankers Life.</text>
            <text syncTime="5306.911" offset="21301370">When the Court of Appeals sir, and I think I can anticipate your question because I will not overlook it, when the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit was presented with a similar situation, involving multiple defendants in Schoenbaum against Firstbrook which is reported at 405, F. 2nd at 215, a case involving Rule 10 (b) (5), a case which was heard en banc, that court affirmed dismissal of the complaint for lack of jurisdiction in respect of that single defendant as to whom there was no showing made of any participation in the wrongs complained of.</text>
