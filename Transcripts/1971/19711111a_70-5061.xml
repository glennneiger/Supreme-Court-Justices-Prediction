            <text syncTime="82.748" offset="404647">On February 20th, 1968, at about 4:30 in the afternoon, Willie Shard was walking down a street in Chicago, when he noticed two men following about 15 feet behind him.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.457" offset="463475">He however, paid no particular attention to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.728" offset="480611">As he turned to enter a restaurant, a man grabbed him from behind, while another man took from his pocket, $30 or $35 in cash, $145 in traveler’s checks, his wallet and all his Identification papers.</text>

            <text syncTime="124.563" offset="571935">It was not until the next day that Shard notified the police and gave them a general description of the height, weight and complexion of the two men. Two days later, on February 22nd, at about 11 in the morning, Thomas Kirby, the petitioner in this action, and Ralph Bean were walking down on a street in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.130" offset="674231">At the same time two Chicago police officers, the Isaac Panapinto and James Reesy (ph) were cruising in a unmarked squad car.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.540" offset="711847">Officer Panapinto (ph) remarked to his partner that Kirby resembled Alfonso Hampton, a man supposedly wanted by the Chicago Police for perpetrating a crap game.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.879" offset="753225">The officers then stopped the two men.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.175" offset="770361">When asked for his identification, Kirby pulled out his wallet and as he pulled out his wallet, the officers noticed traveler’s check bearing the name Willie Shard.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.706" offset="808500">When asked to whom these checks belonged, Kirby responded that they were play money or that he had won them in a crap game, the officers then searched Bean and found identification papers bearing the name Willie Shard.</text>

            <text syncTime="204.963" offset="893555">It was not until after they returned to the police station and had checked police records that the officers first learned that this robbery and that fact is I think it is incontestable in this matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.280" offset="986760">I am just trying to piece together this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.657" offset="1004314">I mean one of these people arrested, the petitioner might have been named Willie Shard, is that not correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="238.852" offset="1029078">That is possible Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.976" offset="1037542">We argued probable cause for arrest in the Illinois appellate court --(Voice Overlap)</text>
            <text syncTime="249.900" offset="1073277">When the men were taken to the police station, the officer, after learning that Willie Shard had been robbed, telephoned Shard and told them that they had the two suspects, whom they wanted him to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.822" offset="1137016">Another officer was sent to pick up Shard.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.373" offset="1151122">When Shard arrived at the police station, Kirby and Bean being, who happened to be black proceeded between officers Panapinto and Reesy in a large squad room.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.853" offset="1197098">When Shard enter the room, the officers asked him if these were the two men.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.426" offset="1215384">Shard responded affirmatively.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.417" offset="1231370">No lineup was ever held in this case, this was the only identification that took place before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.377" offset="1267210">At no time prior to this identification show-up was either Kirby or being advised of his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.753" offset="1296677">In fact, the public defender was not appointed until approximately 7 weeks after their arrest and 8 days after indictment was returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.558" offset="1331890">Prior to trial, Kirby’s counsel filed a pretrial motion to suppress the identification testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.843" offset="1357072">This motion was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.752" offset="1368670">At trial, Shard testified that the men in the Courtroom on that date were the men whom he identified at the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.749" offset="1408690">Bean waived his privilege against self-incrimination and took the stand and testified that he and Kirby found the traveler’s check, screwing in an alley way, several hours prior to the time of their arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.161" offset="1466368">We respectfully submit the fifth case that is directly controlled by this Court’s decisions in United States versus Wade and Gilbert versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.565" offset="1507955">The State, at least in its brief, appeared to recognize no meaningful distinction between these decisions and case at bar, and therefore, urged that Wade and Gilbert be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.701" offset="1568455">It is certainly our position that Wade and Gilbert were rightly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.544" offset="1587890">Petitioner should have been advised of its right to counsel in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.128" offset="1602205">He had been at the police station, several hours, the alleged crime had occurred two days previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.917" offset="1633343">The state points no evidence or to no prejudice that it would suffered had counsel been appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.193" offset="1662495">Indeed, Illinois statute provides that an accused is entitled to counsel -- to consult with counsel immediately after being arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.375" offset="1699171">Beginning with Powell versus Alabama, this court has consistently held that counsel is required at all criminal stages and the criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.963" offset="1737519">In Wade, this Court reviewed the espy of the Sixth Amendment and found that counsel is necessary to assure the accused a meaningful defense, so that the accused shall not be required to stand alone at any critical stage in the criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.403" offset="1795302">Recognizing the vagaries of identification testimony, the Court realized that for all practical purposes that accused guilt maybe determined prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.742" offset="1848696">The Court therefore, held an identification confrontation is a critical stage and that the accused is as much entitled to counsel at that stage, as he is at the trial itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.515" offset="1895717">Now, the Supreme Court of Illinois has held that counsel is only required at post indictment lineups.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.391" offset="1931243">We submit that this rule exults form over substance and makes an accused rights depend upon the timing of the identification confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.879" offset="1977219">Furthermore, we think the Illinois rule allows the police to circumvent Wade by holding all identification confrontations prior to indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.466" offset="2019537">I think this Court would probably be in good company if it decided to overrule the Illinois rule, in fact all of the Federal Courts -- Lower Federal Courts and the majority except five -- the State Court that held that the pre-indictment, post-indictment distinction is meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.839" offset="2097068">This Court recognized that identification confrontation maybe surrounded with suggested influences and we submit that these suggestive influences may occur either prior or after indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.971" offset="2153597">The return of an indictment has really no relationship to the problems with which this Court was involved with in Wade.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="535.078" offset="2213992">That is right Your Honor, the state makes no arguments, so far as I can see that Wade is impossible to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.875" offset="2229144">It makes -- this argument basically is the fact that counsel performs no meaningful function at the identification confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.685" offset="2296435">This Court held in Wade that counsel’s presents will avert prejudice and will assure a meaningful confrontation at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.202" offset="2330499">I think just taking the facts of this case, one can readily see that counsel would have had a function.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.742" offset="2360696">First of all, counsel probably would have objected to the fact that these men were seated between two police officers, but when the victim came into the room that he was directly asked to point out the accused.</text>

            <text syncTime="1328.383" offset="5387243">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.642" offset="5404275">Before discussing the merits on the legal principles involved, I would like to clarify two or three -- the factual situations involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.798" offset="5448892">The arrest occurred as counsel of the petitioner indicated, because two police officers thought that the petitioner here look like a man wanted for con gang (ph) a man named Hampton (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.079" offset="5501973">Two police officers stopped the two people, petitioner and his partner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.178" offset="5534365">They asked petitioner if he was Hampton he said no, he was not Hampton.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.196" offset="5554427">The police asked if he had any identification, when the petitioner pulled out his wallet the officer noted traveler’s checks in the petitioner’s wallet he said who do the checks belonged to? At which time the petitioner said “Oh that is play money” after that the officers said, “Let me see them” and the petitioner handed the wallet to the officer who looked at the traveler’s checks, which had the name Willie Shard on them and said, “Who is Willie Shard?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.275" offset="5682740">To which the petitioner responded, “I won them in a crap game.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.487" offset="5703638">The appellate Court of Illinois upheld that initial arrest on the grounds of the contradictory explanations for the possession of the property, plus the absence of any identification that this man was in fact Willie Shard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.553" offset="5767899">Now during the course of our brief, we discussed several rules of application for United States versus Wade and when I refer to United States versus Wade, I of course include Gilbert versus California, but for convenience sake referred in the brief and will refer in the argument to Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.843" offset="5857029">We point out that there is one exception at least the Second Circuit has recognized for investigatory show-ups or investigatory confrontations, when that argument was advanced the petitioners replied that -- well this means that my client or the petitioner was arrested on grounds of suspicion that in investigatory -- the stop of this nature was not based on probable cause and if that position had been taken below, then this case will not be hear today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.818" offset="5992970">I have to differ with petitioner’s counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.568" offset="6011988">It seems to me that Hoffa versus United States in 385 US definitely rejected the proposition that investigatory -- investigative steps cannot be set to occur after probable cause existed, I think in this case that there was probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.817" offset="6088892">And that, as far as this show-up was concerned that it still constituted in investigatory show-up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.840" offset="6125046">I would also point out, with respect to this case, we raise two points: the first is that we do defend, despite the petitioner’s assertion to the contrary, the limitation of Wade to post-indictment cases, that is point one of our Brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.409" offset="6215325">We also attack this is our right since we are defending a judgment; we also raise the broader ground of the overruling in Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.096" offset="6250015">I would address myself first to the question of overruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.058" offset="6277914">I would also point out that when we ask for the overruling of Wade, we are not asking for the overruling of Stovall v. Denno, which recognized explicitly a Due Process right under the Due Process clause to attack unnecessarily suggest that a pre-trial confrontations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.808" offset="6348863">If United States versus Wade is overruled by this Court, it does not put out of the reach of the Federal Courts and of this Court, questions of suggested confrontations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.250" offset="6406646">Those of course, can still be reviewed under the Due Process clause, insofar as that right was recognized under Stovall versus Denno.</text>

            <text syncTime="1735.197" offset="7014463">But even if you assume that presence of counsel reduces a danger of unreliable evidence at every stage, in which evidence is gathered and all of the well recognized exceptions to -- Lower Court exceptions to the application of Wade would come under this reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="2205.254" offset="8894652">Now, I point also that in Wade, the Court was concerned with the potential for deliberate police suggestion, deliberate police misconduct, but yet the Court in Wade said that we are not going the hold at the taking of a blood test or the taking of a hand writing exemplars is a critical stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.085" offset="9013979">I would point out that this almost, although not quite the same, potential for abuse in those cases are requiring the presence of counsels as there is in the eye witness identification case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.108" offset="9062149">At least, theoretically possible that the police -- if they were malicious might use improper methods of taking blood or they might just say that the blood taken from the -- that they justified was taken the defendant, it was never taken from the defendant and counsel of course had he witnessed, the taking of blood that would be in a position to ensure the reliability, the fact finding procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.862" offset="9177088">The final point made I think with respect to the rationale within Wade is that the petitioner in a lineup -- when he challenges the lineup, has a terrible problem reconstructing what occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.389" offset="9255246">Now, I do not know that the problem exists, for example, there did not seem to be a great deal of difficulty in reconstructing what occurred in Wade or what occurred in Gilbert or what occurred in Stovall, there does not seem to have been -- all others minor disagreement does not seem to have been much difficulty reconstructing what occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.421" offset="9343331">And furthermore, that problem of reconstruction exists in every one of the accepted cases under Wade.</text>

            <text syncTime="3194.702" offset="12852517">I just want to make several points in my closing and that is, that this case is a very narrow case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.027" offset="12885744">The identification occurred several hours after the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.589" offset="12904030">The accused was in custody, the crime had occurred two days previously, there is no contention in this case, but that the police had plenty of time to advise petitioner of his rights and to secure counsel for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.812" offset="12960872">Now, the sole factor in Illinois, which makes the right to counsel attached is the presence of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.016" offset="12997757">I do not think that this is a proper rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.365" offset="13007161">Now, counsel for the state has cited several rules in other jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.205" offset="13026492">The immediate on-the-scene confrontation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3241.992" offset="13041643">The leading decision in that area, I think is Russel v. United States in the D.C. Circuit, where the Court distinguishes that situation from a later confrontation on the grounds that in that case the witness’s memory is fresh and that makes the identification at that stage very critical and very necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.921" offset="13149372">In this case, I think in reading the record you have to say that the focus of guilt has attached to the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.329" offset="13195034">He was under arrest, the police had searched police records, learned of the robbery, they called Shard to come down to the police station, I think it had passed from the investigatory stage in to a specific focus of guilt upon these two men that they commit this robbery and I think that is the reason why Shard was called down to the police station.</text>
