            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73749">We’ll hear arguments now in Mcclanahan v. Morauer &amp; Harzell, 5097.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.734" offset="172596">Mr. Smith, you proceed.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_louis_smith_jr" startTime="27.503" stopTime="353.150">
            <label>Mr. John Louis Smith, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="27.503" offset="183672">Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.636" offset="204257">The chief issue in this case involves Sec. 933 (g) of the Workman’s Compensation Act of the District of Colombia which is a Longshoremen’s and Harbor Worker’s Compensation Act involves the use of the term “compromise” involving settlements in which the insurance carry it for the Workman’s Compensation Company hasn’t participated.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.293" offset="314911">For a brief history in the case, Mr. Mcclanahan, the petitioner was injured on the job on October of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.897" offset="345318">He seasonably filed an action in the Workman’s Compensation of the -- Bureau of Employee’s Compensation in the District of Colombia, and also a third party action was filed against a third party tortfeasor in the U.S. District Court in the District of Colombia.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.764" offset="412714">The compensation claim was settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.639" offset="432253">Award was made of $3780.00 in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.734" offset="460675">The third party action came up at trial on February of 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.104" offset="482095">At that time a settlement was made in the chambers of a Judge Luther Youngdahl, which an award of $5000.00 was made, $3000.00 of which went to Mr. Mcclanahan’s wife as a consortium, and the balance of $2000.00 went to the claimant Mr. Mcclanahan.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.310" offset="566941">A motion to modify the Workman’s Compensation award was then filed, which was now 1967, three years after the original claim has been filed before the Deputy Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.451" offset="615529">A hearing was held in December of 1967 and April of 1968, in which the Deputy Commissioner asked what issues were before, I mean he was advised that it was just the issue of the compromise of whether or not this was a judicial evaluation made by this consent judgment in the third party case.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.369" offset="711137">The Deputy Commissioner having heard all these evidence made a finding that it was a judicial evaluation and made a temporary partial disability award of 25% which he stated entered in November of 1965 that the complainant’s condition reverted back to a state as that of that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.918" offset="797341">Motions for summary judgment were filed in the U.S. District Court in which both sides argued that the findings did not -- were not sustained by sufficient evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.179" offset="858363">Judge Hart (ph) ruled in favor of the respondent in this case, and stated that it was not a judicial evaluation, that it was a compromise, and that therefore, the claimant could not reach assurance to the Compensation Board for further money.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.456" offset="943522">This was appealed to the United States District Court, and they affirmed finding three distinctions between this case and Banks versus Chicago Grain Trimmers Association, 1968 decision of the United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.648" offset="1012276">They felt that it was distinguishable, and first of all on the grounds that it was not the result -- the compromise was not the result of a full hearing of all the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.210" offset="1054490">Secondly, that the Chicago Grain Trimmers did involve a remittitur, and because of this the party did not have to accept it, that this was a judicial evaluation by a judge presumably just finding that his evaluation, the claim, varied from that of the jury, and he had this right to offer the party, the remittitur if they wish to settle.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.709" offset="1152502">And third, that they were free to reject this and this freedom of reject resulted in prejudice to the employer and his carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.798" offset="1200880">Now as I urge Your Honor that these decision in the Court below is not in accord with Banks v. Chicago Grain Trimmers, or the Bell versus O’hern case and this is the grounds on which the petitioner’s certiorari was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.127" offset="1270157">I urge that this ruling is more in terms of the earlier decisions of the -- on the Section 33 (g) of the Longshoreman and Harbor Worker’s Act, and that the interpretations placed on it since then by the Banks case, and Bell, have shown a desire to encourage settlements Your Honor, and that this decision will completely discourage him because as a practical matter, it’s not very easy to get an insurance carrier to agree to a settlement of an award for an amount less than they’ve already paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.314" offset="1426996">The two claims are not of an equal footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.423" offset="1439431">One being of a nature of a non-fault insurance, this is really our first kind of non-fault insurance, and many times as the better case, especially if they have very poor liability to prove fault.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.150" offset="1486347">Well, isn’t the -- doesn’t this case turn on whether the enterprise that took place in the judge’s chambers that this is judicial determination or a compromised settlement, isn’t that the heart of the case?</text>

            <text syncTime="371.552" offset="1559907">It is the part of you thesis that if a judge suggests a figure of settlement, assuming that he did so here, that takes it out of the compromise area and makes it into a judicial evaluation, or judicial determination?</text>

            <text syncTime="394.241" offset="1650709">What I’m saying is that the Banks case does state in this language that it differs from these earlier cases in the fact that it was evaluated by a trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.786" offset="1708805">Now what I’m stating is that in this particular instance, the trial judge had before him certain information, perhaps not the information that you’d have from a fully conducted trail, but he did have the pretrial statement, which was available on all those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.548" offset="1775888">He had a deposition that had been given by the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.194" offset="1790516">He had something to go on in which to evaluate.</text>

            <text syncTime="462.782" offset="1924786">I think that they should have an obligation to show that there was some prejudice to them from this settle.</text>

            <text syncTime="1252.531" offset="5083826">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.343" offset="5103052">The question I think is adequately phrased, with respect to what transpired in Judge Youngdahl’s chambers, the only evidence on that point, that is in the record is contained in the testimony of Mr. Mahoney who was the lawyer representing the defendant in the third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.836" offset="5173060">This testimony starts on page 31 of the transcript of proceedings and as he said on page 32 with respect to the conference before Judge Youngdahl, as I recall it was done in his usual manner, but he discussed this settlement with both of us first, and then I believe I left the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.249" offset="5258742">The settlement was discussed with you, meaning counsel, and then I was called back in and you left the room and our figures were discussed then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.824" offset="5300956">As a result of the conference, an agreement was reached at $5,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.423" offset="5323421">This is the testimony of Mr. Mahoney, the witness, offered by counsel for the petitioner during the Workman’s Compensation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.270" offset="5362813">He was -- Mr. Mahoney was further examined with respect to the question as to why it was that a consent judgment was entered in this case as distinguished in the usual procedure of just filing a praecipe entering the case is settled and dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.370" offset="5423209">I was questioning him about that, and I said, “You’ve had several cases come up for trial before Judge Youngdahl, have you not?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.840" offset="5453093">He said “Yes sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.397" offset="5459258">There were of course occasions when a consent judgment was entered into as a result of a conference in chambers, he answered, that’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.372" offset="5491231">Question: Primarily, where the plaintiff is an infant?</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.226" offset="5506591">He nods and said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.304" offset="5518921">Question: Otherwise, generally speaking, a praecipe is merely filed entering the case as settled and dismissed with prejudice?</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.050" offset="5541909">That’s true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.456" offset="5547551">Question: Was there any discussion between the plaintiff’s lawyer and the judge that this consent judgment was necessary in order to eliminate the Workman’s Compensation carrier’s interest in the case, or to provide a means of avoiding the settlement provisions under Workman’s Compensation Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.832" offset="5617037">As to -- according to Mr. Mahoney, the answer was no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.026" offset="5633756">Question: Then why was it that with an adult plaintiff, a consent judgment was entered into in this case when there had been no real trial on the merits?</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.253" offset="5674716">Answer: For the protection of all concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.876" offset="5685165">It was felt that this consent judgment should be entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.598" offset="5700107">Question: For the protection, meaning the protection against the ramifications of the Workman’s Compensation Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.502" offset="5727692">Answer: No.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.784" offset="5732812">All concerned which would be the plaintiff and the attorneys involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.304" offset="5746918">Mr. Mcclanahan had had several lawyers that they’re under psychiatric care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.913" offset="5765308">Question: You are implying then that perhaps Mr. Mcclanahan would not have abided by the settlement without a consent judgment?</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.549" offset="5795924">No sir, I don’t imply that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.184" offset="5802402">Question: But there was no trial in the merits?</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.211" offset="5810552">Answer: No trial in the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.570" offset="5815986">Question: No testimony was offered?</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.785" offset="5836884">That’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.283" offset="5836779">And the jury was impelled?</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.896" offset="5841272">No verdict was rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.452" offset="5847542">So the question here is whether a discussion of this nature in the conference of the judge prior to the start of a trial constitutes as the Court has indicated, a judicial evaluation of the case as distinguished from a settlement, a judgment that merely affirms and ratifies a settlement that had previously been entered into between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.041" offset="5933850">This is not a particularly noble question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.512" offset="5951718">In Bell against O’hearne they cite Marlin against Cardillo, and I’m quoting, “The Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia Circuit held that a settlement between a claimant and a third party, entered into without the consent and agreement of the employer or insurance carrier, followed by the entry of a judgment in the agreed amount, barred the claimant from recovering any deficiency benefits under the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.705" offset="6068538">The Marlin case is likewise distinguishable from the instant case, Bell against O’Hearne, where there the settlement, the plaintiff’s claim was reached before the Court had established the amount of the third party’s liability and reduced it to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.847" offset="6129037">In Bell against O’hearne the Court, Fourth Circuit said, page 780 of 284 F.2d, as we construe the statute, meaning the specific provision of the Longshoreman’s Act that we’re dealing with here, “A recovery of deficiency compensation is barred only where the injured employee or his beneficiaries incase of death, have compromised the third party claim, or where judgment in the third party action has been entered as a result of a settlement or a compromise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.848" offset="6269053">The uncontradicted evidence in this case before the commission, and upon which both the trial court and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia acted, was that this was a settlement, it was entered into, and that the judgment in this case was entered into merely and solely for the purpose of confirming the settlement that the parties had previously reached.</text>

            <text syncTime="1580.918" offset="6397367">I’m looking at page 32 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.068" offset="6413981">The witness says, “I don’t know whether I was asked but I evaluated the case at, but I know at sometime during the discussion Judge Youngdahl felt that the case was worth $5,000.00, and that was the amount of the consent judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.041" offset="6501857">Yes sir, in other words, in this case it’s not as clearly one way or the other as some cases are, but it would seem to me that when a judge is evaluating a case for settlement purposes, he is considering a lot of things that he is not considering as a trial of defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.427" offset="6571447">He is considering odds of recovery, jury verdict ranges, and matters of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.079" offset="6594017">It is purely and simply a compromise, it’s the only real way that we can dispose of the case without having additional proceedings follow motions, appeals, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.749" offset="6640724">Now the Banks and Chicago Grain Trimmers Association case, which is the most recent opinion of this Court dealing with this subject, involved, as Justice Marshall indicated, the case were -- that it go into trial, evidence been offered and introduced, involved the question as to whether an order of remittitur constituted a judicial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.077" offset="6729958">It hardly seems worth mentioning that in order of remittitur would be a judicial determination made by a trier, based upon facts, testimony, and evidence that was before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.958" offset="6785547">We submit to Your Honors that the case that we have here is distinguishable, and we rely primarily upon the reasoning employed by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia.</text>

            <text syncTime="1694.655" offset="6852316">There is one thing that I wanted to mention when I was standing before and I -- forgot was, yesterday when I was researching these New York cases cited by Mr. Gregg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.076" offset="6902053">I checked the New York statute, and I’ve noticed that they’ve changed their statute and I felt the Court should be aware of this because really it’s a -- its in a McKinney’s Consolidated Laws of New York, 64 Workman’s Compensation Law, Section 1549, the pocket supplement, and they had the same similar language in their compromise statement and then they added on to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.476" offset="7011558">However, written approval of the carrier need not be obtained if the employee or his dependants obtain a compromise order from a justice of the Court in which the third party action was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.872" offset="7065161">The papers upon an application to compromise and settle such a claim shall consist of the petition, the affidavit of the attorney and the affidavit of a physician, or more, more than one position if necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.427" offset="7111450">And it spelled out basically what was a -- what should be in this information, and really did not provide an awful lot more information than was available in this case to Judge Youngdahl.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.335" offset="7163068">Then copies of these as -- when the judge arrives at a determination, copies of these are served on the carrier and if the carrier feels as if that’s not enough, then they can come in and challenge it, but they have to produce evidence that is not a fair settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.838" offset="7229001">And I believe that this was done in New York by the legislature there to encourage settlements and discourages ideal of a party who’s really not a party toward frustrating settlements.</text>
