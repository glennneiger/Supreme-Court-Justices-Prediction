            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="15.084" offset="134485">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.373" offset="147650">This case is hereon certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia and it raises in another context the questions of the preceding case and that is whether the imposition in carrying out of the death penalty in the case that one convicted of the crime of rape constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eight and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.354" offset="243572">A petitioner, Lucious Jackson was sentenced to death for the crime of rape by the Superior Court of Chatham county Georgia in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.587" offset="284532">His conviction was upheld by the State Supreme Court against Eight and Fourteenth Amendment policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.419" offset="307833">Petitioner was 21 year old, black escaped convict who has been sentenced for three years apparent to automobile’s theft.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.892" offset="345658">He is out of captivity for a period of three days and while out of captivity he allegedly committed several crimes as well as the rape for which he was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.396" offset="387768">The State evidence was that he broke into the home of a white housewife, the wife of a physician, threatened her with a pair of scissors, doles $5.00 and some change, engaged in a physical struggle with her, raped her, escaped when the maid arrived and hid in the neighbors garage for several hours till he was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.899" offset="469688">The prosecutrix in addition to having been raped, suffered from abrasions and lacerations but no additional injuries appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.532" offset="504274">The petitioner was indigent and represented by court-appointed counsel, apart from pretrial motions asking for appointment of a psychiatrist, a change of venue and a continuance to allow time to prepare the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.645" offset="556728">The Defense presented no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.221" offset="571043">The trial including a separate proceeding held in the morning the determined the petitioner is competent to stand trial, last but one day.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.717" offset="601032">Procuring only the base evidence and the petitioner is a Negro and on this record they sentenced him to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.693" offset="624960">The jury acted under Georgia Law, Section 26-1302 which appears in page 1A of our brief which is that -- was at that time, it has been changed slightly.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.807" offset="693401">The crime of rape shall be punished by death unless the jury recommends mercy in which event punishment shall be imprisonment for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.889" offset="721717">Provided however the jury in all cases may fix the punishment by imprisonment and labor in the penitentiary for not less than one year or more than twenty years.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.427" offset="755885">In the two cases just argued Akins and Furman, the petitioners urged that the death penalty in cases of homicide constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.518" offset="800189">Hereto in this case, we urge that the death penalty in the case of rape constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.679" offset="824849">And for a moment, I would like to focus on the word unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.035" offset="842298">Infliction of capital punishment for rape is indeed the most unusual of punishments for any crime in the United States or indeed in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.705" offset="880960">At this point, I am going to speak for a moment too about racial statistics, there have been some questions about racial statistics and statistics that may or may not be judicially noticeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.215" offset="918994">All the statistics that I will relate come from National Prisoner Statistics, their publication of the United States Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.835" offset="953476">The figures are so overwhelming that at a minimum if they are not conclusive, they have kept the burden upon the respondents who explained them.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.006" offset="990152">This is not strange in a racial case, in cases involving juries, schools, employment, voting, figures speak at the Fifth Circuits, have another context and Judges listen and sometimes the figures are not persuasive, sometimes they are conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.436" offset="1055876">At a minimum if they are sufficiently persuasive they have kept the burden of explanation upon the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.935" offset="1089835">Our opponent just said in their brief and have said in argument with regard to other aspects of statistics in these cases that there many questions of the statistics leave unanswered, for example in a rape case, has a death penalty been inflicted because the defendant is a particularly viscous person.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.338" offset="1167471">Was the crime committed by a group of people?</text>
            <text syncTime="276.019" offset="1178233">Was a weapon used?</text>
            <text syncTime="278.256" offset="1187115">Was an injury inflicted?</text>
            <text syncTime="279.615" offset="1192653">Does the victim have a particular reputation for chastity?</text>
            <text syncTime="282.595" offset="1204565">Was there a child involved and so forth?</text>
            <text syncTime="286.508" offset="1220134">We have attempted to answer these questions in another litigation in the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.588" offset="1248450">Williams against Georgia in which petitions for writ of certiorari is now pending before this Court, The law of the State of Georgia as declared by the Supreme Court of Georgia in the Williams case is, that the explanations are inadmissible, Williams against Georgia might say is purported to 173 Southeast Second, 72.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.997" offset="1338103">The explanations of the statistics which we have attempted to put into evidence by testimony and analysis of a representative sample of the rape cases in State of Georgia over a 20 year period, is that it is inadmissible and we would say that the figures that I am about to discuss are probably undoubtedly conclusive on their face but if there are any explanations to be made they should come from the State of Georgia, not from the respondents who have made an effort as to these figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.941" offset="1469864">The crime of rape is punished capitally in the Southern state only, is or was an exception in the State of Nevada which was punished by death where bodily harm was done, that statute has been invalidated and so it is Southern phenomenon only.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="369.469" offset="1551993">How was that statute invalidated?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="372.508" offset="1564218">By the court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="373.203" stopTime="374.964">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="373.203" offset="1566935">On what basis?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="374.964" stopTime="834.423">
            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="374.964" offset="1574041">I believe it was invalidated on the campaign against the U.S. Executive Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.184" offset="1606850">It is visited upon black people in the south overwhelmingly, there have been 455 executions for rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.543" offset="1644362">Since statistics have been kept and of the 445 men put to death, 405 had been black.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.828" offset="1681456">At the moment, there are 73 men on death row awaiting execution for the crime of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.408" offset="1711758">Of the 73, 62 are black, one is the Mexican, one is an Indian and the race of three is not known to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.430" offset="1751882">That means that historically since figures were kept and at the present time the execution rate for the crime of rape run approximately at the rate of 90% black defendants put to death were being held on death row to be put to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.875" offset="1817606">In the State of Georgia, 61 men had been put to death for the crime of rape since statistics were kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.976" offset="1849998">Of those 61, 58 have been black and the Georgia statistics run somewhat higher at about a rate of 95%.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.806" offset="1893361">Now, in the case of Williams against the State of Georgia and in two other cases pending in the State of Georgia, there have been efforts to examine these statistics in considerably more detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.809" offset="1945397">All this matters are pending in Court in the State of Georgia and Williams case is pending here as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.993" offset="1970161">In the case of Mitchell against Smith published pending in the Court of Caswell County.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.973" offset="2010076">The statistics were developed at a very considerable length and it was demonstrated that in cases where a black man raped a white woman, 38% of the defendants were sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.899" offset="2065770">In a case where any other racial combination was involved, one half of 1% of the defendants were sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.634" offset="2096698">Now, these are the States where it is well-known, I need not elaborate on this where there has been for many years until outlawed by this Court, in other Courts racial segregation in schools and various aspects of public life are required or permitted, these were also the States and I think it is much more appropriate to the point which had Anti-miscegenation laws until they were outlawed by the Loving case, and there is a long footnote in Loving case which detailed which of the States had those laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.581" offset="2212473">Also with considerable overlap of State which have capital punishment for rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.027" offset="2242253">Now, in the rest of the world and I think that an inadmissible consideration is taken to account.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.629" offset="2272659">Capital punishment for rape is authorized only in South Africa, Malawi and Taiwan.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.801" offset="2305365">That is throughout the entire world, certainly across the entire western world which shares our culture, that the entire English speaking world which hears our jurisprudence, throughout the entire United States, throughout the southern part of the United States with the exception of black men, there is slight exception for some small ants and the white ants who suffered death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.371" offset="2411631">Capital punishment for rape is a penalty so rare that I think the word “unusual” is perhaps an understatement of the frequency which it appears difficult to think of a punishment which is more unusual than capital punishment for rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.773" offset="2489267">It is unusual in -- look at in other points of view, in Ralph against Warden, the case that tried by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit which invalidated capital punishment for rape in certain circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.175" offset="2554886">Judge Butzner sets forth the fact that between 1960 and 1968 there were 190,790 reported cases of rape, by 1971 and 1972, of course the figures are higher.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.823" offset="2613401">Yet at that time, there were only 70 men on death row for the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.050" offset="2638374">And the disproportion is to say stagnant as though the punishment is cruel and unusual in any sense of those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.477" offset="2672019">Now, the State of Georgia particularly, the outcome which I have described here, I may not be strange, in fact maybe in entirely it is speculated.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.482" offset="2708068">There is a legislative history to the Georgia statute which casts considerable life on its reasons for its enactment and the way it is operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.554" offset="2756343">Before the Civil War in the State of Georgia there were two sets of statutory penalties for the crime of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.796" offset="2785286">If a slave or a free person of color raped a white woman, he was to get the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.335" offset="2815484">Any other rape was punishable by a term of one to 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.452" offset="2831993">After the Civil War, the statutory scheme which was on the books in the State of Georgia was repealed and the offense would essentially statutory scheme that we have at this point was reenacted to take its place and we have all these statutes set forth verbatim in the appendix at the end of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.442" offset="2907957">And the discretionary death penalty for the crime of rape was enacted into Georgia law and what has happened in the administration of the Statute, this discretionary statute has been essentially what was required under the particular language of the Georgia legislation that existed prior to the Civil War.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.346" offset="3027494">Looking at capital punishment in general, as for as the crime of rape and the crime of homicide, we find that while it is authorized for a one purpose or another in most of the States, it is in fact almost never applied except in random, unstandardized way against the poorest, the least educated and disproportionately against racial minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.978" offset="3146090">The figures can be put together in various ways, it might be said that, it has been said by some counsel this morning that most of the States authorized capital punishment for one crime or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.662" offset="3196767">Another way of looking at it is that if one takes the past decade, 1962 and takes the State where there have been no executions and going to the past decade, one does not -- one is not confined to the period of time, I mean, judicial stage have been dominating the scripture.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.062" offset="3270432">If one takes the past decade, one finds that in 24 States in which there has not been an execution or executions might be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.458" offset="3303974">One finds nine States in which capital punishment has been completely abolished making 33 States or 60% of the -- 66% of the State of the States of Union which means they have exercised or permit capital punishment for any crime and overwhelming number of jurisdictions in the free world including invalid in England, the judicial chair upon the jurisprudence.</text>

            <text syncTime="898.154" offset="3666762">It hadn't spoken of the question of unusualness -- just awarded to about the issue of cruelty, we will submit that if the word means anything at all in plain English and analysis of a constitution of legislative provision while it does not end with the men with -- but must start with the reading of the plain language.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.258" offset="3767177">The intentional taking of a life of a prisoner who is held in captivity and has been held there for years, years by any plain understanding of that word “cruel” and I think that the framers of the Bill of Rights recognized that, they may not have thought it was unusual but Mr. Livermore in the debate on the Bill of Rights, in our brief, it is set forth on 7 (d), some of this very little legislative history, spoke about the Cruel and Unusual Clause then it is said that no cruel and unusual punishment is to be inflicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.891" offset="3913672">It is sometimes necessary to hang a man, villains often deserve whipping and perhaps having their ears cut off but are we in the future to be preventive from inflicting the punishments because they are cruel, I mean if they were recognized to be cruel, whipping and cutting off the ears, would not recognize to be unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.607" offset="3992561">Now, it is unusual for any cause and even more unusual for the crime of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.019" offset="4022236">As to -- sometimes, the meaning of the term is confined to mode of punishments that is gassing or electrocution or hanging cruel?</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.443" offset="4079915">After that, there are materials set forth in our brief but if the case is reduced to the issue of whether or not the particular mode of execution is cruel, the minimum ought to be made an evidentiary hearing which had been at point some of these cases have discussed that somewhat at length in the last footnote, in 328.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.589" offset="4172493">In some cases and indeed historically we have looked at the question of proportionality or disproportionality, is it excessive to take a man’s life for any crime or for the crime of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.526" offset="4216274">And that raises the questions submitted the common view of the death penalty of rape that throughout this country or through out the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.178" offset="4238844">That is the fitness or the unfitness of the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.756" offset="4249188">And in this sense through the and unusualness we believe merge and we get back to the question particularly in the rape cases of -- is it disproportionate to take a life for this crime when -- so few countries in the world, no other countries in the world and so few States with this punishment for this crime and then confine it essential to the black people and the note here saying that on death rows there are now thirty men on death row in 34 States.</text>

            <label>Ms. Dorothy T. Beasley</label>
            <text syncTime="1238.258" offset="5027219">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.213" offset="5046968">This Court has said in Stein versus New York in 1947 that it would not apply the Fourteenth Amendment to standardize the administration of justice has stagnate local variations and practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.526" offset="5096287">And in 1959 in Williams versus Oklahoma, it was said neither the Due Process Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment nor anything else in the Federal Constitution requires the State to physically impose any particular penalty for any crime it may define or to impose the same or “proportionate sentences” for separate and independent crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.154" offset="5186775">That was in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.611" offset="5200568">If the death penalty for the crime of rape is cruel and unusual then I would submit that it is an imposition upon the legislative enactment which has been enacted and has been the law in Georgia since -- before in 1851.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.280" offset="5275278">Rape has consistently taken the death penalty in Georgia and just in 1960, the legislature again considered the penalty for rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.791" offset="5317283">I think it is significant to note that when it did consider the penalty in 1960, it was not whether it should or should not do away with the death penalty for a rape but rather should it leave it to the discretion of the jury to make it in or current sentencing of one year to life or should it be rather one to twenty years or a life and the latter was what went out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.112" offset="5418638">But there was no question either in 1960 as to whether the maximum penalty should be the death penalty or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.210" offset="5446955">That is the will of the people of Georgia and there has been nothing shown in this case which would indicate that that will should be overborne by a construction of the United States constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.614" offset="5504633">The main argument that is made is that the legislative history of the rape statute in Georgia shows that it must be based on racial considerations and I would submit that what Mr. Justice Blackmun said in Stevens when he was the Circuit Judge quoting “Brown versus Allen,” a 1953 case is applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.122" offset="5598674">The quotation was former errors cannot invalidate through retrial and I think that is very legitimate here because most of the statistics that are taken by the petitioners brief allegedly show that the only factor which goes to indicate the death penalty for rape in Georgia cases must be rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.974" offset="5689998">I think that those factors or those statistics are used from a period of time in 1930’s, in 1920’s and 1940’s, 1950’s when perhaps there was racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.847" offset="5741512">We do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.942" offset="5745900">But the cases are now looked at as to what their circumstances are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.247" offset="5763141">Or how heinous they are in comparison to other rape or the proportion of persons, white or black who commit rape and what in factual circumstances of the cases are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.647" offset="5820715">And I think that they cannot make the presumption which they indicate here that the jury are looking at rape cases in determining that a man should suffer the death penalty in the last analysis because only of his race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.623" offset="5892604">And that is the presumption which the petitioner asked this Court to make, I think there is valid basis for that whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.921" offset="5921861">Moreover, they do not apply it to the circumstances in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.205" offset="5938997">Their argument is based on generality that well, there are so many Negro men who have been executed for rape in Georgia and there are so many Negro men now on death row in Georgia for rape that it must be because they are black.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.194" offset="5998870">I think that they have put -- offered no support whatsoever to forward that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.758" offset="6025201">Moreover, I point out that among those who are now on death row or really not even on death row, they are kept on a different floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.055" offset="6058325">We do not have a death row for prisoners until they have a date set.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.531" offset="6084238">There are two white men that are now under death penalty for the crime of rape in Georgia and I would question the particulars whether the penalty should be imposed upon them because after all their rape could not possibly have been involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.038" offset="6150276">So, is it not cruel and unusual punishment to them too?</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.079" offset="6170442">It could not be if the consideration is only one of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.792" offset="6185280">Moreover, if it is a racial consideration, the contention is again a lack of equal protection perhaps, the discrimination that has the reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.947" offset="6229897">But that is not shown, it is not proved, they do not meet the quality of proof that requires to make a prima facie case of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.553" offset="6264378">Secondly, it would be instead an indictment against the jury system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.757" offset="6285172">It would be a presumption that the jurors are using a prejudice against rape to indicate what would be an appropriate penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.558" offset="6328326">That again does not fit to the death penalty per se but rather attacks the jury system and I think there is no basis whatsoever dealing in this case or in this brief by the petitioner to show that that would be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.197" offset="6426965">I would like to point out also that he makes no claim of discrimination in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.927" offset="6449848">There certainly would be many opportunities to show it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.590" offset="6464476">We have the voir dire in which any indications of prejudice could have been shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.248" offset="6483180">It was the motion for a new trial and that would have been an absolutely perfect place to show that a penalty was excessive under the circumstances of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.290" offset="6527275">The usual practice, to file a motion for a new trial to indicate that the penalty or the verdict was unjust or that it lacked equity so that the Court would have an opportunity to look at the penalty and see where in circumstances of the case which was before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.221" offset="6603030">It was a very lively before it not on an appellate record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.472" offset="6620062">The Court itself could measure whether the penalty was excessive in that particular case.</text>
