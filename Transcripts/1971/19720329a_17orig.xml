            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="73727">We'll hear arguments next in 17 original, Nebraska against Iowa.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard H. Moldenhauer</label>
            <text syncTime="44.298" offset="250837">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.004" offset="261704">This case involves Nebraska's contention that the State of Iowa has violated the Iowa-Nebraska Boundary Compact of 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.125" offset="294200">In order to properly evaluate the contentions of the State of Nebraska, we feel it's essential at first we have to examine into the situation as it existed in 1943 and in prior years.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.349" offset="335056">The case of Nebraska versus Iowa decided in 1892 determined the originally the boundaries between the two States was the center of the main channel of the Missouri River.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.507" offset="371732">And the boundary moved with changes of the channel, when these changes were gradual and imperceptible but when they were sudden or by avulsion, then the boundary remained in the bed of the abandoned channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.554" offset="423872">These principles applied at that time, both to State and private boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.347" offset="443098">There's no dispute down through the years and Missouri River was very notorious for all of its periodic flooding and many natural changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.573" offset="471938">And it was common knowledge that at many times that it changed its course and had had physically dissevered lands from one State and left them on the opposite side of the river and this created all kinds of problems in determining a jurisdiction, titles, which schools children should go to, and taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.527" offset="543827">And the legislative history of both States is replete with recognition of these problems and the legislatures had boundary commissions from 1901 through 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.823" offset="580920">Commencing at about 1934, on top of this already confused situation along the river, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers set out to create a new and stabilized channel for the Missouri River.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.811" offset="624911">This channel was supposed to be 700 feet wide and was prepared on the drawing boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.427" offset="643405">And then the Corps of Engineers said the construction dikes and revetments set about to place the river in that channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.729" offset="668587">And commencing in 1938, they also dug canals to physically place the river in the channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.312" offset="694919">These canals consisted in many cases initially of a ditch, dug on dry land and then, they opened or pulled the plug at the top and allowed the water to go through when it scoured out through that dry land the new channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.737" offset="752597">At that time, the Corps, when it moved the river, moved it around islands, around barren areas, and through bank area.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.314" offset="778929">And it created or further confusion in so far as boundary problems were concerned, but the Corps, when it channelized the river, paid no attention to the boundary, it was not concerned with this, it was concerned in confining the river and stopping the flooding and improving navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.279" offset="842772">By 1943, the Corps had dredged canals of at least 11 locations and Nebraska feels that the evidence shows at least 15 places, but that really is not important, there were several canals, which they have dug.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.231" offset="894599">And in 1943, South of Omaha, the river was 99% in its design channel to the Nebraska border, and North of Omaha, it was approximately 78% in the design channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.303" offset="954889">But, this river worked by the Corps had further compounded many the title problems which existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.120" offset="978191">In 1943, then the states, under the assumption that the river was finally stabilized, entered into a Compact to settle their boundary, and at that time we think the facts are very significant, because at that time, each state and the Master so found, recognized that the shifts of the channel in the past had been so numerous and intricate that for practically all land adjacent to the river, there were no conclusive determination of either State or private boundaries was considered passable.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.526" offset="1083830">They both recognized that in many places the boundary line was not located in Missouri River.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.754" offset="1104728">And that these places had not been determined and were almost impossible of determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.884" offset="1125208">And if a compromised couldn't be worked out and if they have to make a determination, where the boundary had been fixed on dry land, it would be an extremely complicated and an expensive process.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.833" offset="1168989">At this time and prior to this time, the State of Iowa was making no claim to abandon river beds or islands arising in the bed of the Missouri River and under any common law claim of sovereign ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.607" offset="1216114">In 1932, they have purchased some land in an abandon river bed, in a well-known avulsion of the Lake Manawa, just south of Council Bluffs, Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.709" offset="1256551">And they were not claiming islands which existed south of Omaha, where the river had been entirely in the design channel, since at least about 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.165" offset="1290302">There were abandoned channels in oxbows all up and down the Missouri River, on both sides of Missouri River.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.497" offset="1311618">And Iowa had made no claim to these abandoned channels on oxbows on either side.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.379" offset="1331157">There was a case in 1938 and the Nebraska District Court, which was eventually, decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit called U.S. v. Flower, where the Court found an avulsion in Nebraska land on the Iowa side of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.349" offset="1383089">And Iowa was a party to that case at one time in the District Court, and then the Court allowed her to withdraw, she did, but she never came in and claim that abandoned channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.774" offset="1416734">The Iowa Code, during all of these period required that the Secretary of State was a State Land Office and would maintain in separate track books the areas of lands which the State may now own or may hereafter own, so that there would be a separate record of the lands in state ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.703" offset="1480473">Iowa had no record of any State-owned lands along the Missouri River or lands which she used to claim at a future date.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.480" offset="1503565">The Iowa Coast, since 1923 had provided that the Conversation Commission would mark its boundaries, in cases, where the jurisdiction or the boundaries of its jurisdiction is privately owned property.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.110" offset="1554138">And then in 1931 or 1932, they added with the Commission deemed at feasible, but they had not marked boundaries along the river where the Commission Property supposedly commenced and where the landowners' property limits were terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.179" offset="1614429">Again, the Master found and we think properly the States didn't know where the boundary was located and they didn't care.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.316" offset="1634909">And neither States thought it was necessary in order to settle their problems to identify or pinpoint, where the boundary was at any particular location.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.191" offset="1666465">There were lands taxed in Nebraska, which were on the Iowa side or the left bank side of the river, as you look down the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.832" offset="1693005">There were some lands on the right bank, or Nebraska side, which were recognizably in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.845" offset="1713067">Nebraskans were in possession and claiming many of these lands and lands on the Nebraska side.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.155" offset="1734279">Iowans were in possession in claiming and some of those possessions came from some claim of a record title, others might have been commenced just with open notorious adverse possession which was possible under Nebraska law.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.532" offset="1791853">The two States entered into the Compact in 1943 to settle all these chaos and confusion and as the Master found to accomplish the general purpose of settling and laying the risk, the boundary and jurisdictional problems which existed between the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.457" offset="1843471">And he found they intended to settle all of their problems arising from the indefinite nature of this boundary and from the work by the Corps in channelizing the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.244" offset="1878684">Now, following the Compact and before we go into the terms of Compact, we think this is also significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.090" offset="1898014">Parties in possession on the left bank or Iowa side, continued to exercise ownership without disturbance from the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.815" offset="1924973">In many instances the land was placed on the tax rules of the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.365" offset="1939183">Some plant land was placed in the government farm program.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.692" offset="1948483">It was clear, some of it was improved.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.624" offset="1960186">In 1946, owners of one of the areas about which a great deal of evidence was introduced, Nottleman Island or Bouvet (ph) Island brought a lawsuit against the county officials to have it placed on the tax rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.983" offset="2005639">Their attorney Mr. Whitney Gilliland who was presently with the Civil Aeronautics Board had notified the Attorney's General Office of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.637" offset="2028209">They have discussed it and the Court found that they claimed the land through Nebraska titles and an issue of ownership, ordered Mills County out with places on the tax rules and it was taxed thereafter --</text>

            <text syncTime="777.507" offset="3183657">In 1961, Iowa came out with a Missouri River planning report and I believe the Master forward copies to this Court, which was a first document where they publicly announced a policy of claiming lands on the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.327" offset="3230991">And there is an evidence how they selected these areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="795.054" offset="3253874">They didn't talk to the landowners.</text>

            <text syncTime="799.064" offset="3269965">If somebody raised the Nebraska title, they automatically called it a spurious and fictitious title.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.583" offset="3288042">And all of a sudden, all these farmers, who have these lands since 1963 or farming it found they were under attack by the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.614" offset="3312179">They couldn't borrow on their land, which in partly the operation tremendously difficult and they couldn't understand the situation they've been placed in.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.960" offset="3349482">Now, going back to the Compact, which was a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.549" offset="3363902">First, it was an agreement between the two States and Iowa bound herself in this Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.992" offset="3385636">The first section, established the boundary and it established it in the middle of this main channel, as it appear on the Corps of Engineer maps.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.755" offset="3416669">This made the boundary a fixed line.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.378" offset="3427223">It changed the boundary between the States from a movable boundary, in every case to a fix line on the geographic center.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.234" offset="3454599">Now, in most instances, that navigable channel, where the river was still the boundary had followed the outside of the bends and it cross back and forth as it flowed down the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.214" offset="3494514">So that what Compact did was change the location of that boundary, and it changed it to a fix line, so it changed the State's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.493" offset="3519696">One of the issues is did this change the private riparian owner's right. and we don't think that by changing our state line, we change the line of the private owners, because we think that their lines should have stayed the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.887" offset="3565254">We didn't take away their right, which was a vested property right.</text>

            <text syncTime="908.642" offset="3708196">So, land in its very strict technical sense was transferred back and forth, all along that river.</text>

            <text syncTime="1017.366" offset="4143187">So, we don't feel that Iowa can conduct herself, because she agreed that they're good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.785" offset="4160845">But then she come and attacked them and we say this is binding on her courts, on her legislative and executive branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.310" offset="4190938">So she can't say we are going to go and determine our courts, because our courts are also bound by what are commitment was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.512" offset="4211732">That is one basic proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.707" offset="4220509">Now, there was also -- you see Section 3, we feel was language of recognition of a situation in private titles, then the States added Section 4, which said that taxes for the current year can be levied on lands ceded to the other State and for one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.446" offset="4275471">And that any rights under those taxes, accrued or accruing would be asserted in five years or be forever barred in the States would stop taxing across the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.893" offset="4305250">So, 4, we feel was a limitation on what the States can do, 3 was a recognition of private rights and the States look that this and said now we solved their problem, we have no more problems, we're through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.097" offset="4358018">And we think that this Compact has to be construed liberally to effectuate the intention for which it was adopted and that was to settle all the problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.881" offset="4389156">We agree with the Master's finding that in any action by landowner or by Iowa along the river that the landowner should not have to prove where the boundary was beforehand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.982" offset="4425623">If he raises some Nebraska title, Iowa should have to recognize it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.310" offset="4438893">The evidence is clear that Iowa didn't even inquire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.686" offset="4448401">And, when the titles were raised, she has said they're spurious and fictitious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.166" offset="4462298">We go a little further and contend that Iowa shouldn't be able to raise all these problems that we ought to be placed in a situation we were in 1943 and for at least 15 years or after, before Iowa starting asserting these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.675" offset="4512349">And if that means that Iowa has to recognize the Nebraska owners title to the bed, and Iowa has easement for public navigation, as Nebraska has or it's all the public has, she hasn't been deprived with anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.892" offset="4557280">There were areas, where the river was entirely in Nebraska, at the time of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.191" offset="4574416">And in those areas, many of which the States did not want to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.557" offset="4587895">Our contention is that the entire bed was in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.171" offset="4598344">And when Iowa said titles good Nebraska, shall be good in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.499" offset="4611719">She is recognizing the title to the bed, she didn't accept it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.741" offset="4624676">Iowa position now is we own the entire bed because it's in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.483" offset="4643588">Another issue, which has come up was originally decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, I think it was in November of 1960, in which another situation, where there's no question about the facts occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.258" offset="4694684">The river was in the design channel, it moved out into Iowa, land build up behind it, and the Corps of Engineers placed it back in the design channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.584" offset="4724045">This case involved between $12,000.00 and $13,000.00 of damages condemnation by the Corps of engineers for placing the river back into the design channel or the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.870" offset="4757169">The Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit said the land is in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.296" offset="4770857">Iowa owns the bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.220" offset="4774514">Therefore, Iowa owns it and the Nebraska riparian owner was deprived of his ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.648" offset="4792277">Iowa has used that principle in order to make her claims to all lands, north of Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.389" offset="4815265">And our position is this, that when we intended to settle this thing, we didn't change the private property owner's boundary, it should have stayed the same, because we couldn't divest them of their property rights without due process of law and without compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.070" offset="4869913">Had it not been for the Compact, when that river moved into Iowa, the Nebraska riparian owners' rights, which extended to the thalweg or thread of the stream moved with it, because that's a private property boundary matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.277" offset="4918814">And it moved over and when the Court put it back without washing away the intervening islands, it was an avulsion, which left that private property boundary remaining over into Iowa and the Nebraska riparian owner should have had preserve to him his right to his accretions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.769" offset="4976702">If it is read otherwise, then we say that Nebraska riparian owner has been deprived of his property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.211" offset="5006481">It's very easy to say, the lands in Iowa, therefore Iowa applies, and therefore Iowa owns it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.478" offset="5023618">But the fact is what did the parties agreed to and we say Iowa law is what the Compact provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.507" offset="5043680">Requiring Iowa to recognize private rights and we say that you have to look and cede.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.854" offset="5069071">You'd have to say in the Tyson case, but for the Compact, the boundary would have been clear over into Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.309" offset="5090909">The States avoided the necessity of worrying about that as between themselves but they shouldn't be able to deprive the riparian owner of his rights, because of that, of their agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1770.305" offset="7154896">Basically, we feel that she failed to prove that, because the proof is, that what we have done is engage in litigation in a Court of competent jurisdiction concerning the ownership of several of these areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.072" offset="7233995">We didn't send out the National Guard or the Corp of Game Wardens, or the Highway Patrol to move these people off these islands or off these abandoned channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.368" offset="7271193">All we did was engage his litigation in this litigation, sometimes as plaintiff, sometimes as a defendant, sometimes as an intervenor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.090" offset="7322080">In the Iowa Courts, of course, because these areas, which the State claims to own are all in Iowa and we simply don't feel that, that was violation of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.574" offset="7383938">Secondly, we feel that they haven't proved that judicial controversy between these two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.300" offset="7422912">They fail to prove that because Nebraska has no real and present interest in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.595" offset="7460006">Some of our citizens do, some citizens of Iowa do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.219" offset="7482576">Some non-residents of both States do, but Nebraska has no interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.744" offset="7512669">She doesn't claim to own any of these areas, which Iowa now claims to own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.373" offset="7547151">That was established by interrogatories and answers into interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.706" offset="7568467">Early in the pretrial phases of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.597" offset="7592081">It is for these reasons for the reason that she failed in her proof that we feel that this Court should not exercise its powers of original jurisdiction in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1953.309" offset="7886951">This is the first case that ever came before the Court, where this sort of a situation exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.770" offset="7916731">And I don't believe, as far as I know at least, there isn't any prior case on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.204" offset="7962498">It's perfectly true that the State of Iowa does assert in this case, and in these cases in State Court, where we think the issues should be decided, that we do own the bed of the Missouri river, in so far as that bed is in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.685" offset="8056434">And we do assert that we own certain islands, not all islands, but certain islands, which have formed over that bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.832" offset="8105022">Specifically, the islands which have formed in Iowa over that bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.424" offset="8131353">If they've formed in Nebraska, we agreed that we do not own them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.504" offset="8159670">Also, we claim to own certain abandoned channels of the river in Iowa, but not all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.852" offset="8201048">And the reason for this is that it is the law of Iowa that the State doesn't remain the owner of all abandoned channels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.141" offset="8274191">I think a fair statement of the law of Iowa is that we only own abandoned channels, which are abandoned by an avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.887" offset="8317240">And wherever an abandon channel was abandoned by the process of accretion, by the process of land forming to the shore from a private riparian owner, then the private riparian owner owns that land, as accretion to his riparian shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.202" offset="8422462">The Iowa rules, I think our best summarized in the case of Holman versus Hodges in 1901, by the Iowa Supreme Court Justice Ladd, which is cited in our brief and the reasons for them are fully discussed in that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.299" offset="8502919">This has been the law of Iowa, consistently since 1856, ten years after we were admitted to statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.368" offset="8543147">The Court in Iowa has never deviated and there are a number of cases at least since 1943, where the Iowa Court has said that this is still the law of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.856" offset="8617126">Iowa owns the bed, Iowa owns accretions to the bed, Iowa owns abandoned channels, which were abandoned by avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.438" offset="8663415">Now Nebraska claims in this case that we signed a way our right to claim ownership of anything along the Missouri River, by operation of that common law, when we entered into the 1943 Boundary Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.307" offset="8774906">This is the equivalent of saying that the 1943 Boundary Compact repealed the law, repealed the common law of Iowa, in so far as it would apply to the Missouri River.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.032" offset="8841779">We deny that, that happened as a result of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.391" offset="8895278">And the first reason I would mention for our denial is that the Compact simply doesn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.387" offset="8931223">And it doesn't say anything like that and in a sense it said just the opposite of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.576" offset="8968003">When Nebraska proposes that the Compact repealed the Iowa common law along the river, she recognizes her responsibility to oppose something to fill the void, which would then be left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.437" offset="9031428">She proposes then that Nebraska Common Law should take over and apply on both sides of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.572" offset="9083987">Now that's diametrically opposed to what the Compact said, because Section 2 says that the State of Nebraska, hereby siege to the State of Iowa and relinquish its jurisdiction over all lands not only in Nebraska, but lying easterly of said boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.318" offset="9170922">And there was a reciprocal session in the Iowa enactment of the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.167" offset="9206344">By this language we think Nebraska said to Iowa, nevermore will our sovereignty or our jurisdiction, or our land title laws extend east of the boundary and into Iowa.</text>

            <text syncTime="2514.559" offset="10131915">Now, we think that -- let me say one more thing, first of all we have cited all the Nebraska cases in our exceptions to the Special Master's report, which could possibly be construed as creating a vested right in the landowner to the bed of the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.021" offset="10237763">And there is no case in Nebraska, which involves the bed of a navigable stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.459" offset="10263467">Every case in which any remark has been made about this is our law, private ownership to the thread has involved either accretions in being or it has involved the Platte River, which is a non-navigable stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.662" offset="10336297">So, we say that all the statements that Nebraska Court has ever made about it are in the nature of dicta.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.620" offset="10368166">And, we agree that dicta, perhaps creates the law of Nebraska, but it doesn't create vested rights, which the Nebraska unicameral couldn't change and it's our position in this case that when the Nebraska unicameral ceded to Iowa everything east of the new boundary then it was she it was the unicameral that was changing the law that would be equitable to those areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.155" offset="10550292">And, they were saying hereafter, the law of Iowa shall apply to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.041" offset="10573802">Nebraska said that the unicameral couldn't do that, because these landowners had vested rights in the bed of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.707" offset="10628555">We say no, they had no vested rights, and therefore, the Supreme Court of Nebraska could have changed their common law concerning ownership of their riverbeds they never have, but they could have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.079" offset="10689995">And legislature possessed the power to change the Nebraska law and in so far as it's applicable to lands east of the boundary, that's precisely what the unicameral did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.204" offset="10794485">The Special Master agreed with us on this proposition and at page 193 of his report, he sets out his proposed rule for determining ownership of lands, which have formed since the Compact, since 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.327" offset="10891033">And by the way to give you some idea of what's involved here; Iowa now claims to own approximately 30 areas, up and down the river, between Sioux City and the Missouri State line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.081" offset="10965952">Approximately, eight of these areas were in existence at the time the Compact was entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.001" offset="11005658">And the remaining 22 areas have come into existence, since the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.982" offset="11065636">Mr. Moldenhauer mentioned that one case has gone as far as the Eight Circuit concerning the ownership of one of these tracks of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.880" offset="11125195">A track of land which is now involved here and included in the 30 areas, which Iowa claims to own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.677" offset="11164378">And this case was entitled in Circuit Court, Tyson versus Iowa, decided in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.795" offset="11208891">Mr. Moldenhauer has very roughly, but correctly related the facts of Tyson after 1943, the river escaped from the designed channel, which was west of the area, the area being in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.898" offset="11305231">It escaped by washing away its left bank and stabilizing structures and ultimately the left bank moved approximately a mile and a half into Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.482" offset="11359565">In the meantime, the right bank or Nebraska bank remained stationary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.012" offset="11389763">When the river acquired a width of a mile and a half, of course it became shallow and an island arose on the Iowa side of the boundary but west of the thalweg of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.849" offset="11473041">In other words, on the Nebraska side of the thalweg, but on the Iowa side of the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.486" offset="11515569">Both the District Court, Judge Hickland (ph) and the Circuit Court held that the island belong to Iowa because it had arisen over and has an accretion to the State own bed of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.298" offset="11606893">Now, Nebraska recognizes in this case that if they are to have their construction of the Compact, and if they are going to have their way, the Tyson decision must be overruled or at least disavowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.493" offset="11695605">The Special Master considered that proposition very carefully and concluded that the Tyson case was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.548" offset="11731863">The law of the Tyson case is valid and that it should not be overruled and disavowed, it's about that simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.615" offset="11768120">And the law which comes out of the Tyson case, as far as we're concerned is about this, that Tyson's right to accrete by Nebraska law was limited to the state boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.965" offset="11853489">And he could not before the Compact and cannot since the Compact accrete by Nebraska law into Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.323" offset="11910958">Secondly, if Tyson were to accrete into Iowa, he could only do so, under Iowa law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.257" offset="11962680">Now, there is a possibility that a Nebraska landowner could accrete into Iowa under Iowa law, because Iowa recognizes that the private riparian owner becomes the owner of accretions which formed to his high bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.322" offset="12062991">The thing that Iowa law denies is that a private riparian owner of either state can accrete under the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.314" offset="12130909">Now, Nebraska lets the man accrete under the water, because his boundary, by Nebraska law is the thalweg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.012" offset="12177720">And wherever the thalweg goes, there goes his boundary, but not by Iowa law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.739" offset="12216591">It inheres in the Tyson decision that the Common Law of Iowa, which has been in effect since 1856 is still in effect in inheres in Tyson that it wasn't repealed by the Compact and it inheres in the decision that Iowa didn't sign a way her rights to claim ownership of lands, river beds, and so forth by its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.568" offset="12371967">Actually, the Tyson case simply follows a long line of cases by this Court of which Arkansas versus Tennessee is an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.912" offset="12433303">There've been several Arkansas-Tennessee cases and the one I refer to is 246 U.S. 158.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.712" offset="12468516">The Special Master quotes from that decision at page 188 of his report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.138" offset="12506236">So, the law that came out of Tyson isn't anything new.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.866" offset="12537165">It's the same law that this Court has been applying for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.961" offset="12585544">Also, I might mention that in order for Nebraska to have her way about this case, the case of State of Iowa versus Raymond by the Iowa Supreme Court in 1963 would have to be overruled and disavowed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3585.689" offset="14416414">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.105" offset="14422057">One thing that we think it's important to analyze is a fact, which Iowa apparently is overlooked and that is that when they entered into Compact, they changed the laws along the river to a fix boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.838" offset="14469077">Now, all the five previous riparian laws were based upon the fact that when a person is subject to having his property taken away by moving one of the river, he is subject to having it added to, as the river goes the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.718" offset="14512545">And that is the rationale for all of those arguments, there isn't going to be any decision, which said you can accrete across the state line, usually where you have a movable boundary, because a movable boundary is the same for the state as it is for the private riparian owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.000" offset="14565626">But now we've changed the situation, we entered into a Compact with a fix line and I think that requires an analysis then of, is the rationale still there?</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.466" offset="14603556">Iowa cites all these early common law cases and said this has always been the common law and we don't dispute that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.703" offset="14624454">And in those situations there were presumptions, we can't dispute that, but we can't say we sat down in 1943 and superimposed the new situation by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.626" offset="14656218">And this changed everything required by examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.403" offset="14667294">Iowa likes to use the presumption that the river moved gradually into its location and would argue from that, that therefore in 1943 the river was the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.062" offset="14701880">But the Master's findings negate that fact and the facts and all the mass of evidence in this case negates that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.026" offset="14725809">And if the presumption was that there was a boundary, we didn't need a boundary Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.424" offset="14743363">We recognize it wasn't the boundary and the Master so specifically found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.063" offset="14757887">Iowa utilized the presumptions in this manner and she did so in the Schemmel case, which started trial in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.609" offset="14784114">And then trial has been postponed until the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.077" offset="14798011">But she offered evidence with two witnesses in the Schemmel case and rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.443" offset="14815461">And then I think we've quoted it in the briefs somewhere, counsel stated originally that, initially, they are going to rely on the presumption of gradual movement of the river into its present location.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.049" offset="14857884">So anything on the eastern or left bank side would be in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.114" offset="14870109">At the same time, in interrogatories in this case, Iowa admitted that she knew that a canal was dug in Nebraska in 1938, in that location and yet she's relying on the presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.102" offset="14918070">And the evidence in this case, in the Schemmel case shows a canal a mile long placing the river in the designed channel, along with other movements by dikes and revetments in the Schemmel area, but Iowa, by being able to utilize the presumption puts a tremendous burden on the landowner of coming back in and having to establish how the river got there in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.013" offset="14993720">This means old documents, old witnesses, evidence is gone, it has been lost and destroyed and the Corps of engineers itself was not a record-keeping body.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.076" offset="15038024">And many of its records were thrown away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.359" offset="15047115">So it puts the landowner if he got to rebut that presumption in an extremely difficult position and extremely expensive position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.812" offset="15076894">A tremendous amount of time and effort has been spent in getting evidence in this case; very few farmers could afford that type of litigation or defense of that type of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.893" offset="15125273">We say when Iowa said in Compact that titles will be good.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.482" offset="15139588">Again, we have to determine which ones, but when she says they're good, that doesn't mean that we said we're going to put you now landowner over at Iowa, although she admits they're good she can attack your title at any time and put that tremendous burden upon you to rebut all the presumptions and come in establish that you've got a good title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.880" offset="15205208">We don't think that we send our citizens over there to give them a forum, which changes the jurisdiction, and from the change in jurisdiction, a change of ownership followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.994" offset="15241675">When Iowa said titles good in Nebraska, will be good in Iowa, we say it had to apply to the bed also in both sides because there were many places where both sides of that bed were in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.306" offset="15278873">She didn't say we're going to accept that title and take the title of the bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.375" offset="15291203">So, by saying Iowa law applies, Iowa law is I owns the bed; it's negating completely Iowa's agreement that the title to that part, good in Nebraska would be good in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.831" offset="15357031">Let me conclude them by saying that Nebraska is here as contracting party with a right to enforce the Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.441" offset="15379392">Iowa apparently only wants to enforce Section 1 of the Compact, but we say that if only Section 1 is valid, then we have lost the complete consideration for the remainder of our bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.899" offset="15421293">We feel that the Compact should be read in the manner in which it was intended in 1943 and were that great object can be seen, it should be effectuated and that was to settle and later rest in all of these problems, which existed along the Missouri River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.894" offset="15477299">Thank you.</text>
