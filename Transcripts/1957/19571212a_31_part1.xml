            <label>Mr. Plato E. Papps</label>
            <text syncTime="14.565" offset="58201">Mr. -- Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.996" offset="87980">This case is before the Court on damages awarded to one Marcos Gonzales because of a refusal of the union to clear him for work after his expulsion from the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.826" offset="167288">He based his theory on a contract, breach of contract and the conduct involved was, in our opinion, conduct which is reasonably within the ambit of the National Labor Relations Act and the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.455" offset="245760">The question is whether the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board is displaced where an individual is refused clearance for work under a preferential hiring arrangement after he's been expelled from the union and as a consequence thereof, separate wage loss and under the plaintiff's theory that his conduct was a breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.314" offset="357251">I think the facts can be best summarized in the following fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.691" offset="382746">Marcos Gonzales was a member of the union for a number of years and in 1952, March of 1952 was expelled from the union under an internal union procedure, that is he was expelled because he failed to comply with the penalty imposed by the international president and was subsequently dropped as a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.967" offset="487863">At the time he was dropped, he, for 12 years prior to that time, had been referred for work as a marine machinist in the San Francisco Bay area and I suppose the Oakland area as well through a hiring hall practice in which the union would refer him to work to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.942" offset="579709">A condition -- one of the conditions imposed was membership in the union and that is he was required to show a card or an out of work card before he could be referred for work.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.245" offset="632895">He was out of work from -- as a result of this union conduct from March 1952 until June of 1953 at which time he became ill and incapacitated and in the meanwhile, he brought an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.222" offset="728816">He brought an action in the state court in which he sought damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.446" offset="757760">He sought an order restoring him into union membership on the grounds that he was illegally expelled and he sought damages for loss of earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.883" offset="791510">Between March of 1952, the time that he was expelled from the union, and December when he filed his action, December of 1952, he also filed with the National Labor Relations Board unfair labor practice charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.695" offset="858697">These charges were withdrawn upon advice of his counsel in the subsequent action, the action which is there -- before he was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.312" offset="897149">The -- the trial commenced and in -- in February of 1954, some 13 months later, the complaint was amended to -- to include punitive damages and compensatory damages for mental distress and anguish.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.872" offset="1035389">After trial, there was a -- an award for loss of earnings in the amount of $6800 for actual wage loss and $2500 for damages for mental anguish or mental distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.537" offset="1102054">The chronology thereafter was that the matter was taken to the -- to the California Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.206" offset="1140820">And in the first decision, I might add part two that in the original answer and I think this is quite important, in the original answer to the complaint, the union, the respondent raised the federal question when it alleged that the -- that the Marcos Gonzales had inadequate remedy before the National Labor Relations Board under 8 (b) (1) and 8 (b) (2) of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.385" offset="1261505">Anyway, we got to the Court of Appeals and at that point the first Court of Appeals' decision decided that this matter was preempted that it was a -- a matter that the Court could not control it and dismissed or reversed the court below on the ground that it had no jurisdiction over the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.443" offset="1361711">On rehearing, the Court has reversed itself and said that the entire theory of the plaintiff in this action was a breach of contract that unfair labor practices were not involved and then relying on almost the identical cases it had previously decided in the first instance stated that in each of these cases, Real v. Curran and Born versus Laube that -- that in those cases, the issue of an unfair labor practice was actually raised and was an issue at the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.150" offset="1512594">He said however, “That was not raised and it was not an issue here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="382.441" offset="1529731">It ignored the fact that the -- on the record, the testimony showed that Gonzales had filed an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.848" offset="1563376">It ignored the fact that the -- in addition to that -- and also that the answer had raised the -- the unfair labor practice issue, the federal question that is now before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.352" offset="1669329">We contend that the -- I might go on and I should say that following that, we took an appeal to file to the Supreme Court of the State of California and the hearing was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.154" offset="1716558">Subsequent to that in January of this year, a petition for writ of certiorari was filed in and it was granted this October and that's how this case is before this Court in this posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.659" offset="1774550">We contend that the conduct involved here that is the failure of the union to clear Marcos Gonzales for work after his expulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.596" offset="1814361">It's a common unfair labor practice that I -- I don't think we even have to go beyond the fact that it is an 8 (b) (2) and the courts have so held, the Board has so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.856" offset="1863367">The rather reason on this ground is that it need not even being said that the conduct is necessarily an unfair labor practice if the conduct is reasonably within the ambit of either protected activity under Section 7 of the Act or within the proscriptions of Section 8 of the Act then the conduct is still within the exclusive control and jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.484" offset="1973917">I think that proposition is pointed out in the Webber case which spells that out very clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.873" offset="2019474">We additionally urge to the Court that the following factors do not displace federal preemption and that is whether or not the action was based on a breach of contract rather than a -- alleging any conduct of 8 (b) (2) where the conduct itself is reasonably within the scope of -- of 8 (b) (2) or 8 (b) (1) or any other such illegal conduct in the Section 8 or where a mental -- mental distress is alleged does not displace the exclusiveness of the National Labor Relations Board with respect to a common unfair labor practice or where the question involved is the restoration of the member to membership and the damages that float from there.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.925" offset="2223647">If Congress had intended that this type of conduct was within the ambit and control of the State under the proviso of the Section 8 (b) (1) that is where it can control restoration to a membership of an individual because the proviso to 8 (b) (1) indicates a clear congressional intent that it did not wish to control the retention or the right of a labor organization to prescribe its own rules with respect to the acquisition or retention of membership therein and certainly intended that -- that should be left open to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.614" offset="2402429">If Congress had intended as well that the State should then take and couple with that right that is the restoration to membership in a union, any loss of wages that may afloat from the discrimination or the conduct involved as a result of the expulsion of the individual from the union and it certainly could have enacted a proviso to Section 8 (b) (2) which would have clearly given that right to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.523" offset="2542028">It's perfectly obvious that the Congress did not intend that once the State restored the individual membership that it should also occupy that portion of the federal scheme in which an individual can be restored to membership and may call under in an unfair labor practice charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.507" offset="2637949">Indeed, if these contract remedies to anything else, they show that the -- that they impair the federal regulatory scheme and then in our opinion we would have a multiplicity of suits wherever there is 8 (b) (2) conduct because the individual in question could choose his form as to whether or not he could go to the Labor Board or go to a State Court for redress under this area of alleged conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.454" offset="2905757">I think, it's fair to say that under the approach, we urge here that is that the State can regulate the membership of an individual in the union that that is left to it by the National Labor Relations Act and that the conduct involved that is the refusal to clear or to redress for loss of wages is left to the federal scheme, gives both of the federal -- gives both the Federal and the State interest or proper ordinance without conflict keeps them in their proper perspective and their interest are preserved.</text>

            <text syncTime="798.983" offset="3195925">I'll try to focus it, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.595" offset="3214315">There -- I think that first of all, this is not an appropriate case in which this Court can consider the question, whether a state court can award damages to one who has been expelled from a trade union even if there is an unfair labor practice involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.507" offset="3301982">I think that this is not an appropriate case because I don't believe that the record supports or would support a finding that there was an unfair labor practice in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.410" offset="3353600">But secondly, I say that if there was an unfair labor practice in fact here that the award made by the state court was an appropriate award, it does not conflict with the federal jurisdiction or the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board nor purport to supplant it in any way, but it is a proper exercise of the power of the state court to regulate the affairs of unincorporated associations within its borders.</text>
