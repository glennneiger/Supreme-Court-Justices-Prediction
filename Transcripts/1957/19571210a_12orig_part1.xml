            <text syncTime="133.827" offset="535301">Now the main thing that Virginia had instructed its commissioners to seek when they met with the commissioners from the State of Maryland was ownership in the southern shore of the Potomac River in Virginia and in its citizens with full right of navigation, commerce and fishery in the river proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.682" offset="610638">The main thing that the State of Maryland had instructed its commissioners to seek was free and unrestrained, untaxed navigation for its vessels in commerce through the Virginia capes.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.940" offset="659749">When the compact was drawn up each state got it what it desired and what it sought and in 1786 each state by their general assembles sitting respectively in Annapolis and Richmond ratified and confirmed the compact of 1785 as drawn up and presented to them by these five commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.399" offset="753580">The compact contained 13 paragraphs or provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.339" offset="773329">Paragraphs one through six, nine and 12 dealt with the respective rights of navigation and commerce between the two states on the Potomac River and on the Chesapeake Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.053" offset="824111">Paragraph seven and eight relate to property, riparian and fishing rights and regulations on the Potomac River and on the Pocomoke River.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.082" offset="860264">Paragraph 10 related to -- or relates to criminal jurisdiction on the Potomac, Pocomoke and Chesapeake Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.612" offset="890358">Paragraph 11 concerns civil jurisdiction over these same bodies of waters and the ports thereon.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.900" offset="919510">Paragraph 13 provides how the compact was to become effective and how it was to be ratified and the effect of it once it had been ratified by the two contracting states.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.728" offset="966844">Now although the compact gave the Virginia and its citizen's full property rights in the southern shores of the Potomac River, there was still a dispute from time to time as to the actual location of the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.896" offset="1019507">And this was not definitely determined -- the boundary was not definitely surveyed and determined until 1877 in the Black-Jenkins Award when the arbitrators Black and Jenkins one from Georgia, and one from Pennsylvania stated that in view of the compact and view of the acceptance of the compact by both states and the associates of each state that it was undisputable that the boundary was fixed at the low water mark on the southern shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.091" offset="1132356">However, that they would describe it by points of longitude and latitude and by point description and also provided that it would not fall on the indentations of coves and bays but it would run from headland to headland on southern shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.833" offset="1203304">Now there have been from time to time violations of the laws on the Potomac by the both the citizens of Virginia and the citizens of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.702" offset="1238727">These laws, up until this year, have been enforced on the river relating to fishery, have always been, with the mutual consent and approbation by the legislatures of both state.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.047" offset="1280104">Last Fall unfortunately there was again a flare for trouble between law of enforcement officials and citizens, especially citizens of a certain section of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.417" offset="1329633">And my just in sad remark say that three -- four citizens of Virginia who were arrested by Maryland officials have been extradited to Maryland and one has been tried and the other three are waiting trial, but winter of this year in Maryland general assembly met in Minneapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.869" offset="1403402">It passed two statutes both of which is contention of Virginia invades and violates the rights of Virginia which were given to the state of Virginia by the compact of 1785.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.604" offset="1450318">The first one of these statutes is chapter 766 of the laws of Maryland of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.043" offset="1476127">This chapter after setting up intention of legislature to repeal the compact did repeal the enacting statute of Maryland chapter one of 1785 which in effect repealed by Maryland or was attempted unilateral repeal by Maryland to repeal the compact of 1785.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.192" offset="1812689">So there was a provision as to how it could be changed or repealed by mutual consent and then the enacting clause of respective legislatures also carried out same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.747" offset="1998890">The second statute enacted by legislature or the general assembly of Maryland this present year is chapter 770 of the Acts of Maryland of 1957, which act in the language used by the State of Maryland and the legislature of that state in passing that statute provides as follows, “that it is a legislative intent in the enactment of this law to vest in State of Maryland all licensing provisions concerning the taking of fish or oysters, crabs and plants from Potomac river to give to the State of Maryland and its law enforcement officers complete control and jurisdiction over such fishes in the Potomac River and to give the residents of Virginia an equal right citizens of Maryland and use enjoyment of such fishes to be exercised solely under the laws of State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.509" offset="2190002">Now this is in direct conflict with the provision of Article 8 of a compact which provided that any laws and regulations for the preservation of fish in Potomac River should be enacted with mutual consent and approbation of the legislatures of each state.</text>

            <text syncTime="2114.317" offset="8457195">This Court in decision of the Maryland versus West Virginia held that not the award of 1877 but in effect the compact of 1785 fixed the boundary between Virginia and Maryland fixed -- and also fixed the boundary between West Virginia Maryland and West Virginia broke off from Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.612" offset="8522397">It had also fixed the boundary between Virginia and the District of Columbia because a compact was decided and agreed upon in 1785 and Maryland didn't cede (Inaudible) to the District of Columbia to the federal government until 1789, four years after the compact and that the boundary had already been fixed on the lower watermark on the Virginia shore four years before this territory was given to the District of Columbia by the State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.773" offset="8643082">And this decision Maryland versus West Virginia has not been questioned, but it has been reiterated by at least two lower federal courts Washington Airport versus Smoot Sand &amp; Gravel Corporation 44 federal second 342, and Marine Railway versus United States 265 federal 437, and also by the highest court of the State of Maryland in the already cited case of Barnes versus State of Maryland all of which said that it had many questions about what the compact did that this Court's decision in Maryland versus West Virginia said that the compact did in effect established the boundary between Virginia and Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.522" offset="8798041">Both we have an addition to this proprietary right in the southern shore, the compact fixed certain fishery and riparian rights both of which this Court has held our property and which can be vested and which are viable and which cannot be taken from a person without due compensation Yates versus Milwaukee 10 wall 497 was the one holding riparian rights of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.287" offset="8893127">McCready versus Virginia 94 US 391, and Holyoke Water Park versus (Inaudible), both which hold that fishery rights of property rights and valuable rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.521" offset="8933982">But in addition to that to any property rights we feel that an absence of showing a property right that Virginia has a, as a sovereign state a right to invoke the original jurisdiction in this case because of the quasi sovereign rights which it passed to look at the interest of its people as outlined in the already mentioned case by Mr. Justice Frankfurter of Missouri versus Illinois and by two cases where the state of Georgia invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, Georgia versus Tennessee Copper Company 206 US 230 and Georgia versus Pennsylvania Railroad Company 324 US 439.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.637" offset="9102524">In the first case we have an industry in the State of Tennessee which was causing harm to property in the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.617" offset="9130423">This Court said the State of Georgia itself had titled very little property, but it had the right and the duty to look after the interest of its citizens whose property was being damaged and destroyed by this noxious gas being discharged by an industry in another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.112" offset="9192385">And in Georgia versus Pennsylvania Railroad, this Court said that the State of Georgia had a right to look after the economy of the state and the right of its citizens to not being discriminated against in rate fixing by the railroad and at the state has parens patriae, had a right to come into this Court and that that right long had been recognized by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.298" offset="9285172">Now the State of Maryland cites a Washington versus Smoot Sand and Gravel Company among others in saying that there is no property right in Virginia, in the salt of the bed of Potomac River.</text>

            <text syncTime="2405.689" offset="9622674">This compact was a contract not entered into by some 800 fisherman, but rather entered into by the State of Virginia in a sovereign capacity, a sovereign capacity which was existing before the constitution was ratified and also by the State of Maryland in its sovereign capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.405" offset="9685577">In Pennsylvania versus West Virginia, 262 US 553 this Court said that a complaint state could come in to redress a wrong which would be done to its citizens and to look after the interest of its citizens at large by a sister state and could invoke the original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.960" offset="9763840">Now a number of cases cited by the State of Maryland contending it's port side view that this is merely action on behalf of certain private citizens with Maryland loaning its name.</text>

            <text syncTime="2481.934" offset="9927680">And the case was South Dakota versus North Carolina 192 US 286 where a private citizen had given, made an outright gift of bonds to the state which that citizen has gotten from North Carolina was, North Carolina (Inaudible) the state said, I mean this Court the State of South Dakota could invoke the original jurisdiction to collect that debt even though it was just a few thousand dollars, and even though this private citizen had many more thousand dollars that he was hoping the benefit would adhere to him, by this Court, the Court permitting the original jurisdiction to be invoked.</text>

            <text syncTime="3353.247" offset="13412937">Now if Your Honors please, my brother has glossed over the facts in background of this thing somewhat, and I think it's important that we go into the background of this case to see exactly what we have here and why we have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.106" offset="13472392">Now prior to 1785, we were then under the Articles of Confederation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.449" offset="13501753">The Constitution had not been dreamed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.812" offset="13511158">In fact this Court had not -- the thought of this Court and had even been conceived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.704" offset="13530802">Now under the tangled relationship between the states that existed in 1785, there was no central authority, each state was an independent sovereign nation only bound together for a common offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.191" offset="13588689">With that in view and with an unsettled boundary question that existed back to the 1600's, Maryland and Virginia had two major controversies between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.669" offset="13634664">First there was a conflict as to jurisdiction over the Potomac, the Pocomoke Rivers and parts of the Chesapeake Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.180" offset="13668624">Secondly there was a dispute over collection of tolls by Virginia on vessels passing through the Virginia Capes to Baltimore, Maryland's major port and also a controversy on the collection of tolls by Maryland on vessels coming up the Potomac River to Alexandria which was an important port at that time on the Potomac River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.050" offset="13760157">Now prior to 1785, which would indicate that the boundary issue was not important at that time, Virginia, by the adoption of its first constitution in 1776, surrendered all claims it had to territories claimed by other states contained within her charter with the exception of the free navigation and use of the rivers Potomac and Pocomoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.696" offset="13874782">Now Virginia in 1776 disclaimed any title to the Potomac River.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.944" offset="13903726">Its some nine years before the compact was conceived and at that time the compact did not deal with the boundary dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.244" offset="13936953">It dealt with jurisdictional disputes, because we had no central government and because we had two independent nations at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.249" offset="13972898">Now, Virginia originally made this call for the compact sir, and they, according to their own call, wished to adjust and confirm the rights of each to use, to the use of navigation and jurisdiction over these two rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.061" offset="14040189">Based upon this premise a meeting was called in 1777 at the request of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.917" offset="14071641">It's unimportant why this meeting was unsuccessful, but be it known that it was unsuccessful and nothing came out of the 1777 meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.102" offset="14116362">Now Maryland's consideration for the compact was to have Virginia relinquish every claim to impose tolls on any vessels sailing through the Virginia Capes to Maryland and this was a condition and the instructions to the Maryland delegates sine qua non.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.315" offset="14189192">If there was any reason that this could not be gotten, Marylanders would have come home without any compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.686" offset="14214687">Now what was the call as to fishing rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.000" offset="14223987">There was no mention whatsoever in the call, or no mention in the original negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.442" offset="14253767">After we had that situation, a conference was held at George Washington's home at Mount Vernon in March of 1785 and I think it's important to note that, that was some ten months prior to the action of the Virginia General Assembly, which started the ball rolling for a constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.051" offset="14340180">The General Assembly of Virginia asked for a call of delegates for the adoption of a constitution, this was some ten months before that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3596.286" offset="14385110">What are the major provisions of the compact?</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.955" offset="14395768">What was the intention of the drafters of the compact?</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.493" offset="14409874">My brother has included that as exhibits in his -- attached to his Bill of Compliant and Articles I through VI which are the prime articles of this compact deal with navigation of these rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.637" offset="14474449">They further deal with the vessels of war of both states which recognize at that time that each state had the power to make war and had the power to have vessels of war and it made the Potomac River a common highway for the purposes of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.837" offset="14547278">Article VII ensured to citizens of both states full property rights which then existed in each state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.614" offset="14578416">It didn't grant anything new.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.658" offset="14586567">It kept the status quo as to property rights and also kept the status quo as to fishing rights, which they had both enjoyed in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.427" offset="14629616">It wasn't a grant, it was ensuring of the present situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4255.307" offset="17021179">And secondly said and I think this is very important that we will -- they have a right to protect their citizens because they infect the citizens of the entire state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.104" offset="17068408">And the Court made a very important point of that, that it wasn't an isolated section of the state or a small portion of the state they were protecting, but they were protecting substantial part or the entire state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4280.780" offset="17123056">Now let's look at what Virginia claimed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.959" offset="17135804">We have four or five counties in the northern neck of Virginia, Virginia is approximately a 100 counties affected.</text>

            <text syncTime="4317.752" offset="17270909">The Commonwealth isn't adversely affected by the action of Maryland nor the citizens frankly because they still are out on that river today fishing and oystering and they will continue under the acts of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.012" offset="17320020">The acts of Maryland were to discriminate against Virginians.</text>

            <text syncTime="6340.730" offset="25362913">In fact I am saying that's what the Attorney General -- that's what the Attorney General of Virginia, that's what Virginia submits to this Court, I don't know whether it is so or not, I don't know whether any of these facts are so without bringing into question the good faith of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6353.679" offset="25414635">Now assume that is so, and assume Virginia has said that she does say that she is interfered with, in the exercise of what she conceives to be a governmental function.</text>
            <text syncTime="6368.077" offset="25472209">Abstractly stated, abstractly stated if that were true namely that what Maryland is doing in fact makes inroads on the capacity of Virginia to carry out what she conceives to be a governmental function, will that be in interest of the State of Virginia which is fairly sustainable under a compact with Maryland, would that be a justiciable issue in this Court?</text>

            <text syncTime="6412.027" offset="25648065">I do raise, I raise another point, but before I leave it, I do want to finish with page 26 of the original pleading and refer again to the cause, just before Section 2 begins in the Maryland statute approving the compact and I point out that that clause does not appear in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="6444.630" offset="25778469">But certainly the idea behind this clause permeates the whole reason for and a manner in which the compact should have been carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6460.186" offset="25840744">That is good faith and if executed meaning carried out not merely signed but carried out, executed with good faith will perpetuate harmony, friendship and good offices between two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="6476.663" offset="25906573">Now that of course is a whole point of this controversy between Maryland and Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="6485.324" offset="25941264">The facts are that and I think it can be shown that Virginia has considered this compact at least since the adoption of a federal constitution as a matter of all take by Virginia and all put by Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="6501.950" offset="26007719">It has not been carried out in good faith by Virginia mounting up over the years to a rescission by Virginia which we have merely formalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="6512.730" offset="26050873">Now before my time has expired I'd like to point out a technical reason why this particular suit should not be entertained in this Court at this time and that technical reason is that even if the compact is considered to be subsisting, either state has the right to offer legislation for concurrence by the other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="6536.108" offset="26144392">In effect, if under that bill that the compact is still in existence, still subsists, this legislation can only be considered as an offer to Virginia, as an offer to Virginia even considering the compact as an effect, which Maryland denies as an offer or proper to Virginia of repealing legislation and conservation legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6562.690" offset="26250658">All we know as yet Virginia might agree to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6566.616" offset="26266436">Virginia legislature has not met since the Maryland legislature passed this legislation.</text>
