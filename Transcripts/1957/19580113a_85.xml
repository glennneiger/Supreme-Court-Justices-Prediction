            <label>Mr. Joe Rolston</label>
            <text syncTime="420.063" offset="1680196">That's the only question that we have before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.504" offset="1697959">But we do not want to be construe their saying that we think it's necessary to fix price in order to conserve gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.206" offset="1752816">There's adequate machinery under the many state enactments governing that phase of conservation which we think are adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.716" offset="1794821">Before discussing the -- the material portion, the order involved in this lawsuit, I think maybe it would be helpful for this Court to know that this price fixing feature is -- is nothing new back in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.578" offset="1914253">The State of Oklahoma fixed a seven-cent price for gas produced and sold in the Oklahoma portion of the Hugoton Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.898" offset="1983530">In 1948 after the Oklahoma procedure had taken place, the Kansas Commission fixed an eight-cent price for natural gas produce and sold in the Kansas portion of the Hugoton Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.009" offset="2083944">Then in 1952, the Oklahoma Commission each within new order in which they fixed the price at 9.8262.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.018" offset="2152072">Then in 1954, effective January 1st, 1954, the Kansas Commission issued this order, fixing 11-cent price and changing the pressure base which constitutes approximately a 12-cent price with the change in the pressure base.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.750" offset="2278922">Now, I want to quote a small portion of the -- of the order that's under consideration because it to me is self-explanatory and I think directly answers Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.714" offset="2390831">Here's what they say, it's on page 45 of the record, the order says this that all persons, firms or corporations which take gas or cost a gas to be taken from Hugoton gas field in Kansas on and after January 1st, 1954, 12:01 a.m. shall as a condition present or withdraw from the common source of supply pay or attribute to all gas taken, except gas for the operation of leases for all purposes including payments to producers, landowners, lease owners and royalty owners the fair and the reasonable minimum price of not less than 11 cents per Mcf, 14.65 pounds psi at the wellhead until a further order of this Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.739" offset="2742857">Now, the portion of the order that answers the question is that says -- part which says for all purposes including payments to producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.111" offset="2808372">Now, it starts out that all persons, firms or corporations which take or cost gas to be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.560" offset="2842227">We certainly take gas from the field because we have a pipeline in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.792" offset="2875141">And if the Court will turn to Exhibit 34 at page 79 of the record, the Court will find set for a complete map of the pipeline system of Cities Service Gas Company showing its gas fields from which it takes its gas or purchase its gas and it shows the vast Hugoton Field there and the Panhandle Field in Texas and some other fields in Oklahoma and Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.820" offset="3139187">The Court will observe that this Hugoton gas field which the Commission has said and I think we can agree as the largest gas field in the world, lies on three states, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.057" offset="3228212">Now, as I made the point at the start, we are not contesting or claiming.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.654" offset="3290593">The state does not have any power to fix a minimum price for natural gas produced and sold in interstate commerce as against constitutional objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.358" offset="3353391">But when you bring in the provisions of the Natural Gas Act, which this Court considered in the case of Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America v. Panoma Corporation and some other cases in a per curiam opinion, 349 U.S. 44 and Phillips Petroleum Company v. State of Wisconsin et al. in 347 U.S. 672.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.772" offset="3519007">It is our contention than as to any sale of gas made in any -- in interstate commerce for resale that this Court has held by the Phillips case and the Panoma case and as reinforced by the plain language of the Natural Gas Act which in Section 1 (b) says that the Act shall apply to the sale in interstate commerce of natural gas for resale and the Natural Gas Company is engaged in such sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="1194.233" offset="4776856">From what has been heretofore stated, it appears that the sales of gas made by producers in the field to the gas company in the first instance after production and gathering had entered and in the second after production -- in the first after production had ceased and in the second after production and gathering had entered where sales in interstate commerce of natural gas or resale for ultimate public consumption for domestic, commercial, industrial or other uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.403" offset="4929515">It also appears in such record that after such sales had been completed the gas company placed such gas in its interstate integrated pipeline system and thereafter made resale thereof to at least of some of the appellant cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.828" offset="5011226">Now, there was involved in this litigation in the lower court some Kansas municipalities which were also attacking the validity order on the same grounds in which we were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.763" offset="5079040">But the cities have not sought a review in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.555" offset="5118119">Now, in answer to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question awhile ago, I believe it was and maybe it was you, Mr. Chief Justice, what the Kansas Court did, they said on page 98 of the opinion, they construe this price order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1318.258" offset="5272973">The parties are far apart on their construction of the Commission's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.124" offset="5312470">On the one hand, the appellants contend such order as a price fixing order having application to sales of natural gas made by producers after its production and gathering has entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.751" offset="5378926">On the other hand, the Commission contend, it is purely a conservation measure limited to production of gas from the common source of supply before sensation of production which makes the minimum attribution price therein prescribed, a condition precedent to the withdrawal of any natural gas whatsoever from such source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.407" offset="5493551">We are not inclined with the labor arguments made by the parties respecting the construction to be given the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.544" offset="5530122">It suffices to say that after a careful analysis thereof, we have no difficulty in construing its terms to me that no person, firm or corporation, first of all, the producers and left or take gas in its natural state from the depths of the Hugoton Field to a point further than the wellhead without as a condition precedent to its withdrawal from the common source of supply first attributing thereto a minimum price of not less than 11 cents per Mcf, 14.65 pounds psi, so construed recognizing as we must that under our own decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.105" offset="5760418">Now, right there, they cite Kansas Nebraska Natural Gas Company be the corporation commission which that court had upheld and sustained an eight-cent price order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.317" offset="5845264">The -- the order in the two cases is exactly the same except as to price and the Court said so in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.892" offset="5903464">Now, in the Kansas-Nebraska case that case was never appealed to this Court or a review was never sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.415" offset="5957590">And the Kansas Court said that that was the fixed law of Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.863" offset="5983399">Now, in the Kansas-Nebraska case, the companies -- pipeline companies' involved taking gas from the field, took the gas in one or two ways by production, their own production or by purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.176" offset="6068663">In our case here, it's solely by purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.779" offset="6083082">We do not produce in the Kansas Hugoton Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.329" offset="6101264">Now, the Court said in the Kansas-Nebraska case that they have the power to fix that deal price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.246" offset="6144940">Then they came along in the Columbia fuel, the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company, a case in 176 Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.305" offset="6209202">It was decided just a few years after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.699" offset="6230727">And in that case, they held that Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company under that eight-cent order was required to pay the producer not only the eight cents fixed by the price order at the wellhead, but also in addition thereto the cost of gathering the gas and the contract provided that the producer should pay the cost of gathering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.802" offset="6407105">That is the sale under the contract was made at the end of production and gathering in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.209" offset="6448797">Now, there's many question but what there is a substantial disagreement between the appellees and the appellants in this case with respect to the -- what the Kansas Court decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.856" offset="6539389">I think probably that the best evidence of what the Court decided was that the company, after the Court's opinion was handed down and then accordance with this rules, filed a motion for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.714" offset="6690795">And in this motion for rehearing, we specifically asked the Kansas Court to clarify its judgment and decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3868.105" offset="15472327">I'll put it that way and try to describe what has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.317" offset="15489254">As you know the Act provides for filings and these three and half years since Phillips, they have been engulfed with filings by different producers over the country, some 19,000 better than 19,000 different filings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.112" offset="15552366">Now, the Act doesn't say just because a man or producer files a paper in which he describes a certain rate which they were directed to do under the Federal Power Commission's order 174 that that -- the filing of it makes the Federal Power Commission's failure to do anything at that point an approval of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.725" offset="15646824">The Federal Power Commission must act within 30 days under Section 4, if it wants to suspend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.498" offset="15681933">It can come in under Section 5 (a) at anytime and examine into the rate and it can -- and that mere filing doesn't involve any affirmative action by the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.260" offset="15752986">On this situation, there were two cases that I want to briefly describe to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.828" offset="15771272">One is the Magnolia case in which there was an application as described in the footnote to our brief for -- of price-wise because of this Kansas order and there was also the application of Cities Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.648" offset="15838563">When that application was first filed, it included the contract between the parties and the minimal price order and also the agreement that Cities Service have made whereby the producers that got this higher price because of this minimum price order would have to refund it to Cities Service if it was later declared illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.594" offset="15938351">And the Commission first made it subject to that provision and then later, they eliminated that part.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.680" offset="15974713">The explanation I was given by the Federal Power Commission was that the elimination of it being subject to this provision of refund, if the courts would hold it illegal, was to not interfere with the court action and the court determination as to what the effect of this minimum price order would be and that case is not final.</text>
            <text syncTime="4018.845" offset="16075337">It's now on appeal to the Tenth Circuit so that the Court can determine what the legal effect of this minimum price order is in regard to these contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.150" offset="16124552">Now, we're talking about a sum of $4 million increase on the price of gas in this very case so that it is a -- a very substantial sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.001" offset="16175961">And you and I know that it isn't going to be paid down the bottom of the line to the producer without coming out the end here from the consumer.</text>

            <text syncTime="4155.788" offset="16623073">They took the difference between the minimum price for the (Inaudible) and the basic contract orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.104" offset="16656405">Now, it's the position of the Federal Power Commission if they're going to have to examine the whole question and take into account Mobile and its effect on this matter if the Court should -- should decide that this minimum price order is illegal because under Mobile, they would have no power without a 5 (a) hearing to step in and just change the price that would have to be paid to these producers in the face of their contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="6097.490" offset="24389904">In -- in short, a particle use and waste of this irreplaceable natural resource came into being.</text>
            <text syncTime="6105.441" offset="24421669">And the evidence show that -- that there was a real relationship between treating this gas as a valueless or virtually valueless commodity and these wastes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6119.534" offset="24478093">The record shows how this happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="6122.284" offset="24489064">There were various wildcatters and the independents who first discovered the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="6127.156" offset="24508604">There were just a few pipelines in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6130.630" offset="24522501">It wasn't economically feasible to market this gas or to build a pipeline to market gas even from the largest wells or the 10 largest wells in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="6142.394" offset="24569522">You can't carry gas in the bucket like cooking oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="6145.803" offset="24583210">You can't transport it from the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="6147.446" offset="24589688">You can't put it on a rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="6149.601" offset="24598361">There's only one way to get it there and that's through pipelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="6152.467" offset="24609855">And these pipelines constituted monopolies out there and the small independents and the producers were captive suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6162.264" offset="24649038">And they fought for connections and they lost some leases trying to get connections.</text>
            <text syncTime="6169.205" offset="24676728">It cost about $25 to $30 million to build a pipeline.</text>
            <text syncTime="6173.578" offset="24694282">And these pipeline companies, instead of giving the connections, and this is all in the record, instead of giving them connections, it would buy a lease right next to their leases and they drain their gas up from under them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6186.395" offset="24745482">And so these independent producers, they wouldn't buy their gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="6192.328" offset="24769306">They refuse to buy their gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="6193.986" offset="24775889">Well, I'll have to continue this --</text>
