            <label>Mr. John S. Lynch, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="8.605" offset="34377">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.988" offset="47856">Earlier in argument, question was asked relative to taking by the United States of America of a property of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.504" offset="85995">Now, there is a property dedicated previously to a governmental use.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.644" offset="110550">There have been cases from this Court where that type of property has been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.006" offset="131971">And the Carmack case, I think is a typical example of that type of taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.763" offset="150988">But in all of those cases where -- where the property was public property either it was held in a proprietary capacity or in such as the Carmack case actually the City in that particular case was agreeable to the taking for Post Office purposes but the land had been conveyed by a -- a party to the City with a limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.253" offset="240953">Many years before enactment, the true party in interest in that case was the heir of the earlier ancestor they had conveyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.276" offset="273032">And the question was not posed actually of the taking of the governmental property in the sense that the taking of governmental property is posed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.858" offset="319425">I don't say that the Government cannot take the property for its higher purposes because certainly it can.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.222" offset="344816">But a non-expressed purpose in the statute would be it seems to me a strained purpose to take property which the State for its own sovereign purpose is -- has determined is for the State's sovereign needs such as the State of Washington has in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.811" offset="427154">Now, one other question that was posed was the question, “Could a private corporation or private utility take the property?”</text>
            <text syncTime="115.871" offset="463412">In the case -- in the lower court from which this action is taken, the Washington court and its on page 283 of the record, the court discusses in that -- that was a case of a taking by a railroad corporation of land in the port town scenario of the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.720" offset="602802">And the taking by the railroad corporation was denied in that case because the property had been dedicated to the governmental use.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.542" offset="630073">But the Court point -- pointed out there and points out here that the cases where the State of Washington has recognized the taking of its property for utility purpose is where the property has held in a proprietary capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.089" offset="680333">And -- and I'm satisfied that if a type of a private corporation sought to take state property that the same objection would be posed at that time that is -- was posed in this case which I refer to here.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.957" offset="743758">To make clear on the question of the Public Utility District, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe you asked about the possibility of -- of Pierce County, the Rural Pierce County forming a public utility district can take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.840" offset="795272">Public utility districts in the State of Washington are authorized to take land either within or without their boarders.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.719" offset="830798">I mean on Page 32 of my brief and I'll just read the short sentence there, “And the district may erect within or without its limits dams or other works across any river or water -- water course and so forth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="223.301" offset="893179">So the -- the taking is not limited inside the area of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.022" offset="920033">I might state that this property is not located in Pierce County.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.517" offset="934034">It is located in Louise County which is some two -- well, it joins on the Pierce County on the southern end.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.373" offset="965486">There is a public utility district in Louise County.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.593" offset="982309">There might be some problem posed under the state law if a public utility district from, say Pierce County should attempt to condemn property in the area in which another public utility district were currently operating and also seeking the same property.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.613" offset="1054407">That question has never been determined and I would hesitate to advise the Court what the final result would be.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="271.104" offset="1084395">(Inaudible) locate actually its extents was not acceptable?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_s_lynch_jr" startTime="281.592" stopTime="956.505">
            <label>Mr. John S. Lynch, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="281.592" offset="1126296">The purpose of the objection, Mr. Justice Brennan, as I understand that -- is not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.199" offset="1156702">There was an objection of the state Game and Fish Departments that the hatchery being a successful operation, I mean being the most successful of all the hatchery operations in the State because of the fact that the plant from that hatchery brought a greater return from the fish than any other hatcheries that they didn't wish to have it taken for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.405" offset="1253564">Now, there was an offer of relocation but the state countered the -- their question was why if instead of relocating our hatchery, why don't you lower your dam?</text>
            <text syncTime="324.733" offset="1298913">I mean and that was the counter proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.261" offset="1308944">So I mean it left at somewhat of an impasse on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.120" offset="1324408">Now, one other thing I -- one other statement I think should be called at the Court's attention and it shows at Page 177 of the record and that is that it involves -- it involves a construction of Section 21 of the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.603" offset="1414374">Now, that was an action which was instituted by the City of Tacoma in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, the Southern Division with officers in Tacoma before the Honorable Judge Boldt.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.134" offset="1468500">A -- a challenge was taken to the action of the City to institute the action in that court and Judge Boldt in an opinion in the form of a letter to counsel advised them and this is the copy of it that the motion to dismiss and challenge the City's authority to act under Section 21 in that court was well taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.555" offset="1558152">And he held as he holds here that the Federal Government does not have authority to remove limitations on the powers of Washington City is expressly provided by the legislature and accordingly Section 21 which grants the right of eminent domain and the District Courts does not remove the limitation on condemnation powers of Washington City's.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.891" offset="1643520">As a result of that and he provides, as you will note that, an order in conformity that therewith may be presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.125" offset="1672464">Now, what happened was that at conclusion -- I mean as soon as the counsel before the City obtained -- were advised of the opinion of Judge Boldt, a voluntary nonsuit was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.505" offset="1721992">I mean the action never was prosecuted to final judgment in the proceeding but there had -- there was this determination by the District Court in the form of this correspondence stating the position of the District Court specifically on Section 21 of the Federal Power Act which is actually the statute which is before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.128" offset="1812480">And now, I'd like to turn myself to a discussion of the question of whether or not Section 21 of the Federal Power Act is actually a grant of the power of eminent domain as counsel for the Government and for the City contend or whether it is rather a statute providing for venue in jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.175" offset="1916656">Now, certainly, the statute by its latter provisions is a statute having to do with jurisdiction because after the proviso clause, it provides that jurisdiction may be had in the federal court if the amount in controversy exceeds $3000 and so that portion of the statute certainly is one of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.335" offset="2001293">The question then presents itself, does the provision of the section which states that the licensee may acquire the same, referring to the property to be sought, by the exercise of the right of eminent domain in the District Court of the United States for the district in which such land or other property may be located.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.568" offset="2086243">The question is, is that a grant of the power of eminent domain or is it a grant of the right of venue in the District Court of the land in which the property may be located?</text>
            <text syncTime="532.932" offset="2131696">Now, the District Court of Missouri in the Union Electric or the State of Missouri Ex Rel. Camden County vs. Union Electric held that it was a grant of the federal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.093" offset="2176313">And that the licensee did have the power to exercise eminent domain under this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.255" offset="2200973">But the -- I hope this is right Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.369" offset="2233469">This Court has never construed Section 21 of the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.611" offset="2246426">It has mentioned that in passing on at least three or four occasions but it has never construed the Act and the Act generally has been brought and there are a number of cases from Nebraska where Nebraska Public Power District which are somewhat similar to the public utility districts of the State of Washington have gone into the federal courts and condemned the land in the State of Nebraska with no diversity of citizenship being involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.752" offset="2354991">And if it were not for the grant that this statute gives to the City of Tacoma, it would not be possible for the City of Tacoma to go into the federal court and condemn the land in Louise County which is in the same State with Washington and actually, it's in the same judicial district, the southern -- the western district southern division.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.419" offset="2441613">Now, the United States of America could proceed in the federal court against the property but eminent domain being in and around proceeding is normally bought in the county in which the land is situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.966" offset="2487798">The purposes for that being that that is where the record of the property is kept and the proceeding is not against the owner of the land but against the particular track of land and who gets the money that is paid in compensation is to be determined by whoever has a right to the property as to the records.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.949" offset="2559791">Now, it must be assumed that the Federal Power Commission would not grant a license to build a project to anyone that didn't have powers of eminent domain in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.170" offset="2620604">It speaks of the persons and -- or the different groups that might bring the action, mention States while eminent domain is one of the attributes of sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.012" offset="2656026">Certainly, the State would have the power of eminent domain and municipal corporations for municipal purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.916" offset="2683611">As far as I know, will have the right of eminent domain granted to it by the Sovereign State which created it or authorized it.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.199" offset="2720705">And private utility companies which would seek to obtain a license from the Federal Power Commission as one of their powers would have the right of eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.889" offset="2759471">But the one thing that they would not have would be to -- the right to go into the United States District Court to acquire the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.965" offset="2795833">They would normally be held to go into the court -- the county court of the county or the state court of the county in which the land is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.163" offset="2832614">And the provisions of this statute granting that right are something over and additional to the right that the normal licensee would have.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.326" offset="2869290">And it seems to me from the phraseology of the section that what it actually has given is the right to use the federal courts for the eminent domain proceeding and that is a venue, not a grant of power section.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.583" offset="2934282">It's a grant of the right to use the venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.947" offset="2963749">The history of the Federal Power Act as I read it in the Congressional Record is the various parts with any references to Section 21 of the Federal Power Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.367" offset="3005440">The major portion of the discussion in the record had to do with the question of whether or not there would be the -- the $3,000 limitation for the right to use the federal courts and that was placed in.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.475" offset="3061864">But the history of the Federal Power Act indicates that it was not brought as a -- actually, it wasn't brought as a limitation on the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.669" offset="3106586">Several places in the record, there is discussion by members of the committee, the House particularly Mr. La Follette who is the member of Congress from Washington, that the purpose of the Federal Power Act was not to infringe on the rights of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.090" offset="3164264">But what was -- the situation was then at the time that this Act was passed was that under the statutes of 1899 -- I have and got them in the brief, its three statutes 1121, 33 U.S. Code Section 401.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.143" offset="3228526">There was a provision that no dam or structure could be built and crossing navigable stream without the consent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.431" offset="3261649">That was a limitation on the Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.798" offset="3275128">And as a result, there hadn't been -- I mean, anytime anyone wanted to build a dam, he would have to come to the Congress of the United States and obtain permission to put a structure across the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.026" offset="3332075">If he did not do so, there was always the risk that the capital that was invested in the operation would be lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.435" offset="3361646">And there was considerable confusion between the two Houses of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.406" offset="3389544">In one House, it was felt that there should be some contribution paid by the licensee for the use of the property and by the other that there'd be no contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.117" offset="3428415">And as a result, no dams were constructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.393" offset="3437505">There were only I think the record show that there were two dams constructed over a period of approximately 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.402" offset="3461538">And the Act by giving authority to a commission to license and release on behalf of the United States, the power to build dams did encourage construction of dams.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.355" offset="3525381">The limitation was not one at the time of the Act that had been placed there by the States but the question of the limitation on navigation of the federal power and to construe this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.042" offset="3576163">As counsel for petitioner have requested this Court to construe it would be a very severe limitation on the right of States which is not apparent in the Act itself and would imply to Congress that intent which normally would -- would seem to me should be spelled out with great certainty before the United States of America as a sovereign, as the Supreme Sovereign gets into a discussion with the Sovereign States as to the use of their governmental property.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.710" offset="3702805">For a while, the United States of America when it takes the property, it takes it in its governmental sphere, the licensees of the Federal Power Commission take either our States or municipalities taken a proprietary sphere.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.529" offset="3758080">And when a -- a private utility takes -- it takes, of course, on a private sphere and to infer that Congress intended to take for that purpose, governmental property seems to me to be beyond the plain implication of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1275.441" offset="5101714">Now, this Court has recognized that for federal purposes, the Carmack case typical of them, the property which has been dedicated to a public use may be taken.</text>

            <text syncTime="1318.171" offset="5272660">And there is a difference for the -- the higher use and necessity of the one over the other because Tacoma must exist first for its governmental purpose which is to handle on a local level, governmental powers of police and protection and -- and several government in -- for protection of the people.</text>

            <text syncTime="1820.962" offset="7283775">And that from my standpoint that is a state question, the City is going to operate under state law that the Government will not operate it and they -- they will -- the Government, in every other respect by state law, except this one thing, they want -- that we're coming to what they want to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.598" offset="7354305">Now, the Commission gave rather close, very close attention to the question of the fishery resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.384" offset="7413447">Remember the examiner had turned down and recommended against the license because of the paramount need of fishery resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.633" offset="7450436">The Commission determined that at this time there was a need for the City to develop power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.561" offset="7482201">And at the top of page 24 pointed out that it's not a question of -- as counsel has said, “A one or the other.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.916" offset="7531624">It's a question of both and you can have both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.619" offset="7562449">At the top of page 24, the Court points out, however, that the fish ladders and such things as were proposed to be installed were rather experimental and would take some development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.646" offset="7622531">And I'd like to read the sentence at the bottom of page 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.609" offset="7646354">And this occurs in the opinion which is made a part of the order specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.467" offset="7681776">It has been asserted that by the time a satisfactory evidence can be obtained as to the success of the fishery conservation facilities proposed by applicant, the fishery resources may well be reduced to insignificance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.092" offset="7760353">Being cognizant of this possibility, we propose that the hatchery facilities be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.162" offset="7796611">Here is what I wish to emphasize.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.154" offset="7808522">Soon enough to assure initially maintenance of a sizeable seed stock and later to complement the natural productivity above the dams.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.487" offset="7857946">Now, to be sure, who is going to do that, on the next page, the Commission says, “Studies of these problems should go forward promptly and we expect the City either to employ its own biologist or make suitable arrangements with the State of Washington for expert assistance in exploring all possible means of working out the details of this and other problems.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.424" offset="7973616">Your Honors, when the Commission said that as a language, it had in mind that a fish hatchery can't be interrupted at -- at any specific time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.225" offset="8044878">These anadromous fish who have gone to sea take two years to come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.496" offset="8069956">And they said that you must start this soon enough to ensure initially maintenance of a sizeable seed stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.208" offset="8112797">That is, a mass hatchery -- hatchery facilities must be provided, so two or three years in advance, so that there will be no serious deprivation of fishers in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.266" offset="8172983">The license was granted on that condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.129" offset="8192418">Now, if the Power Commission had authority to deal with whether or not there should be eminent domain they didn't do it because they here said, “You can't condemn damage and take that fish hatchery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.701" offset="8246753">You must substitute for it and replace it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.315" offset="8265247">They had in mind, that just as though they said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.304" offset="8285205">The state statutes called to Your -- Your Honor's attention on page 7 of our brief, that this hatchery would inundate state highways as well as the fish hatchery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.413" offset="8341629">And each of those necessary governmental operations especially in highways, it is spelled out how the City may get the right to flood those highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.016" offset="8391993">They do certain things, culminating in a new highway and then the statute abrogates or vacates rather the old one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.529" offset="8434103">And the economy of the State of Washington is not disrupted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.201" offset="8452702">You can't condemn without doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.790" offset="8467122">That our court said and on page 7 of the brief, I cite the case that such a method is exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.247" offset="8492931">In the case of the fish hatchery, you do the same when you have new hatcheries climbing up and it -- and likely should have put in -- in the -- by the dictate of the Power Commission and when they are then working.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.551" offset="8566178">The -- this fish commissions simply declares that its -- it is not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.567" offset="8590211">The land is sent to the Commissioner of Public Lands and he sells it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.879" offset="8619468">Thereof, I have a little difference with Mr. Lynch on the power of condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.432" offset="8645695">It is my opinion that private capital, public utility districts, the City or anyone else could build that dam if they followed that statutory method.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.058" offset="8700134">But now let us go ahead and see what the City of Tacoma did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.230" offset="8724898">This may be out of chronological order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.224" offset="8744856">This is out of chronological order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.009" offset="8751961">But later on in the litigation, on October 3rd, 1955, remember the license was given four years before in November 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.423" offset="8825626">The language I read to Your Honors was of the opinion of November 1951, page 207 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.498" offset="8861989">On October 3rd, 1955, Tacoma made an answer to the State's cross complaint in which we set up, which we asked for an injunction, the injunction before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.375" offset="8925414">They said in this answer, “In -- in respect thereto, Tacoma alleges the plaintiff has not yet entered into negotiations with said game commission relating to the alteration, adjustment, relocation or acquisition of such fish hatchery and that continued full use of such hatchery can be had through proper adjustments and partial relocations thereof without diminishing usefulness, thereof.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.122" offset="9048398">And I skip a line, “That plaintiff intends to and will acquire either through negotiation and purchase or eminent domain proceedings and stood in prosecutor in their proper tribunal, any and all necessary rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.409" offset="9125616">There Your Honors for the first time did we have proof that Tacoma was not going to replace that hatchery, hadn't being doing it and was attempting to condemn it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4238.841" offset="16955350">The remedies for enforcement of a license are -- rest in the hands of the United States, presumably the license will be enforced.</text>

            <text syncTime="4262.758" offset="17050958">Now, if the Commission -- Power Commission, it elsewhere, it reserves the authority to reexamine the question of the fish protection in the opinion accompanying the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.889" offset="17087530">As this investigation, this process of trying out these devices proceeds, the Commission may very well say, “We want further proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="4337.178" offset="17348650">In what court and under what terms it's not before this tribunal now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4343.603" offset="17374354">The Eleventh Amendment was referred to earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4346.004" offset="17383967">The -- the Court had that problem in -- in California versus Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.779" offset="17399014">And in the footnote said that problem isn't here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.383" offset="17409463">That's for another day.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.582" offset="17414269">In the later suit if whenever it becomes necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4357.430" offset="17429629">Now, as to being destructive of the hatchery, we would institute condemnation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.143" offset="17452513">We would in accord with the requirements of the Power Commission build such hatcheries at such time and such place as they tell us to and those were to be built in cooperation with the investigations of the State Game Commission, the Fisheries Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.010" offset="17504026">That it is not and never has been in this record any indication of a desire by the City of Tacoma to wantonly destroy the fishery resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="4385.449" offset="17541747">To the contrary, the Commission found that the values of the fish above may fill the reservoir were of the order of $600,000 per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4394.729" offset="17578841">This is costing the City of Tacoma, the Commission found -- it's in the record, $610,000 a year just to maintain and operate these facilities more than the entire resource being saved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4407.115" offset="17628369">It required us to build hatcheries, fish ladders, elevators, whatever that cost $9.5 million that are far easier to pay for.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.381" offset="17665463">Now, the -- the issue of fish versus power as Mr. John -- John Lynch indicated as long since it was raised up, disposed of by the Power Commission and by the Ninth Circuit and the court below refused to reopen and pass upon those, although invited by the State to revive the issue of the Fish Sanctuary Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4434.405" offset="17737561">We have solely the question here of whether the -- as the court below said, whether the federal power of eminent domain tested and we think in the licensee by Section 21 may be exercised to carry out a project which without the exercise of that power is blocked -- blocked by this resolution of the Power Commission absent action by the State to confer duplicate authority upon that licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.189" offset="17860754">And for the reasons I indicated earlier, we think the answer has to be in the affirmative or as was suggested by a question, the entire federal power program under the Federal Power Act in this area just ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.542" offset="17918119">It now seems to be conceded that no licensee could proceed under the Federal Power Act upon the Cowlitz River as long as this fishery hatchery remains there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4490.105" offset="17960333">In the earlier opinions, it wasn't so clear, the implications left, perhaps, a foreign corporation or a private power company could do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4497.738" offset="17990949">Now, under the decision in the Seaboard Air Line case versus Daniel, it's clear that Congress can supersede state laws, confer additional authority upon a corporation not conferred by the State that a state cannot keep such a corporation from entering and carrying out those federally conferred extra charter authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.153" offset="18080601">The same result had been reached in earlier case, the United -- the Texas versus United States where it was -- the state decree to the corporation was objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4528.657" offset="18114560">In the Chapman -- in U.S. ex rel. Chapman versus the Federal Power Commission, Your Honors have called attention to the fact that the functions of the Federal Power Commission under this Act are very much like the functions of the Interstate Commerce Commission under the Transportation Act of 1920 which was involved in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4550.388" offset="18201496">Others -- the question was asked earlier with respect to this res judicata matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.838" offset="18227304">I don't insist to recall its res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="4559.651" offset="18238589">It's a question of finality of -- of proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4562.877" offset="18251442">The statute provided an exclusive -- exclusive method of review, Section 313 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="4568.484" offset="18273907">That was exhausted more than four years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="4573.150" offset="18292506">This type of problem should have been presented to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4576.774" offset="18307030">Shall you put into the license order more conditions than you did, timing for putting in of the substitute hatchery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4584.817" offset="18339213">And if the Commission didn't agree, it should have been raised with the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.945" offset="18351752">None of that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.441" offset="18357708">Instead -- if I had time, I should read the allegations made in the Commission, made on the briefs that evoke entirely to the question of power, that the City of Tacoma cannot take these lands, beds and banks of the stream owned by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4605.950" offset="18423745">This is “riparian tract.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.834" offset="18431269">The hatchery is on “riparian land.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.666" offset="18438583">It is the banks with the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="4612.266" offset="18449032">The dominant federal navigation servitude extents were taught by the Twin City case and by the Oklahoma ex rel. Phillips versus Atkinson case to reservoir areas that are required for the carrying out of the -- of the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.802" offset="18511203">It is not limited to the -- to the lands that are -- that are wet by the stream in its natural state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.827" offset="18535236">This is a prime case where the federal preeminent power of eminent domain which is entitled to the same protection of the Supremacy Clause as is the Commerce Power itself when used in aid of the Commerce Power should be good in full effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4648.439" offset="18593750">Thank you, Your Honors.</text>
