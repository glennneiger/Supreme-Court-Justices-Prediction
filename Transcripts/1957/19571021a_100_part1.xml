            <label>Mr. John J. Abt</label>
            <text syncTime="26.497" offset="105953">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.452" offset="117760">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.765" offset="135001">This case presents for review, two judgments of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirming convictions of the petitioners for criminal contempt of an order of the District Court that was entered on July 2nd, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.055" offset="208144">The order in question requires the petitioners to surrender to the United States Marshal in consequence of the affirmance by this Court in Dennis versus the United States of their convictions for conspiring to violate the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.154" offset="280555">Each petitioner was separately tried by the Court without a jury and was sentenced to imprisonment in a penitentiary for a term of three years consecutive upon his five-year sentence in Dennis.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.819" offset="347220">The questions along the two cases are identical and there has no material difference between them as to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.926" offset="387657">The first point that I shall argue is that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.099" offset="416392">Each contempt proceeding was initiated by an affidavit of the United States Attorney and the issuance of an order to show cost followed by the filing of specifications of criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.005" offset="475951">These documents charge that the petitioners had and I quote, “Willfully and knowingly disobeyed the order for their surrender which is entered on July 2, 1951” and which, and again I quote, “they well knew to the outstanding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="138.081" offset="552229">Accordingly, knowledge by the petitioners of the existence of the order was an essential element of the offense and one which the Government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.469" offset="613773">The Government, however, introduced no evidence whatsoever that the petitioners knew that the order for their surrender had been issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.769" offset="651076">The Government's evidence, petitioners offered none established appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.078" offset="680229">The Dennis' defendants were convicted and sentenced in the 1949 after which they were enlarged on bail and pending appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.806" offset="715128">This Court affirmed their conviction on June 4th, 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.716" offset="746789">Thereafter, on June 28th, 1951, the United States Attorney served defense counsel with a notice that on July 2nd, he would make application to District Judge Ryan for an order requiring all of the defendants to surrender through the Marshal on July 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.447" offset="833724">The next day, June 29th, counsel for both sides appeared before Judge Ryan in connection with certain motion that the defense desired to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.631" offset="878446">Believing that he had no jurisdiction in the case because the mandate of this Court had not yet been received by the District Court, Judge Ryan deferred consideration of all matters until July 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.470" offset="937796">At that point, one of the defense attorneys gave the Court the assurance that he would have all the defendants in Court on July 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.344" offset="973322">Later, the same day, that is after the appearance before Judge Ryan.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.380" offset="993489">Two of the defense attorneys saw their clients including the petitioner advised them of their presence in Court on July 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.383" offset="1021492">It was required and were assured that the petitioners would be present on that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.208" offset="1052735">Petitioners and two of the other Dennis' defendants all -- and Thompson, did not appear on July 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.385" offset="1081469">At which time, Judge Ryan declared their bail forfeited and issued bench warrants for their arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.182" offset="1112712">He also signed the proposed order requiring the immediate surrender of all of the Dennis' defendants including the four fugitives.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.943" offset="1155762">Now, I shall point out in greater detail later that as the Government, I think, concedes, this appears to be the only instance in the entire history of Anglo-American law of the entry of an order for the appearance or surrender of a defendant after the defendant had absconded.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.164" offset="1248653">In any event, petitioners were not seen or heard from again until the time of their voluntary surrender, Green on February 27th and Winston on March 5th, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.481" offset="1313855">Each petitioner announced his intention to surrender in a statement that he mailed to the press the day before his appearance in the court house.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.973" offset="1355860">The substance of this statement was that petitioners had fled in 1951 as a means of resisting what they believe to be a (Inaudible) in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.263" offset="1409045">And that their surrender was motivated by what they regarded as a change in the political climate which made this form of resistance unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.334" offset="1453244">Green made similar statements upon interviews by the press at his appearance -- at the time of his appearance at the court house.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.872" offset="1487412">Now, these statements, of course, acknowledge the obvious that both petitioners had pled to obey the imprisonment and so much counsel conceded at the trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.804" offset="1539135">However, there's nothing in their statements to indicate that they have knowledge of the issuance of a surrender order of July 2nd and under that order which they were charged with willfully unknowingly disobeying well knowing and without standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.628" offset="1610501">I have now recited all of the evidence in the case and what I've said is not only my version to the fact, but the fact as found by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.891" offset="1659507">His appearance from his written opinion on the Green case, record 67, a relevant paragraph as quoted of my -- in my brief at page 12 and I invite the Court's attention to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.940" offset="1723664">The trial court found that this evidence which I have now summarized was sufficient to establish beyond the reasonable doubt that petitioners knowingly disobeyed the order for their surrender.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.128" offset="1776431">But I submit that the evidence offers no support for that conclusion.</text>
