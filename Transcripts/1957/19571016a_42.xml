            <text syncTime="6.256" offset="24973">Mr. Solicitor General, you may continue.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel J. Torina</label>
            <text syncTime="9.490" offset="37930">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.041" offset="56111">Yesterday, when the adjournment is called up, I was discussing the question of procedure in Michigan involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.639" offset="90488">I think I'll continue on because I think that the proceedings that were involved in this case are very important to its determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.672" offset="126642">Now, I would like to profess my argument by pointing out that these proceedings have been before this Court prior to this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.311" offset="157153">They were considered in the Quicksall versus Michigan case which Mr. Justice Frankfurter wrote the opinion on and approved or I would like to review them again.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.834" offset="203233">Now, Willie B. Moore was arraigned on information.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.031" offset="220056">It wasn't a complicated information.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.647" offset="230504">It was count in simple language that run in substance as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.093" offset="248372">Now, Willie B. Moore heretofore to wit on or about the 26th day of October 1938 at the City of Kalamazoo in the County of Kalamazoo aforesaid murdered Josie Zeedyke.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.607" offset="310335">And then after that the Court -- the Court reporter's transcript shows that the accused was arraigned and pleaded guilty in the official general entry which appears here.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.978" offset="355892">Now, this arraignment was on the 29th day of October in 1938, and the general entry under our law raised the strong presumptions and it discloses that following the plea -- but before imposing sentence, the trial judge took two important procedural steps in accordance with our state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.096" offset="440320">Now, I think I mentioned yesterday that at the time this case was tried, Rule 35-A didn't exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.996" offset="475951">We did have a statute which still exist, which provided that on the plea of guilty, the judge was to discover from the witness whether he pleaded guilty voluntarily or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.684" offset="526733">There wasn't any procedure outlined by which that discovery was to be made and several has been used throughout the state and approved by our court.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.378" offset="577411">On this case, according to a witness, the colloquy took place between Willie B. Moore and the judge for about 15 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.318" offset="609176">This witness was running sure who was an attorney spectator in the court at the time this arraignment took place, He said it was about 9 o'clock in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.776" offset="647001">Well anyhow, after this colloquy, the judge took Willie Moore into his chambers and Willie Moore says that at the time he was accompanied by Sheriff Rubel (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="174.466" offset="697783">However, Rubel (ph) denied that he went into the chambers with the judge and the judge then, according to this record, which has been put on file, he made a statement of the proceedings first.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.435" offset="749714">Now he put on file.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.066" offset="756193">He discussed with Willie B. Moore his -- his education, his background and then he says Willie Moore gave him all the details of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.259" offset="792973">And when he came out, he put that on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.254" offset="804989">Had the description of the crime as given by Willie Moore and then he ended up with this statement that appears on page 15 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.092" offset="848353">“In my private interview with respondent, I assured him that he must not plead guilty unless he really is guilty, that he was not required to plead guilty, that he could have a trial by jury if he desired it.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.039" offset="912091">He assured me freely and voluntarily that he is guilty and that his one desire is to have it all over to get to the institution to which he is committed and to be under observation and to be examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.604" offset="962351">Now, that was put on the day of the arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.007" offset="971964">That was put on record and appeared in the official Court records.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.910" offset="991608">That was the statement he made.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.812" offset="999236">Following that, the judge then took a second statutory statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.230" offset="1016895">Our statute still requires that upon a plea of guilty in the case of murder, the judge has to put witnesses on the stand to determine the degree of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.281" offset="1057123">If that isn't done, our Court has -- and that hasn't been done in a couple of case and each time our Court has avoided this -- the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.431" offset="1089724">Well, the judge then had I think three -- three witnesses were put on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.303" offset="1121176">One was the daughter of the deceased or the -- of the murdered woman, (Inaudible) Zeedyke and she testified that she saw Willie Moore come to the house on the day he asked her if they had any work to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.754" offset="1170913">She knew him.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.313" offset="1173211">She had met him previously to this time because Willie Moore had worked for her brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.020" offset="1192020">And after that, she said she saw him (Inaudible) she found her mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.203" offset="1208738">Another witness was a policeman who is called to the scene of the murder and he testified as to the condition of the woman and then the coroner testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.085" offset="1252310">The coroner or the doctor as to the condition of the woman, what caused her death and so on and while I think of -- there was a police.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.558" offset="1282194">I -- I don't recall exactly.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.096" offset="1288359">It's in the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.081" offset="1292225">There are three or four witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="700.434" offset="2801685">He's colored and he has handled a great number of these cases and I'd like to say here now that I'm surprised that when they first filed this delayed motion for a new trial, there was nothing said about duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.917" offset="2851631">The only thing they went upon was the De Meerleer case which he mentioned here yesterday and that was grounded on the failure to appoint counsel, failure to inform him on the consequences of his plea and -- and the fact that he was rushed into a hearing without experience and it was frankly verbatim De Meerleer But after they had the hearing under the delayed motion for a new trial which followed this hearing, part of it, then they Sheriff Struble made a remark about the tension on that that time and then he brought that in and I'd like to refer the Court to where that happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.410" offset="2993633">On page 9, the grounds of the delayed motion for a new trial are sent out in my brief and they're verbatim from De Meerleer.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.081" offset="3024248">And then, on -- on page 23 at the delay hearing on the delayed motion for a new trial, after Sheriff Struble testified, Willie Moore testified, Mr. Roxboro advised the Court as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.970" offset="3099794">No, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.698" offset="3102720">Before he -- before the proceeding started, and Mr. Roxboro informed the court as follows.</text>

            <text syncTime="788.421" offset="3153607">We are relying on just two things, on this record and on the De Meerleer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.362" offset="3177430">I would like to call the court's attention that at the time Willie B. Moore -- and at that time, Willie B. Moore was 17 years of age.”</text>

            <text syncTime="803.161" offset="3212643">The extent of his education then was at seventh-grade education and it is our contention that he did not have a fair trial and that contention is substantiated by the case of De Meerleer versus the People on the State of Michigan and then he quoted -- cites it then.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.069" offset="3276173">It is our contention that this case is directly in point and fits on all four the case before the bar at that time and then the assistant prosecutor who was conducting the examination said, so there won't be any mistakes, I want this to be down if that's what they're going on, but then after Rubel (ph) testified and Willie Moore testified, they asked to amend the motion for a new trial to include duress and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.716" offset="3382857">The -- and the court allowed them and continued the hearing and they brought in more witnesses and the people brought in more witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.727" offset="3418906">Now, there was something said here about the promise of leniency made by Mr. Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.904" offset="3439595">The record shows that Willie Moore said that Mr. (Inaudible), the prosecutor promised him leniency and that this was okayed by Chapman.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.044" offset="3484108">Now, we -- the people weren't able to refute that for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.384" offset="3505528">First of all, Mr. (Inaudible) is paralytic now.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.475" offset="3517858">He can't speak and the record shows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.322" offset="3533218">He's an old man and he's just -- and that -- and that he's suffering from incapacity and Chapman is in Florida and he weren't -- they weren't able to get him and that's why that wasn't refuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.010" offset="3580029">But anyhow, after that happened, the judge heard all the witnesses, both pro and con and the -- all the testimony regarding the fact that there was duress and so on, appeared to Willie Moore.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.161" offset="3632588">The only other testimony regarding the tension in the community came from Sheriff Struble who said that the -- there was a lot of tension at that time and he told them that he pleaded guilty if he were guilty ought to plead guilty, but he said also that he told him that if he weren't guilty, he'd stand firm and protect you.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.427" offset="3709701">That's what he said and that's what they're relying on chiefly in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.974" offset="3723807">There are other witnesses who took the stand afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.057" offset="3732167">Who said screw Hummel and two or three other officers took the stand and said there wasn't any tension in the community, it was a usual thing when you got a murder of this kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="1021.002" offset="4083984">Now, that wall surrounds -- the fifth floor is sort of a penthouse and the jail itself is back from the edge of the building, about four feet and then there are windows for look out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.493" offset="4133930">But in further, those windows appeared in this cement wall which goes six or seven feet up above the jail and the jail itself is about 60 feet to 75 feet high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.615" offset="4174367">Now, the only entrance to these cells are first, the elevator, which has been described and that's used only for prisoners and it's a very small elevator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.270" offset="4204983">I think it's about twice as wide as this stand and it has a lock in the basement and it's unlocked when prisoners are taken into jail by the sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.282" offset="4245107">Then, it doesn't stop the first floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.816" offset="4251167">It stops at the second floor where the court is and it stops at the fifth floor where the jail is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.677" offset="4270707">I don't think he can get over five or six people in that -- in that elevator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.254" offset="4284918">And then, there's a stairway to right of there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.430" offset="4293695">It's a very narrow stairway and the door leads into the outer room in the jail where the prisoners are booked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.719" offset="4326818">It's a very narrow stairway as I'd say and the door is made up of cement -- of steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.497" offset="4345940">And then, there's another stairway that goes into the part where the judge lived at that time.As the record says, the judge had an apartment in the jail himself and that was up towards the front.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.982" offset="4383869">Now, that door has a very -- that stairway is also narrow and it has a steel door and it only opens from the inside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.090" offset="4412291">It can't be open from the outside and then there's another iron door that blocks off any entrance into the -- the main room here, so you can see the situation at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.906" offset="4451579">I don't believe Willie Moore, when he says there were people there, they couldn't because there's an outer office, it's a very small one and then there's another steel door that leads into where the cell is which is on the right and that -- and left to that is the kitchen and they had a very cook there and I thought it was a very pleasant (Inaudible) better than some hotel I've been in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1170.386" offset="4681456">And everything that Willie Moore contended here came out of the hearing that day and he's complaining about that hearing now in saying, “We can't use that reconstructing testimony,” but I don't think that's fair.</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Culver</label>
            <text syncTime="1287.561" offset="5150198">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.405" offset="5153541">First of all, I would like to indicate to the Court that clearly the issue of duress and the arrest and coercion is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.365" offset="5197427">The record shows that the Court granted a motion of attorney Roxboro to bring that into the case and that secondly, I wish to point out to the Court that although at one time, this was based on the De Meerleer case in the initial part of the proceeding that subsequently after Mr. Roxboro heard the testimony and after he got into -- into the proceeding that it was extended and we would ask as I've indicated when we started out, the attempt is to put this into a category with, we'll say De Meerleer and Quicksall or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.507" offset="5333995">This case is the case as they all are seems to me onto themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.335" offset="5353326">And then finally, I would like to answer Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question which I think he recently asked and which I think raises the distinct problem here and that is, how do you get around the fact that the trial judge, Judge Weimer said, “I'm satisfied that this is freely and voluntary made”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.830" offset="5419259">And I -- I submit the answer to that is that no one, not even Mr. Moore's lawyers knew until 1951 of the fact that Sheriff Struble had been afraid and had warned Mr. Moore that if he -- if that -- he was afraid that he couldn't protect you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.847" offset="5507344">And therefore, that even though the statement by Judge Weimer was contemporaneous with the -- with the sentence that I submit that Judge Weimer himself didn't know what we know right now and that was that the sheriff has told his men that he couldn't protect him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.151" offset="5568575">Now, he knew all the rest of the things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.612" offset="5574426">He knew about the youth and inexperienced Mr. Moore but he didn't know the facts that we know now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.861" offset="5599399">And therefore, I submit to you that we -- we wish to depend upon this delayed -- this right of a delayed motion and the right to this testimony in the record because it does show something that is going -- that's why we'll show up again before this Court and that is that the sentencing judge on a plea of guilty may not know all of the circumstances and it can only be dug out by an attorney and by cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.860" offset="5695425">And another thing I'd like to point out is that after Mr. Struble, the sheriff was put on in testifying in this case that the prosecution then spend a day and a half trying to -- to prejudice trying to show that Mr. Sheriff Struble was wrong and of course you've got the pictures of the jail and everything that shows that this man couldn't possibly has been subject to duress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.191" offset="5796676">But you'll notice that nobody -- that -- that he wasn't in that jail all the time that he was only there one night according to Sheriff Struble and nobody agrees about that and I submit that it's outside the record, but the man was kept in the police headquarters in a jail in the basement or if you want to get down there, you just walk down the stairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.692" offset="5866684">You don't have to go pass an officer at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.224" offset="5876820">So, I submit to the Court again that the issue of duress and coercion is before the Court and it's in the -- in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.683" offset="5910674">And secondly, that he didn't -- we don't pretend that this is the De Meerleer case.We think it looks a little like the De Meerleer case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.671" offset="5942648">It looks a little like the Quicksall case, but that's -- that the -- our only hope of success, I submitted the fact that this Court is the last word and that this will be a People versus Moore case which you don't try that to correlate and say, “Well, it doesn't fit in any case that's been before the Court exactly.”</text>
