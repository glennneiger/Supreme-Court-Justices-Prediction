            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="86.724" offset="346802">Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.881" offset="359445">This case comes before the Court on direct appeal from the dismissal of a criminal information, charging an alien seaman with remaining in the United States for a period in excess of the number of days permitted by his landing permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.117" offset="448366">The District Court dismissed the information on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction because the suit was commenced it thought in the long -- in the wrong district.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.879" offset="511478">The appellee was an alien crewman from a ship which put in at Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.757" offset="542929">He was given a landing permit which allowed him to remain in the United States for the period the ship was in Philadelphia of not more than 29 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.954" offset="607713">Instead of sailing with the ship, he went on to New York, where he stayed for about a year and then he went to Connecticut, where he was residing at the time he was apprehending -- apprehended and this proceeding was commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.346" offset="665287">This proceeding was commenced in Connecticut, where he was residing when he was apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.574" offset="698201">The District Judge held that if -- if this man had committed an offense, it was completed when the ship sails and that it was a single offense, which was done at that time and therefore, he was not in violation of the law while he was residing in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.647" offset="790570">And for this reason, it dismissed the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.671" offset="802586">The Government brings the case here under the Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.801" offset="827141">Section 3237 of the Criminal Code provides that any offense committed in more than one district may be inquired off and prosecuted in any district in which the offense was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.267" offset="897045">And so the simple question here is whether the offense with which this appellee was charged was a continuing offense, which was in the process of being committed when he lived in Connecticut, whether it was a non-continuing offense which was completed when the ship sailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.365" offset="1009371">First, I think we should look at the definition of the offense as it contained -- as it is contained in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.161" offset="1040614">That is printed at page 33 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.725" offset="1050854">It reads, “Any alien seaman -- any alien crewman who wilfully remains in the United States in excess of the number of days allowed in any conditional permit issued under subsection (a) of this Section, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="282.148" offset="1128490">The important words from our point of view were, “any alien crewman who willfully remains in the United States in excess of the number of days allowed”.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.527" offset="1182093">On the facts of this particular case, there are three geographic localities where it is possible that someone might claim that there was venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.686" offset="1230681">First is Philadelphia, the city where the vessel put in and from which it sailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.686" offset="1266730">It would really make little sense to require trial to be held in Philadelphia because the seaman is not in fact required to sail from Philadelphia by the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.610" offset="1322423">As long as he -- the law reads, for the period permitted by the -- by the permit, as long as he leaves the United States within that period of time, whether he leaves from Philadelphia or somewhere else, he is not in violation of the law</text>
            <text syncTime="345.586" offset="1382296">.In fact, many landing permits contemplate that the seaman will leave from another port on another vessel and many of the landing permits therefore would have nothing to do with the original -- the original port of entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.522" offset="1446034">Now, the second locality, where venue might be asserted is the place where the crewman was physically at the time the permit expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.675" offset="1498697">This of course depends in part on chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.906" offset="1515624">He might in fact be in -- in transit from one place to another at the time -- the moment the permit expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.704" offset="1542792">And if the permit were -- the length of the permit were measured by the time that the vessel remained in port, he might not even know of this precise time that the vessel departed and therefore, he would not know at what time he was actually violating the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.516" offset="1614054">Now, the third possible place to pick the venue is the place or the places where the -- where the alien crewman resides -- remains after the period of time which it permitted by his landing permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.621" offset="1702452">We believe that establishing venue in this place coincides with the language of the statute, that it coincides with the nature of the crime which is involved and that imposes no hardship on the -- on the alien involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="464.717" offset="1858769">Well, it's -- I think it's domicile, but I think also he would be remaining in New York if he worked there.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.068" offset="1880189">I don't mean to use residence in any two technical term.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.956" offset="1891788">I mean, he must willfully be staying in a place and rather than merely passing through it.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.420" offset="1925642">I say this -- this is inconsistent with the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.312" offset="1941211">The language of the statute as I pointed out a minute ago is that he willfully remains in the United States in excess of the number of days allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.732" offset="1978828">It does not say that the alien must leave at or before the termination of his -- of his permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.698" offset="2006727">It uses the word remain and that word in itself has a -- has a sense of continuation.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.807" offset="2039223">It can be defined as, if he continued to stay in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.211" offset="2060748">And that is why I say that on the language, just purely on the language of the statute, this man was remaining in the United States at the time he was apprehended in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.949" offset="2107768">Now, as to the nature of the offense, here, there is no objection to the alien's entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.226" offset="2144862">There was nothing illegal about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.189" offset="2152699">He has committed no crime outside of remaining since he has come to this country, forfeiting his right to stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.324" offset="2189270">We have -- there is no discovery of any disloyalty, no association of his past, which makes him ineligible to remain in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.420" offset="2217587">Instead, the only -- the only thing that Congress was -- was getting at in this case was an alien who stayed, who remained in the country longer than he was permitted to, remained by the -- by the immigration law.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.273" offset="2281012">This law was passed by Congress after an investigation, in which it was determined that every year, thousands of alien seamen were attempting to loose themselves in the population of the United States and obtain a right to stay here by -- not a right to stay here but obtaining the actual staying here by losing themselves in the -- in the general population.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.965" offset="2379860">Congress wasn't concerned really with a man who overstayed his leave by days, hours, or minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.064" offset="2412251">It was concerned with seamen who were using their entry into the United States as seamen as a method of acquiring illegal residence here and therefore, I say that the very nature of the crime, which Congress was attacking was that very thing which this appellee was doing in Connecticut at the time he was apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.185" offset="2512666">Now, since the constitutional provisions on -- on venue, without a doubt intended to protect defendants from the hardships of being tried in places where they are not properly able to defend themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.308" offset="2589153">It -- it is appropriate that in considering the construction of this statute, we should consider it in the light of the constitutional provisions that say a man shall be tried in the -- in the district where the crime takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.550" offset="2646100">And we should consider whether or not the construction, which I suggest is one which will constitute the kind of hardship which the Constitution was attempting to -- to eliminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.260" offset="2693016">Well, in this case, as I say, there were three places where he could be tried and this case might be taken as more or less characteristic of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.096" offset="2724362">He could have been tried in Philadelphia of -- that's one possibility as to where a venue could be asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.001" offset="2755918">That certainly would not be a place which would be -- which we have any reason to believe -- to believe would be convenient to the seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.028" offset="2784026">So far as we would know, he hasn't been in -- in Philadelphia since the day he landed in -- in the -- in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.577" offset="2814224">And similarly with New York, he stayed in New York and presumably, may well have been there at the time when -- when the ship sailed, when his permit expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.352" offset="2853407">But so far as we know, he has no connections there and it would have been -- it would be equally difficult for him to defend himself in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.235" offset="2884859">On the other hand, Connecticut is the place of his residence and it is therefore more consistent with the -- with the constitutional provisions that he should be tried in -- in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.270" offset="2933029">The disadvantage which the -- which the alien suffers from our construction is that if it is a continuing crime, it may be that he could be tried in more than one district.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.196" offset="2996767">And therefore, we are faced with the question whether he would suffer a hardship because the Department of Justice would be in a position to pick and choose among the various districts to determine which -- in which district to bring suit against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.957" offset="3059775">And with -- in regard to this -- this matter, I may say that the present criminal code -- code of criminal procedure gives him protection because when there is a crime which takes place in more than one district, the Department of Justice no longer has the -- has the right to choose the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.667" offset="3138664">The judge -- the District Court in which the case is brought, has discretion to remove the case to any other district where the crime -- where the crime equally occurred in order that justice may be done and therefore, the matter is left in the discretion of the -- of the Court itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="884.493" offset="3537920">Under the -- under the Immigration Act for example, with respect to illegal entry, there is a special provision saying that when an alien is apprehended, he may be tried in the place of apprehension rather than going back to the place of entry.</text>

            <text syncTime="975.600" offset="3902380">There are many continuing offenses where the statute of limitations, of course, does not run as long as the illegal activity is continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.115" offset="3940415">Conspiracy of course is -- is an example, which this Court has recorded all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.830" offset="3963298">Failure to register under the -- under the Alien Registration Act is another case.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.269" offset="3981061">Failure -- failure to register under the Selective Service Act is another case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.497" offset="4001959">And so, that there is a general theory of law that one doesn't get a right to violate the law by violating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.380" offset="4045427">There is no prescription runs and as long as he continues to -- to violate the statute will not run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.265" offset="4081058">That question is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.804" offset="4091193">And I merely suggest that it doesn't follow necessarily from the argument which I am making here on venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.464" offset="4121809">Now, the court below found some support for its position that this was a non-continuing crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.845" offset="4159321">On the -- on another provision of the statute dealing with entry and reentry after -- after an alien had been deported, there is a specific provision, Section 1329 of the -- of the Immigration Act, which says, “That in those cases of illegal entry and reentry, the alien maybe prosecuted at the place where he is apprehended.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.763" offset="4278962">And the Court said, Congress has dealt specifically with these problems and made the provision and put venue in them and by leaving out a provision with respect to overstaying the leave, it must have intended a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.706" offset="4342805">I submit the difference in treatment by Congress is not dependent upon an intent to have a different result, rather, it is dependent upon the fact that the crimes of illegal entry and reentry are by nature specific terminable acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.697" offset="4406753">And that if Congress had intended them -- intended to give a right to the Government to prosecute it, where the alien was apprehended, it was necessary to make this specific provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.513" offset="4457953">And in fact that by making this provision, it probably supports our position because it would be illogical to permit aliens who have been entered illegally or reentered illegally to be prosecuted where they're apprehended and not to permit a seaman in the situation which we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.071" offset="4548232">Therefore in summary, I -- I suggest that this -- this offense both by its nature, by definition in the statute, and by its consideration and inconsideration of the rights of the alien involved, may well should be held to be a continuing offense and that venues should be placed in Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.323" offset="4633287">I will reserve, if I may, the rest of the time for rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Clark M. Clifford</label>
            <text syncTime="1169.482" offset="4677904">May it please, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.015" offset="4700056">There is involved in this case an important question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.091" offset="4720327">The determination of which will not only dispose of this controversy but will be of substantial value to the courts below in finding a uniformity of approach to this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.318" offset="4773198">However, there is a more important consideration than that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.715" offset="4794828">For it appears to us that under the Government's theory, they would deprive this defendant and other similarly situated of a basic important right that he is given by the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.515" offset="4858044">I believe that my presentation would be most effective and I would trust most helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.873" offset="4887406">If I were to point out the two basic considerations upon which the court below reached his decision, then I shall refer to the Government's efforts to circumvent that reason, so that we might analyze the Government's position and see if there is merit in their contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.890" offset="4983536">We start with the basic principle that this defendant, Romualdo Cores, must be tried in the district in which the offense was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.072" offset="5040274">One becomes impressed with the importance that our law attaches to that consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.247" offset="5072980">It appears first, as Your Honors are aware, in Article III of the Constitution, reiterated in substance in the Sixth Amendment where it said that the man shall be tried in the state in the district in which the offense is perpetrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.651" offset="5138599">It goes on then and that constitutional theory is carried into our statutory law under Rule 18 of Criminal Procedure which says substantially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.949" offset="5179768">Then in the jurisdictional section of the statutes on immigration appears Section 1329 and there it is reiterated again the jurisdiction of the District Courts shall be found in this Section and offenses are to be tried where such offenses took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.894" offset="5291572">Now that's premise number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.303" offset="5301185">Now the court below, I must say we're entire agreement with them, found that the offense in this instance was committed at the time that Romualdo Cores' permit expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.101" offset="5368372">This man was here, we'll assume, on a 29-day permit under the immigration law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.590" offset="5394286">He was an alien crewman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.458" offset="5405780">That permit expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.070" offset="5416229">Now, it seems clear to us that the offense that took place in this case was the affirmative act of Romualdo Cores in staying in this country after his permit expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.786" offset="5491043">It took no other act on his part or on the part of any other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.412" offset="5513613">It's when he decided to violate the law and stay in this country, and his permit expired, that is the act which we contend constituted the criminal act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1673.794" offset="6695079">First, they say that the offense of remaining is a continuous offense and then they say also that the offense comes under that statute that provides for an offense that starts in one district and goes into another or occurs in more than one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.534" offset="6762057">Let's take them up one at a time, (a), that the offense of remaining is a continuous crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.517" offset="6790060">Now, the answer to that suggestion on the part of the Government is that criminal violations of Immigration Acts have never been regarded as continuing crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.975" offset="6835827">Now, our brief enumerates a number of cases of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.543" offset="6854113">A man comes in at a port illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.320" offset="6865189">He's guilty of illegal entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.876" offset="6875429">He then leaves that port and goes to one other place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.778" offset="6887027">There's an interesting case where a party comes in at New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.021" offset="6899984">He is later apprehended in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.679" offset="6914612">Now, he entered illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.636" offset="6922449">He has continued to remain illegally in the country all during those weeks and months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.173" offset="6948676">He is apprehended in California and tried there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.306" offset="6965185">The Court said the California Court District did not have jurisdiction, that the crime was committed back where he entered in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.868" offset="7007399">The immigration cases annotated are replete with that type of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.165" offset="7036656">There has been a definite theory of law growing up in cases similar to this that a man who enters illegally and who continues illegally in this country is not guilty of a continuing crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1825.408" offset="7301538">Now, Romualdo is here illegally because his permit expired the day before when the crime was committed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1834.813" offset="7339154">Now, Antonio, his friend, sitting with him on Monday is here illegally because he entered yesterday, Sunday, illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.952" offset="7379801">We don't see the distinction between those two individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.393" offset="7401535">The first man was guilty of a crime by remaining here illegally and he started the crime, as Justice Frankfurter suggested, at the -- at the time of that affirmative act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1908.869" offset="7635383">Now, on this question of continuing, I just like to leave it with this one further thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.332" offset="7665267">We consider the basic elementary principle that ordinarily when a man is charged with an offense, it is an affirmative act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.417" offset="7701629">Now, if the Congress is going to intend that a crime be a continuing act we say they can say so, they can tell the bar, they can tell this Court if they so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.298" offset="7753143">Now, they have in some instances because in the section that's been referred to and will be referred to later that is Section 3237, that Section that covers offenses that have taken place in different districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.904" offset="7811553">In the second paragraph of that Section, the Congress has said, “Any offense involving the use of the mails or transportation in interstate or foreign commerce is a continuing offense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.486" offset="7869858">And how simple it would have been in this instance had Congress intended this to be a continuing offense for the Congress, too, have said, “In this crime of remaining, any alien crewmen who willfully remains in the United States in excess of the number of days allowed is guilty of a continuing offense and shall be guilty of misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.426" offset="7965675">It was so easy for them to say the fact that they did not, that they refused to say it, although the discussions came up indicates very clearly to us that they did not -- that intend that it be a continuing offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2062.428" offset="8249678">Next point, the Government attempts very different -- very strenuously to bring this offense in under Section 3237.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.280" offset="8301087">That is the section that we've mentioned about that refers to a crime that starts in one district and goes into another district, or a crime that is committed in more than one district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.592" offset="8350302">We -- we say that this does not -- this type of offense does not come under that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.675" offset="8370678">It does not begin in one district and it isn't completed in another district.</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.310" offset="8409234">We say it's the affirmative act of this man staying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.977" offset="8423863">At the expiration of his permit, the offense was complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.329" offset="8445283">It takes no other act by him or by anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.156" offset="8464614">Now, under this Section 3237 are annotated many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.961" offset="8487811">We've gone through those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.389" offset="8493453">They're the type of case that you would expect, they're conspiracy cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.929" offset="8511634">They are cases that involved using the mails to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.710" offset="8534831">There are ordinarily a number of persons involved in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.237" offset="8548937">There is a very good analysis and a very good statement of what this Section means and the type of case it refers to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.600" offset="8598361">It appears in the memorandum that the court below wrote in a similar case called the Tavares case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.946" offset="8631693">And in construing this Section and in holding below that this Section did not cover this type of offense, the simple offense of remaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.517" offset="8670041">The court below said, where a crime consists of distinct parts, which have different localities or where it may be said there is a continuously moving act, commencing with the offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.363" offset="8721450">And hence, ultimately consummated through him or where there's a confederation in purpose between two or more persons, that's the type of offense that the Congress had in mind in passing Section 3237.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.409" offset="8785607">We submit that it -- this does not come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.283" offset="8797100">Now, getting to the point that Justice Douglas raised, Congress in the Immigration Act provides this jurisdictional section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.785" offset="8847047">Now, they say that there are two offenses, which can be tried in the district where the defendant is apprehended but only those two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.685" offset="8942655">The section says, “These defendants shall be tried where the offense is committed with the exception, however, that where a man illegally enters he may be tried wherever he is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.283" offset="9009110">Exception number two, if a man has been deported and reenters, he may be tried wherever he can be found or apprehended.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.341" offset="9057280">Those are the only two exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.055" offset="9068147">Now, the Congress had the right at the time when enumerating this jurisdictional section to say, “Yes, we'll include the crime of illegal entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.072" offset="9112242">We'll include the crime of entry after deportation and we will include the crime of Section 1282, which is the crime of remaining over permit time.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.126" offset="9164487">They did not do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.954" offset="9171801">They specifically refrained from doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.189" offset="9184653">And yet, it is the desire of the Government in this case that this Court write that in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.408" offset="9217567">There is a very apt and appropriate quote from a case, United States versus Johnson, in which are very similar question came up in 323 U.S., it had to do with enforcement of the Federal Denture Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.608" offset="9290397">And in that case, Justice Frankfurter, in speaking for the Court said, “In view of the keen awareness of enforcing officials as well as that of the members of the Committee on Interstate Commerce of the problems raised by venue in criminal trials, it is inadmissible to suggest either oversight on the part of Congress in failing to make provision for choice of venue or to make the cavalier assumption that that which is specifically provided for in other enactments, that is trial in more than one district, was authorized but through parsimony of language left unexpressed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.004" offset="9451938">Now, we say that in this instance, the Congress had a right to include this Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.322" offset="9481195">Speaking of parsimony of language, they needed no language at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.761" offset="9494988">They needed merely the figures 1282, that's all the Congress had to do, was add this Section to the two exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.712" offset="9534798">So it seems to us that the Government is asking this Court to write into the law an exception which the Congress itself chose not to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.733" offset="9582864">Counsel makes the suggestion that in this type of case where a man has remained over his permit, that he perhaps should be tried where he resides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.889" offset="9631556">Now, that's an interesting twist to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.030" offset="9640020">I'll give it just two minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.384" offset="9649528">And -- and they state that in the beginning on page 6 of the Government brief, they say, “So that an alien maybe prosecuted for such offense wherever he is living at the time prosecution is brought.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.640" offset="9714521">Then again on 12 they reiterated a little more strongly where they say “The venue for a prosecution of an alien crewman for the misdemeanor of willfully remaining, lies in any judicial district where he is found residing after expiration of his permit.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.406" offset="9789544">They say it again on page 18, so apparently, that's the theory with which they started out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.381" offset="9813473">On 18, the offense occurs wherever the alien deliberately resides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.792" offset="9835102">After a little while, I submit, the -- the cat gets out of the bag because on page 28 of the Government brief we find -- I don't believe that's what the Government really means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.746" offset="9890900">Because on page 28 they say, the end of the first paragraph on 28, “It would have been redundant to insert a light clause in regard to the crime of remaining because as an inherently continuing act, it would normally occur where the alien was apprehended.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.067" offset="9984209">That's what apparently they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.929" offset="9991628">They want the venue, they want the jurisdiction to lie where he was apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.214" offset="10012839">And again, their concluding sentence shows what the ultimate underlying motive is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.931" offset="10039693">We submit that every relevant indication of congressional intent indicates that Congress meant secretary -- Section 1282 (c) to describe a continuing offense and that venue should therefore lie wherever that offense continues to be committed, that is wherever the alien is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.121" offset="10124434">Now, we submit that it finally comes out, what they want to do is try this man, Cores, and other similarly situated where apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.565" offset="10170201">Now, that's exactly what those two exceptions are to the general jurisdiction, where apprehended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.933" offset="10207713">That is the man who comes in illegally, the man who comes in after being deported, they can be tried where apprehended, but they now want to try this fellow where apprehended, although the Congress chose not to make any such exception in this crime of remaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.590" offset="10282318">Now, someone might ask, when the crime of remaining could have been so simply made a continuing offense, all Congress had to do as we mentioned previously, was where they said that the crime of remaining is a misdemeanor, they could have said, “And shall be a continuing offense”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.145" offset="10384509">When they so easily could have done it, why did not Congress make this crime of remaining a continuing offense?</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.617" offset="10418364">I believe there is an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.736" offset="10426932">I believe because they were concerned about the abuses that would result from making this a continuing offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.009" offset="10464026">One has already been suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.084" offset="10476251">Where is the statute of limitations?</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.034" offset="10484088">Apparently, there is none that could very well be infused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.392" offset="10501538">And I say that the type of abuse that could come under this theory of continuing offense, curiously enough is dramatically illustrated in the Government's own brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.618" offset="10554410">On page 19 of the Government's own brief, appears this statement at the top.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.981" offset="10579905">And let me read it and then let me suggest the significance of it, “In this case, the information, which we'll refer to shortly, permitted proof that appellee was willfully remaining in the United States beyond the specified period when he went to Connecticut, regardless of the fact that he was not residing there at the instant his permit expired.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.993" offset="10683873">Now, look where that leads us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.610" offset="10694426">As we look at the record we find that on page 2 is the information and it says, “On or about May 26, 1955 at Bethel, Connecticut within the jurisdiction of the Court, Cores did commit an offense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.522" offset="10778018">Now, they say that under that information, they can introduce proof of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.053" offset="10812186">Now, the offense as shown here, that you'll see also in the record is, he was in Connecticut in May of 1957, two years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.857" offset="10855340">And yet they say under our theory of continuing offense, we can charge a man in an information with an offense on May 26, 1955, he can prepare himself to answer that defense and yet, we can come into Court and show that he committed offense in May 1957 and we can hold him guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.723" offset="10954815">Now, we say that Congress never intended anything like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.059" offset="10976235">We say further that we cannot believe that this Court could put its stamp of approval on any such construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.088" offset="11008313">And I believe it shows very clearly why the Congress did not choose to enlarge this into a continuing offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.524" offset="11054080">As amicus, I believe I have one other responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.434" offset="11069649">That is to protect this man's rights under the record that exist here and I submit to you a curious situation exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.782" offset="11123043">It's a very short record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.559" offset="11134224">As I looked at it, as I read it, as I studied it, I couldn't get over the uneasy feeling that there was something wrong about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.673" offset="11174661">Finally, if the Court will excuse me, I concluded there's something fishy about it, and I -- and I believe there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.558" offset="11206217">As you look at the colloquy between counsel here, for instance, it took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.979" offset="11235892">Apparently, this defendant, Cores, was represented, in big print it says, “For the defendant”.</text>

            <text syncTime="2821.936" offset="11287719">In this colloquy that took place which look, I must say very curious to me, it seemed to -- it didn't seem as though it started at the beginning but that's all that came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.512" offset="11334008">But here, there's a colloquy between judge and counsel but the counsel is a Government counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.725" offset="11358877">There's no time do I see the defendant's counsel saying anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.595" offset="11378312">And yet, the queerest thing about it is that this man is charged with an offense in May of 1955, he knows that he's not guilty of that offense because the Government's attorney says he was in New York for a year before coming to Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.132" offset="11440483">And yet when this man is charged with an offense in May of 1955 for which he knows he's not guilty, there's a record in here as though at one time he tried to plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.382" offset="11485518">Now, I don't know what was going on down below, but it made me very uneasy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.420" offset="11505580">I don't know where his counsel was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.724" offset="11514880">I don't know why there should be any such suggestion because he had a complete defense, not only did he not commit the crime charged in the -- in the information but just one month before this case came up for hearing, was this Tavares case, in which the Court wrote a memorandum and said he had no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.420" offset="11601607">And yet that's not raised in behalf of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.226" offset="11616862">The only thing that saved this defendant below was a conscientious District Judge, named Judge Smith, who had to bring the matter up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.683" offset="11654687">Now, the importance of that is this, in addition to the construction of the statute, which appears to us, clearly means that this is not a continuing crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.417" offset="11721665">There is another reason why the verdict below of dismissal should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.868" offset="11755416">I say that it should be affirmed aside from the other consideration on this record alone, because on page 2 of the record, we see that this man is charged with an offense on May 26, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.802" offset="11827200">Over on page 3 in the first sentence, the Government attorney says, “I'd like to draw the Court's attention, he stayed in New York for about a year before coming to Connecticut.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.114" offset="11868369">I submit what could the Court do and do otherwise?</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.940" offset="11887700">A man is charged with an offense on May 26, 1955, the Government's own proof through statement of counsel is that he did not come to Connecticut for at least a year thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.856" offset="11939422">I think the judge said, “I was given jurisdiction by the charge in the information, you have disproved it to me, I have no alternative but to dismiss.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.809" offset="11983203">Amicus submits that under two theories, both the first one on the construction of the statute, the second one, because the record itself shows lack of jurisdiction, the judgment of the court below should be affirmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="3015.703" offset="12062720">Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.555" offset="12094171">If I understood Mr. Clifford's argument correctly, at one stage he suggested to the Court that in the case of continuing crime offenses, venue should be fixed by the beginning of the crime rather than where it continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.555" offset="12178181">In that regard, I may say that Congress has acted not in this statute but in the -- generally in the -- in the criminal code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.888" offset="12215484">It acted after the decision in the Johnson case, where this Court said that if the Court -- if Congress meant these offenses to be prosecuted in more than one place it should say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.788" offset="12271073">Congress then proceeded in 18 U.S.C. 3237 to say precisely that, to say that when there is a continuing crime, the defendant may be prosecuted in any place where that crime takes place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.181" offset="12336692">And therefore, I suggest to you that there was no necessity when Congress had defined a crime as a continuing one as it is our contention it did in the Immigration Act, no necessity for making a special venue provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.015" offset="12396042">I would like to refer also to this discreancy in the -- in the criminal information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.550" offset="12426136">The criminal information as it is set forth at page 2 of this record is defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.011" offset="12459990">The United States attorney called it to the attention of the Court and -- and told the Court that actually, the man was not in Bethel, Connecticut on May 26, 1955 but that he came there two years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.129" offset="12516415">And so, this would be a situation where it would be necessary to amend the information to conform with the facts in order to -- before the -- before the proceeding would be completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.852" offset="12575347">Rule 7 (e) of the rules of criminal procedure provides specifically for amending information to conform to the facts as they existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.762" offset="12614949">Now of course, if that resulted in a hardship on the alien, if that did prevent him from making his defense, the Court should not exercise its discretion to permit that amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.814" offset="12659252">The Court didn't go into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.832" offset="12663327">Appellate dismissed the complaint entirely on the ground that there was no venue as a matter of law.</text>
