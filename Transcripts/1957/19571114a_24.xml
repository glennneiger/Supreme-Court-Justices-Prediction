            <label>Mr. Earl E. Pollock</label>
            <text syncTime="35.299" offset="141166">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.933" offset="159660">By a coincidence, this case also involves the Detroit-Michigan area and it also involves the problem of discriminatory classification, but instead of dealing with taxes, we're concerned here with Section 2 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.382" offset="241476">The question presented is whether regular and systematic price discrimination which is otherwise unlawful and which is merely an application of the seller's discriminatory pricing policy can be justified under Section 2 (b) as a good faith meeting a competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.922" offset="363624">Section 2 was amended in 1936 by the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.529" offset="390060">As amended, Section 2 (a) prohibits a seller in interstate commerce from discriminating among his customers by granting to certain customers a preferential discount where the effect of that discount maybe to injure competition and where the amount of the discount cannot be justified on the basis of cost saving.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.209" offset="508761">Section 2 (b) however, provides that a seller may rebut a prima facie case against him by showing as an affirmative defense that his discriminatory lower price was made in good faith to meet the equally low price of a competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.651" offset="618580">We are concerned here exclusively with the Section 2 (b) defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.027" offset="640104">Apart form that defense, the illegality of standard discount is now established by prior adjudications.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.841" offset="679288">This case is a sequel to the decision of this Court in 1951 in the case of Standard Oil against the Federal Trade Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.375" offset="721398">In that case, this Court construed Section 2 (b) as providing a complete defense if proven by the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.454" offset="765806">The case was therefore remanded to the Commission for findings on the question whether Standard had established the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.153" offset="816588">On remand, the Commission resolved that question in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.274" offset="837068">It held that Standard had failed to satisfy its burden of proving good faith under Section 2 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="217.926" offset="871654">I intend to discuss the Commission's findings on this issue later but briefly stated, the Commission found that all of the discriminations involved here were not made in response to competitive offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.109" offset="956395">And further more, were not departures from a nondiscriminatory price policy but instead represented only the continuous and regular application of the seller's long established discriminatory policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.240" offset="1064960">In other words, the Commission placed this decision squarely on this Court's decisions in the Staley case and in the later Cement case.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.519" offset="1118041">On judicial review, the Commissioner's decision was set aside by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.829" offset="1151269">The Court after first pointing out that the only question before was one of law found that the Staley and Cement cases were inapplicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.036" offset="1204140">The case is now here on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.668" offset="1226606">At the outset, I think it's most important to understand the basic economic situation which gave rise to this Commission proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.943" offset="1279687">This basic economic situation is reflected in appendix B of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.159" offset="1312601">For the Court's convenience we have reproduced that appendix along with appendix A on a separate sheet and I believe copies have been distributed on the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.634" offset="1370488">As you will see from this diagram, Standard sells in the Detroit area to 362 customers who resell the gasoline at retail to the consuming public.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.668" offset="1454602">All 362 of these customers are in direct competition with each other with respect to the sales at retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.453" offset="1513744">Three hundred and fifty-eight of these customers who are designated in the box on the left side of the diagram as the non-jobber dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.716" offset="1558779">Three hundred and fifty-eight of these customers are typical individually operated filling stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.926" offset="1583647">They buy their price -- they buy their gasoline from Standard at the so-called tank-wagon price.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.657" offset="1618547">Now, this tank-wagon price is 1.5 cents or approx -- approximately 22% higher than the tank-car price, the tank-car price which Standard accords to its other four customers in the Detroit area.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.461" offset="1705796">I might also add that these 358 non-jobber dealers sell approximately 80% of all Standard gasoline in the Detroit area.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.493" offset="1749891">The balance is sold through these other four dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.695" offset="1774759">Now, these four dealers are classified by Standard as so-called jobbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.542" offset="1802136">As you will see from the diagram, three of these four jobbers resell their gasoline both at wholesale, that is, to other retail stations and also at retail to the consuming public.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.906" offset="1879562">The fourth jobber, Ned's, sells exclusively at retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.132" offset="1916447">Now as we've already pointed out, these four jobbers obtain their gasoline on all of their purchases and not merely on wholesale sales, on all of their purchases obtain this gasoline at the so-called tank-car price which is considerably lower than the tank-wagon price which is charged to these 358 non-jobber dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.808" offset="2047164">I want to emphasize that this tank-car price has nothing to do with the typical car-load price which in many industries and from many companies is available to any purchaser who wants to buy more than a less-than-carload shipment for it was Standard's fixed policy that it would never grant this jobber discount, this differential of 1.5 cents on gasoline sold at retail unless the customer had an annual volume of at least one to two million gallons a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.971" offset="2215811">In that respect, this discount is very similar to the cumulative volume discount involved in the Morton Salt case and the discount I might add which the entire course including those who joined the separate opinion condemn.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.002" offset="2291984">Now, in its answer to the Commission's complaint, Standard was quite explicit about that -- the various aspects of this policy, Standard called it, “Its general policy and practice of bona fide selecting and classifying gasoline customers as wholesale or jobber customers as distinguished from retail resellers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="607.355" offset="2429388">Standard stated in its answer that “Such system and practice of selection and classification of customers” was common in the oil industry, it was recognized by many other suppliers as well as Standard, stated that this jobber discount was an intrical and basically essential part of this system and practice and that was the language of the answer, I might add.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.904" offset="2555611">The answer further stated that these four so-called jobbers regardless of how they sold, whether they sell exclusively at retail or partly at retail were entitled to this jobber discount because they met Standard's requirements for jobber status.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.090" offset="2636278">That is, they have the annual volume of one to two million gallons a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.682" offset="2654668">They also have obtained storage and hauling facilities and they have an adequate credit rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.403" offset="2681522">I might add throughout the lengthy hearings in this case, Standard not only did not disavow any of the statements and its answer, but on the contrary introduced voluminous evidence including the testimony of its key officials which was designed to prove each and everyone of the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.652" offset="2770547">We have set out in both our main brief and our reply brief, the copious record citations where these -- this testimony maybe found.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.328" offset="2817254">I might add that the pertinent paragraphs of this answer are set forth as an appendix to our main brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.040" offset="2860095">Now, as far as the Government is concern, it doesn't make any difference at all what this method is called.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.137" offset="2888516">We don't care whether you use Standard's characterization of policy, practice, system, or whether you call it anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.414" offset="2933656">The label is not important.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.036" offset="2944104">What is important here we believe is the content and that content consist of the following elements which are established by Standard's own testimony as well as its formal pleadings in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.047" offset="3012127">I want to add that the Government in this case is not relying to any extent on Government's witnesses or Government's documents in the record.We are relying entirely on Standard's own witnesses and Standard's own pleadings filed during the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.248" offset="3092898">The first element is that Standard had throughout this period at least from 1928 on when Citrin-Kolb, one of these four jobbers was granted this tank-car price.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.029" offset="3144098">Standard has always had two prices, the tank-car price and the tank-wagon price.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.806" offset="3167190">As a matter of fact, Standard's witnesses including a manager of its gasoline department testified that this practice had been going on as far back as he could remember and he apparently got into the industry around 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.491" offset="3225913">In other words, Standard had two prices, the tank-wagon price and the lower tank-car price.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.017" offset="3259977">Two, Standard had fixed criteria for determining who would get this lowered tank-car price.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.306" offset="3293205">Three, these requirements were as I've already mentioned, this annual volume of one to two million galloons a year, the maintenance of bulk storage and hauling facilities, and an adequate credit rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.151" offset="3348584">Four, these requirements were rigidly followed.Standard would give up a customer before it would depart from anyone of these requirements or before it would increase the one-and-one-half-cent differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.131" offset="3412428">Appendix A just above this diagram consist of a pricelist which Standard itself into this -- into this proceeding, and as you will see from the time of the Robinson-Patman Act on, the third column shows the consistency of this jobber discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.392" offset="3489541">At one or two points, the differential was reduced to 1.25 cent or 1 cent for a matter of weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.067" offset="3520261">But the -- this pricelist itself which was furnished by Standard shows the nature of this dual price formula throughout the period in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.118" offset="3576372">The last column on the bottom line shows that the average that the retail dealer margin enjoyed by the tank-wagon customers, that is the so-called non-jobber was 3.3 cents per gallon.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.543" offset="3654113">Now, with this additional 1.5 cent it meant for these four jobbers on all of their retail sales had a margin of 4.8 which gave them even -- after deducting the cost of these various facilities gave them at least a 30% rate of profit margin than the non-jobber customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.782" offset="3763096">And five, every price found to be discriminatory in this proceeding was in exact accord with this formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.163" offset="3808549">Now, on the 2 (b) issue the Commission first address itself to the evidence offered by Standard as to specific offers received by these four jobbers from other suppliers.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.944" offset="3871765">Commission found that during the period in question, there were no offers whatsoever to two of the four jobbers, Stikeman and Wayne and that the offers to Ned's and Citrin-Kolb had nothing to do with the grant or the continuance of this jobber discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.913" offset="3951595">The Commission then turned to the evidence introduced by Standard and there was a good deal of it on this to the effect that if Standard stopped granting this discriminatory lower price and the prior proceedings have established the illegality of this discount apart from 2 (b) that if Standard stopped granting this discriminatory lower price that other companies who are following the same practice, this practice which Standard witnesses characterize as a universal practice in the industry not only in Detroit but through out the country, that if they stopped doing that that these other suppliers who are following the same practice and who would not discontinue their adherence to this policy would obtain these four jobber customers because their requirements for a jobber status were identical to Standard's policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1686.823" offset="6747220">So, that even though the Commission finally made these findings in 1953, the Court of Appeals did not decide the correctness of the Commission's decision until 1956.</text>

            <text syncTime="1969.661" offset="7878635">I do want to repeat that one of the basic assumptions that the Robinson-Patman Act is -- operates on is that it is not -- will not be necessary to bring a separate proceeding like this every time everyone engages in a discriminatory policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1995.089" offset="7980304">I think we would have a right to expect that suppliers not only in Detroit but elsewhere that follow the identical pricing policy would bring their policies in the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.466" offset="8021786">Now, failing that if they refused to do so then of course it would be necessary for the Commission to bring supplemental proceedings, but this is a test case it that respect and an important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.469" offset="8085838">Now, the court below set aside the Commission's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.076" offset="8108304">It held that Staley and Cement were inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.087" offset="8124291">As we understand its opinion which it said is squarely on a legal question and was devoted only to the question of the correctness of the Commission's legal reasoning, the Court held that Stanley and Cement involved only the meeting of illegal prices of competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.606" offset="8222407">Now this analysis, Stanley and Cement, simply cannot be reconciled with the express holdings of -- of those decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.592" offset="8258351">Apparently, Standard recognizes that because Standard has in effect confessed error on the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.866" offset="8287399">Nowhere in its 75 page brief, doesn't attempt to uphold that analysis or that holding of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.620" offset="8330449">Standard now agrees that Stanley and Cement are controlling precedence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.835" offset="8355318">Standard now agrees that its discriminations in order to be justifiable must have occurred in individual transactions, individual competitive situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.668" offset="8402651">It attempts to meet that test however by reliance on a statement in the latter part of the Court's opinion which is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.531" offset="8446119">“Standard sold invariably at its uniform tank-wagon price except when at different times it reduced its price to meet competitive offers in order to retain a customer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.045" offset="8508082">That's at page 5501 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.057" offset="8520202">Standard repeats that again and again throughout its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.897" offset="8535562">It says that thus, the court below decided this case on factual grounds, on factual grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.579" offset="8566282">And according to Standard's analysis of the decision below, the court below actually held that Standard simply met specific offers and departed from a uniform tank-wagon price in individual competitive situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.811" offset="8639216">Now this assertion, this -- or dictum whatever it might be classified as in the opinion below is clearly erroneous and I think we can show that it is quite readily in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.723" offset="8714867">But I do want to point out that if Standard is correct in its analysis of the decision below, that is that the court place its decision on factual grounds we would have a truly extraordinary situation in which a Court of Appeals says, “For purpose of determining our scope of review we say that this is a question of law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.127" offset="8808490">And then having gotten its foot in the door the Court then proceeds to decide the case on factual grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.634" offset="8838478">If that or precisely what happened, what happened here and we don't think so but Standard argues that it -- that is what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.273" offset="8868989">And I think that any such actions in itself which surely require correction by this Court because it was apparent from the discussion of the court below as to whether it was a law of fact question that was trying to overcome the limitations imposed by this Court on the review of factual findings of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.611" offset="8966374">But let's assume that that's what the Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.560" offset="8990198">The Court in making this statement that Standard sold invariably at its uniform tank-wagon price except on different times it reduced its price to meet competitive offers in order to retain a customer obviously refers to the initial grant of the tank-car price to these four customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.864" offset="9071386">Now I'd like to make a categorical statement here which can clarify the -- I hope, the basis or lack of basis for this assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.900" offset="9127497">As to three of these four jobbers, Citrin-Kolb, Stikeman and Wayne, there not only is not insufficient evidence to support the -- this assertion of the court below, there is no evidence to support that assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.426" offset="9217672">Now, if that categorical statement is wrong then I think counsel for Standard should be -- since they placed their case squarely on that one sentence should come forward and tell us with appropriate record citations just who these suppliers were who made these other offers and what the prices were which they offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.732" offset="9326864">Obviously, this must be on the record if their -- if this assertion of the court below can be supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.315" offset="9357166">Now we have at least a number three or four other reasons why this statement is erroneous and we have discussed those in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.458" offset="9393737">But it seems to me that before the Government is under any obligation to undertake or review of the facts of this case the Standard should at least come forward and show us some evidence as to the circumstances involving the grant of jobber status to three of these four jobbers which are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.714" offset="9470851">I would also add that I have some doubt as to whether Standard really is in a position to argue now that the decision below really turned on factual grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.183" offset="9524663">For in its brief below which is on file with the court, Standard said the facts are not in dispute and Standard asked for reversal on the basis of the Commission's own findings as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.125" offset="9588402">Yet, now Standard tells us that the decision below is simply one of fact and that this Court shouldn't wade through the voluminous record in order to overrule the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.774" offset="9643050">I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2452.322" offset="9809189">The practical question from our point of view is whether despite the former decision, prior decision of this Court in this case we still have no right to try to hold these customers by giving them the price that we had to give them in order to meet the lower offers of competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.844" offset="9911275">Now the Court of Appeals found -- held, I should say unanimously that Standard's evidence in support of its Section 2 (b) defense firmly establish that defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.466" offset="9989851">The Court found that there was no basis in the record for the contention that it is made here today that Standard pursued a pricing system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.746" offset="10034887">The Court could find no basis for the contention in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.610" offset="10058397">The Court noted that the findings of the trial examiner which on this point supported the respondent, the finding examiner had found against the respondent on the key issues at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.969" offset="10111791">On this particular point the trial examiner had found for the respondent and the court below was impressed with the fact that the Commission didn't directly challenge those findings when the case was before it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2551.076" offset="10204264">The Court said it could see no basis for the Commission's contention that respondent failed to depart from its otherwise uniform price in specific instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.089" offset="10252330">The Court said the contrary is affirmatively established by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.992" offset="10279915">We say that the decision of the court below is squarely in accord with all of the key pricing Robinson-Patman cases of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.736" offset="10322860">The Court held unanimously beyond for it ventured, that all Standard did was to meet the offers -- the lower offers of competitors in individual instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.662" offset="10374583">And curiously enough, the Attorney General himself in advising the Senate Judiciary Committee as to what the court below held spoke of that decision in precisely those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.766" offset="10427037">The Attorney General said as we say that that is what the -- the lower court held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.949" offset="10471758">Yes, it's part of the background and there is a voluminous background in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.450" offset="10497776">I like to just mention some of the matters in the record apart from the evidence which tend to confirm what the lower court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.309" offset="10529228">The first question we have the trial examiner's findings, unfortunately in this case the trial examiner did a very thorough job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.519" offset="10569979">He summarized the pertinent testimony under the various questions that were presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.162" offset="10596624">He analyzed the competitive offers the testimony concerning them and their impact on the issue of the good faith meeting of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.936" offset="10639673">And he answered each of the questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.902" offset="10655556">He, I think very fairly distilled from the record the essence, the essence of the testimony so that if you read his findings you can see in brief what the -- what the testimony was and you won't find that testimony as much as referred to in the findings of the Commission, of the majority of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.521" offset="10742073">When the matter was decided adversely to respondent by the Commission and was brought before the Commission on a motion for re-argument counsel for respondent at that time called attention to the fact that there was no evidence in the record, as he put it, controverting the good faith meeting of competition defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.126" offset="10840503">And Mr. Walter B. Wooden, then the associate of general counsel of the Federal Trade Commission, the Commission's leading expert on the Robinson-Patman said to the Commission, apparently no evidence controverting that defense was offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.432" offset="10917721">The situation he said is I assume the same as if that matter had been conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.456" offset="10945724">This was in 1946, if Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.267" offset="10965055">And then the matter came before the Court of Appeals on the legal question as to whether the defense is or is not absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.480" offset="11001835">And Judge (Inaudible) writing for that court at that time said the evidence in this record on this issue is voluminous and we can assume that it is conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.588" offset="11070276">The case came before this Court and both opinions -- both opinions, the majority opinion and the minority opinion expressed the review that the defense had been made out at least to this extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.007" offset="11148016">Mr. Justice Burton's opinion for the Court in the footnote distinguishing the Staley case, he says, “Unlike that case, at least the findings of fact of the trial examiner here indicate that the defense was made out" but the Commission refused to give affect to those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.058" offset="11216144">And Mr. Justice Reed in his dissenting opinion said that the elements of the defense were made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.233" offset="11248849">The elements of this defense were made out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.168" offset="11264627">On remand a bare majority of the Commission after holding the matter under advisement for some 15 months and declining to hear from us until after these findings were published and proposed, declining even then to pass on the question of lawfulness of these competitive offers although the mandate of this Court call for a finding on whether the competitive offers were lawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="2971.697" offset="11886759">Let me add to what I've said Mr. Justice Frankfurter that after our oral argument before the Commission on these proposed findings at least one of the Commissioner -- at least one of the Commissioner said that he was going to review the record and he did and the actual findings weren't issued for many months, I think almost a year thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.945" offset="11991771">And Commissioner Caretta prepared and published a dissenting opinion, dissenting from these findings here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.951" offset="12035762">And that dissent is of great significance to -- because like the examiner's findings it is factual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.381" offset="12069512">It -- Commissioner Caretta obviously made an independent study of the record and he summarized the evidence item by item, taking each one of these four jobber customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.662" offset="12122593">And although we're told today that there is no evidence, there is no evidence with respect to two or three of those jobbers with respect to offers to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.023" offset="12156029">Commissioner Caretta found a good deal of evidence and he sets it out in his dissenting opinion on the basis of which he concludes that the respondent in meeting the competition in some instances and refusing to meet competition in other instances acted only as a prudent and reasonable person would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.669" offset="12254668">And so you have on the one hand these numerous appraisals of this record by the very conscientiousness and able trial examiner who undertakes to give the Court the benefit of his analysis of the entire record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.624" offset="12334393">You have the admission of the Associate General Counsel before the Commission itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="3097.531" offset="12390087">And then you have the Caretta dissent in which Commissioner Mason also joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.550" offset="12414119">This was a three-to-two decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.778" offset="12427076">You have all that on the one hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.227" offset="12436898">On the other hand, you have these findings of a bare majority of the Commission which are not detailed, which are generalized, argumentative, they do not purport to illuminate the record, discuss the testimony, they're pretty much directed at the objective that the writer of that opinion of those findings had in mind or at least I so urge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.186" offset="12560718">On those -- in the case of those circumstances with the Court of Appeals having decided that there was no foundation at all in the record for the system, pricing system argument that is made here under numerous decisions by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.968" offset="12655804">I think the initial question here is whether this Court will look further for why it should look further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.226" offset="12696869">At -- as this Court has said, the Supreme Court -- the Congress has -- has denominated the Court of Appeals as the initial reviewer of the findings and whether they are supported by the evidence and certainly it cannot be said in the light of the matters to which I've adverted that the Court of Appeals didn't make a fair assessment of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.927" offset="12803657">It can't be said that reasonable people, reasonable judges, and the position of the judges of the Court of Appeals could not have reached the decision they did, if you don't go beyond what I've already mentioned here.</text>
