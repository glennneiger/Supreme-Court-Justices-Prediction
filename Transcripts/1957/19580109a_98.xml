            <text syncTime="107.684" offset="430707">The respondent was indicted in 1953 for evading income taxes for the five years, 1946 through 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.771" offset="475011">During this time, he was a policeman in Worcester Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.032" offset="492042">The voluminous evidence which was developed over a 12-day trial has been summarized and has put in some detail in our brief.I'd like to summarize it here in a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.869" offset="539376">Respondent was a member of the Worcester Police Department from 1923 until his retirement in 1951, the year after the last year here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.399" offset="589531">His principal duties were motorcycle patrol and vice squads of which he was the head in a few years prior to 1943.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.504" offset="629969">During two of the indictment years, not based on calendar years, but during the period of about two years, he was a -- the license board officer who handled applications for licenses for taxi cabs, gas stations and parking lot within the city of Worcester.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.779" offset="707082">During three years, he was a personnel officer whose duties were those of an inspector.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.165" offset="728607">It was his duty to see that other officers particularly the uniformed officers carried out their duties, their assignments.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.284" offset="761104">At all times, prior to 1945, which is the last of the first years afore which we are here -- which we‘re concerned, his salary was less than $3000.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.283" offset="805094">During the indictment years, it went up until it was $4080 during 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.966" offset="831843">His wife with whom he had married 1933 did not work and had no income and at no time had any gifts or inheritance of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.219" offset="872803">During the years prior to 1946, the respondent and his wife deposited in banks and spent some of the money greatly in excess of their reported income.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.795" offset="919092">At the end of 1945, he and his wife had a net worth of at least $61,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.414" offset="957649">During the indictment years, the respondent reported income bearing from $3200 to $6000.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.374" offset="985443">During the same five years his net worth as was established by proof below, increased by $88,000 to a total of $149,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.654" offset="1034553">This -- there was evidence dividing up these increases by years during the five-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.299" offset="1061094">Funds were divided among nine different accounts in eight different savings institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.388" offset="1093486">And both prior and during the indictment period, he purchased and paid a -- for time and annuity contracts in large amounts, each policies over $25,000 -- each of three policies over $25,000 all purchased in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.396" offset="1153567">And throughout the indictment of five years, he made large purchases in cash continually.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.219" offset="1176869">There were half a dozen or more of over a thousand dollars each in cash enlisted some of them in the reply brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="331.944" offset="1327752">We think the Court -- no, I mean a divide circumstantial evidence up in too many categories which each of which must be proved independently.</text>

            <text syncTime="411.612" offset="1646446">One more item on the fact that I would like to get across is there were some problems of admissions here.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.027" offset="1668075">Mr. Garrity, a lawyer represented the respondent during the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.416" offset="1685629">On four occasions, once in the presence of the respondent himself and three other times with agents, he told the investigating officers that respondent had received grant while he was on the vice squad.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.975" offset="1759817">One of them stated that -- has testified too later that respondent was the number one man responsible for gambling supervision in Worcester.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.329" offset="1817287">Garrity told the agents that respondent had accumulated a cash hoard through graft prior to 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.458" offset="1849783">And during the investigation, this was the general explanation of the ending resulting net worth of $149,000 at the end that he had all these in a cash hoard at the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.102" offset="1908402">He explained he had a net worth in the beginning about $100,000 to $110,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.493" offset="1925956">This would not have explained the entire resulting net worth and Mr. Garrity stated that respondent had inherited a certain sum from his father, an unspecified sum who quote, “Had saved a lot of cash.”</text>
            <text syncTime="497.384" offset="1989486">The respondent's father had accumulated a large sum of cash with reference to liquor sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.748" offset="2010906">Investigation showed that respondent had not inherited any cash from his father and he inherited a half interest in the house in which he was then living and that's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.871" offset="2051448">Investigation also indicated he did not have a cash hoard on-hand at the beginning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.862" offset="7039373">I'd like to direct my attention first to the first of three lines of proof which the Government say are in the case which support the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.063" offset="7088170">The Government in its brief argues and the trial judge at the Court charged the jury that an increase in net worth plus a negation of nontaxable sources is sufficient on which to base a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.269" offset="7165074">I say that clearly under the Holland decision, as well as any other case I have ever read, that that is just not correct law and I have recited in my brief from the opinion of Judge Hand in the Costello case where he talks about just what this Court meant in the Holland decision when it talked about the negation of nontaxable sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.692" offset="7310733">And I think if I may just to read briefly to you just what he says with which I wholly concur, he states however, it is not that it does not follow that all the taxpayer expended was necessarily taxable income or indeed income of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.703" offset="7386802">Conceding something for the difficulty of establishing by impregnable proof, how much was an income?</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.769" offset="7411043">The Court is satisfied with proof of a likely source from which the jury could reasonably find that the net worth increases sprang.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.453" offset="7449809">Through a likely source may not be the true source so that it is necessary in addition to exclude the possibility that what he received did not come from gifts, inheritances or loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.901" offset="7515533">Now, in this case, the only evidence that was introduced as to a likely source were these admissions, which I will come to in a minute, I would like to go -- go ahead to state that the Court of Appeals said on two grounds, one of relevance and one of lack of corroboration that these admissions should not have been received and therefore, it should have been a -- it should have been a directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.517" offset="7653982">And they specifically state in their opinion that they do not disagree or do not either agree or disagree with the Adonis decision of the four decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.046" offset="7704137">In other words, they never came to that point, but that is the first line of proof which the Government apparently argues and as I say as the trial court charged the jury that simply showing the bulge plus the negation of nontaxable sources that that's sufficient in which to base a conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.496" offset="7789923">Do you mean by that that the Court of Appeals said that whether a likely source is necessary or not with this other evidence out, the case is insufficient?</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.047" offset="7828167">Exactly.They never got to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.574" offset="7850214">The second argument which was also charged by the trial judge is the fact that the defendant through his attorney made a calculated fabrication such as we find in the Adonis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.720" offset="7930880">During the course of arguing what the district counsel of Internal Revenue, Mr. Garrity representing the taxpayer, stated that in the year 1949, his client received a sum of money from his father's estate, cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.767" offset="8007053">Mr. (Inaudible) was the district counsel says there was no amount mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.474" offset="8029832">He says it was X dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.298" offset="8037146">Mr. Hirst who was the intelligence agent also at present, his testimony was that no sum was mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.346" offset="8077375">That is what the Government argues and the District Court charged is a calculated fabrication such as we find in the Adonis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.582" offset="8122305">The Court of -- the court below, the Court of Appeals said, “We find without agreeing or disagreeing with the Adonis decision that that evidence is just not that calculated fabrication.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.581" offset="8170266">So that we don't have to have to come to the question as to whether we agree or disagree with the Adonis case and the Adonis case is a -- the defendant was indicted for tax evasion in the year 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.487" offset="8237871">The increase in assets was sum of $38,000 which was represented by the purchase of a house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.283" offset="8265038">And it seems that Mr. Adonis testified in a judicial proceeding in Holland in the year 1951 and he was in -- asked as to the source of the same $38,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.043" offset="8324075">And he gave explanation as to where he got the money, getting it from three different sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.737" offset="8346854">His mother gave him some, the Government at the tax trial, a year or two later proved beyond any question that the mother was impoverished and a very elderly lady living with her -- one of her daughters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.918" offset="8403592">Secondly, there was a question of a highly, just from reading, at a highly fictitious loan and to sum it up very briefly, they completely exploded in the tax trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.790" offset="8451135">Mr. Adonis' explanation is advanced in this Holland judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.191" offset="8476735">The Court in the Third Circuit held that that calculated fabrication could be in effect a substitute for the likely source as I understand it is demanded by the Holland case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.570" offset="8542250">Now, if I may at this point, go back to what I understand, this Court meant in terms of the decisions prior to the Holland case and the Holland case itself as to what was meant by proof of a likely source.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.210" offset="8608810">That was done under the cases in one of two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.863" offset="8623438">First, you show that the taxpayer was in an income producing business, witness the Holland case where he's in a hotel business, the Johnson case where the taxpayer owned a string of gambling houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.782" offset="8675056">The second item is by evidence of specific items of undisclosed income and two illustrations of that is the Chapman case, all of these are cited in the brief, Chapman case where they brought in witnesses that they were paying the defendant over this in-cash, over the ceiling black market payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.178" offset="8768679">In the Skidmore case where the -- where they were paying protection, the bookmakers were paying protection to these fellows on a monthly basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.232" offset="8820924">Now, we filed in this case a motion for bill of particulars and the Government in answer to our bill of particulars as to the question of source, specify that the source of the income in this case were illegal payments received by the defendant in the course of his duties from various people engaged in illegal activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.415" offset="8933564">Well, as far as were concerned, we had no doubt in the world what they were going to introduce evidence of specific payments to him during the prosecution years of graft or bribes, whatever you call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.058" offset="8996153">There is not one eye order of evidence in the case of anything of that nature, not -- not an eye order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.828" offset="9031262">At the morning of the trial and now I'm coming to the question to these admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.020" offset="9047980">On the morning of the trial, we learned for the first time that the Government intends to prove the source in this case basically through admissions of the taxpayer's attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.386" offset="9101479">Now, those occurred on three different occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.866" offset="9123422">In the course of the investigation, of course Mr. Garrity representing the taxpayer was in constant touch with Mr. Hirst who was the intelligence agent and you will find from reading the record that in effect, there's no dispute about the assets or the increases in assets which occurred during the indictment years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.356" offset="9205342">In fact, all of that information was furnished to the Government by Mr. Garrity acting on behalf of the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.136" offset="9240451">The issue was always that Mr. -- that -- the -- the defendant had this money in his possession at the start of the period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.580" offset="9282247">Mr. Garrity pointed out that he was on the vice squad on three different occasions prior to 1945 which is the starting period in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.108" offset="9336372">He was on it for some 10 months back in 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.035" offset="9352046">He was on it for a year and eight months in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.842" offset="9367301">And from 1940 to 1943, some three years, he was in charge of the vice squad.</text>

            <text syncTime="2388.512" offset="9554024">And the only thing that was -- concerned him is the defendant's counsel was -- what he did, did he get any graft during the years under indictment?</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.786" offset="9595089">In any event, the Government seeks to introduce these admissions made by Mr. Garrity to prove likely source.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.317" offset="9637198">At the trial, they were objected to on the grounds that they're irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.007" offset="9656007">Secondly, they're objected to in the grounds of materiality that -- secondly, they're objected to in the grounds of incompetence that whatever knowledge Mr. Garrity would have of Mr. Massei's activities would obviously come to him by a reason of his attorney-client relationship and he certainly would be a violation of that to disclose it.</text>
