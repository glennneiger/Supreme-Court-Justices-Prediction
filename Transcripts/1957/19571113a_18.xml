            <text syncTime="66.133" offset="264464">The assessment on which the tax question here was levied covered personal properties of appellee Murray valued all together at $12,183,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.560" offset="322142">Of this amount, appellee claimed that certain items described as belonging to the United States had been included, the value of which was determined to be $20,43,670.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.678" offset="390687">Such items consisted of basic materials purchased from suppliers by the appellee, an independent sub contractor, which it was processing for parts and components of aircraft and aircraft engines to be delivered to Kaiser Manufacturing Company and Curtis Wright Incorporation respectively, the latter being prime contractors with the United States Air Force and engaged in manufacturing airplanes for the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.317" offset="521195">These assessments appear in the 1952 assessment roll, as charged to Murray Corporation of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.776" offset="559020">On the specific line, the assessing officer, has in each case, stamped this location, assessed subject to prior rights of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.513" offset="606041">These assessments were made under authority of the charter of the City of Detroit and of the general property tax law of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.866" offset="647419">The total amount involved in this specific case is roughly $80,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.443" offset="673750">The amount involved in other cases is much greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.772" offset="695066">The subcontract of Murray with Kaiser consisted of a letter of intent executed on March 23rd 1951 and under this letter of intent, there was included, a partial payment cause which will be discussed later.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.120" offset="780434">Kaiser had a contract running back to the December 20th 1950 with the federal government and Wright had a contract running back to December 12, 1950.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.934" offset="847726">It is Murray. Murray was the subcontractor who was the plaintiff originally in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.263" offset="880953">Kaiser and Wright were prime contractors with the federal government, Murray was a subcontractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.723" offset="914808">The partial payment clause provides in substance that upon the making of any partial payment under the contract, title to all parts, materials, inventory, work-in-process, and non durable tools theretofore acquired or produced by the contractor or subcontractor as the case maybe, and properly chargeable to the contract under sound accounting practice will vest in the government title to all like property thereafter acquired or produced or in connection with the performance of the contract shall also vest in the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.772" offset="1143014">The subcontracts contained a number of reservations and other sub paragraphs immediately following the partial payment title vesting clause, notably the right to acquire and dispose a property is reserved in the subcontractor subject to approval of the terms by the contracting officer, which is of course an employee of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.712" offset="1262759">This right maybe exercised both before and after termination at the option of the government and by termination at the option of the government, it does not mean that that right maybe exercised before or after at the option of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.232" offset="1328901">It means that termination is at the option of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.757" offset="1346978">There was some confusion in the brief of the appellee in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.056" offset="1372160">In any event the proceeds from any disposition of the property were to be paid or credited to the government as a contracting officer might direct so long as such proceeds did not exceeds the balance of any partial payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.279" offset="1441019">Upon liquidation of all partial payments received by the subcontractor, title would then to whatever goods remains would revest in the subcontractor hopping or skipping back from the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.626" offset="1718439">Let us say if the government decided to terminate the contract at any time and it might not be overproduction if there were change in plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.833" offset="1755324">I can readily see how quite a bit of raw materials and working process that had been accumulated would revest in the contractor who would of course have the right to sell it and apply anything over what he would get on redo -- negotiation of its contract at the termination of it to his own profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.572" offset="1846230">The title to the property revest in the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.728" offset="1878831">The partial payments that are important to this particular case were received in October of 1951 and in December of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.571" offset="1930240">In fact in each contract partial payments were received on December 31st 1951 and tax day in Michigan is January 1st of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.776" offset="1979037">This Court has reserved the question of jurisdiction on appeal although granting certiorari in this manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.710" offset="2150818">Coming then to the next point the three major issues involved, and which appear to be agreed upon by all parties, are further the provisions for transfer of title to the United States of material in possession of an independent subcontractor is authorized under federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.869" offset="2235455">Secondly that if the inclusion of title transfer provisions was authorized, did the related contract terms and undisputed course of conduct nevertheless establish ownership in Murray and paper title in the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.164" offset="2300656">And lastly whether or not state and local tax laws and non discriminatory taxes levied there under, valid in much as no direct burden is imposed on the federal government may be levied despite constitutional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.269" offset="2368993">I shall discuss the first two questions and Mr. Ingalls, my associate, shall discuss the last one.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.334" offset="2397309">In this connection also it should be noted that Murray has raised the question of so called collateral attack of government contract in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.105" offset="2436389">It should be noted, however, that we are the defendants of this proceeding and that it was the plaintiffs who is opposing government contract as a means of avoiding this tax and therefore I do not believe that we are collaterally attacking it.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.435" offset="2497724">As a matter of fact, I see no way for this Court to ever get jurisdiction of a contract, and if the work and activities of government contracting officers were sacrosanct and could not be questioned in any proceeding in which a tax was levied.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.554" offset="2582152">As to the power of the federal government to provide for a partial payment title vesting provisions, we have raised the question that Section 3648 of the revised statutes of the United States prevents the advance of public money to be made in any case unless authorized by the appropriation concerned or by other law.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.392" offset="2705554">And it goes on to say that “in all cases of contracts for the performance of any service or the delivery of articles of any description for the use of the United States, payment shall not exceed the value of the service rendered, or of the articles delivered previously to such payment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="694.439" offset="2777652">Now it is to be noted that this section of law refers to advance of public money and not to the fine distinction which we now draw between advance payment and partial payments, advance payments being a loan by the government for which a lien is received and of course partial payments being advances made periodically during the term of the contract secured either by picking titles to the materials or by some other method.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.244" offset="2896875">It is also to be noted in this respect that the interpretations of Section 3648 throughout the history of its existence has required that an equivalent in value be given to the government in return for the advance of public monies.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.540" offset="2982139">In this connection, two statutes are involved under which the appellee and under which the government claims authority to avoid Section 3648 of the revised statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.645" offset="3034488">They are the First War Powers Act and the Armed Services Procurement Act of 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.995" offset="3063954">They also claim some sort of general authority without benefit of any statute, a general authority to enter in to contracts for governmental purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.338" offset="3113273">With reference to the Armed Services Procurement Act, I think it should be stated that the language “use again” which authorizes the making of contracts of any type which in the opinion of the agents it had would best promote the interest of the government refers to generic types of contract rather than to specific and (Inaudible) phrases in contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.404" offset="3233541">On our brief on page 40, there is shown a colloquy between members of Congress and a witness testifying for the Defense Department in which Mr. Cole asked what does that mean that a contract maybe of any type?</text>
            <text syncTime="826.956" offset="3307729">And Mr. Hill replied that prior to the war, the type of contract which was generally used was a lump sum or fixed price type of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.147" offset="3344509">And then he goes on to explain that they are referring to cost plus fix free contacts, costs with the predetermined overhead contracts, time and material contracts, incentive contracts and other types of contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.501" offset="3405949">This we believe to be the true meaning of that section of the Act, and that it does not give the government a general power to make any type of contract in violation of specific statutory prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.630" offset="3474495">Now in the First War Powers Act there is clearly granted authority to enter into all types of partial payment contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.625" offset="3510439">And had this contract been made under the First War Powers Act, I do not believe we would be here in Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.619" offset="3538442">But in the first place this contract specifically cities the Armed Services Procurement Act of 1947 and secondly the authority which was given by Congress to the Executive Branch in the First War Powers Act, although delegated by the President to the Secretary of Defense and by him to the Undersecretary of Defense and through the secretaries of the army, was not so far as we can ascertain ever finally delegated to contracting officers so that its provisions could be used for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.298" offset="3685146">This means of course that these contracting officers quite differently from the claim of the government in their brief, I think it's page 16 of their brief, quite different, it is in their claim, did not have authority under the First War Powers Act to enter into these contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.359" offset="3757349">Now the history of the partial payments causes in this country does not justify the assertion that this type of clause has been permitted to insulate or (Inaudible) Section 3648 for in all cases up to the present type of contract and in the many decisions of the Attorney General, and of the Comptroller General which are mentioned in the briefs of the appellee and of the government, we find that something material was being given in return.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.133" offset="3900500">But in this case, we find that it is cost, the expenses, traveling expenses, (Inaudible) preparations, all of these are part of the costs up on which partial payments are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.120" offset="3964447">And these are intangible items which if the government sought to take possession of them, they would find that there was nothing there to take without forcing that this represents a substantial departure from the original type of situation which we face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.953" offset="4027768">A very good discussion of these is contained in a recent article by Mr. Phelean, Professor Phelean in the summer issue of the Fordham Law Journal and I understand that he was for many years a teacher in The Judge Advocates General School and is one of the authors of the standard text on Army Procurement Law which is utilized by the Army in training its officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.905" offset="4115540">So our position then on this point is simply this that as there is a specific and positive prohibition of law in Section 3648, there can be no general authority claimed in violation of a specific prohibition of Law and that under the remaining statutes there has been delegated to these contracting officers no authority to make this type of a clause and to place it in procurement contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.101" offset="4236330">Now we come to what I feel to be the major consideration in the study of the partial payments clause, and that is the question of whether or not the government took title to the property in question and that is we feel of course always a matter of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.363" offset="4317414">Here the government in Murray seems to be base their entire position on one clause leaving out in a reference to the rest of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.373" offset="4349492">They ask that we look at a language in the partial payments title vesting clause to show that title does pass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.687" offset="4386691">Our position, however, is based on the entire contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.445" offset="4401737">We ask examination of all of the clauses as a related whole for this is the only way at which the true intent of the parties can be ascertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.256" offset="4440921">From an examination of it, it is clear that the government never intended to buy raw material, plant layout, liaison work or other items of costs useful and necessary for the final production of the desired in item.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.956" offset="4507794">The contract authorized Murray, as stated before, to acquire and dispose of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.957" offset="4531827">It gave Murray an unrestricted control over scrap and determined what was scrap and what was not scrap, placed the risk of laws upon Murray and provided for reversion of title to Murray upon liquidation of partial payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.581" offset="4590237">The government's only real interest in Murray's activities were to examine and control accounting procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.806" offset="4619180">And in this connection, it should again be noted the use of this phrase 'properly chargeable under sound accounting practices'.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.995" offset="4651886">In other words. this was a method of cost accounting not a method of determining what property was passed to the government under the title vesting provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.599" offset="4694309">Payments were made upon these costs which included intangible items not upon the value of the materials appropriated for the execution of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.679" offset="4734642">This is not the buying of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.944" offset="4743732">This is simply cost reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.813" offset="4755226">Compare, if you will, this situation, which prevailed in Ansonia -- in the Ansonia case, which is the leading case cited by the appellee in support of the progress -- payments clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.522" offset="4810083">In the Ansonia contract, we find the language parts paid for under the system of partial payment shall become thereby the sole property of the United States and in the Ansonia contract the United States government bought a ship in parts as it was delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.393" offset="4881554">They inspected it, paid for these parts and attached it to the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.689" offset="4898691">This then in each of these cases there was an equivalent for the money which was expended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.706" offset="4930769">The main -- and not only was this an equivalent I should say, but it was -- the equivalent was a main subject of a contract, the thing which the government actually wanted to buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.782" offset="4979043">The conclusion here reached by us in reference to this point is we think heightened by the conduct of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.846" offset="5007360">These practices are set forth beginning on page 69 of our brief and perhaps (Inaudible) were mentioned at this time, but it is important to note that insurance was that the beneficiary of the insurance policy was Murray only, not Murray and the government as their interest might appear or anything of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.308" offset="5089176">That in the conduct of this contract Murray treated this as its own property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.760" offset="5123030">Finally and this is perhaps the more substantial of their argument, the government in Murray urged that ownership passes here because the government wanted to maintain control over materials in the process of defense production, but it is a clear control that comes into being only upon the option of the party whom you desire to control.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.981" offset="5231909">In this connection it should be noted that Kaiser at one time took the partial payments clause out of its contract, out of its prime contract, and that it was reinstated in Kaiser's prime contract only because Murray insisted upon a partial payments clause as a condition of accepting a subcontract with Kaiser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.399" offset="5329502">This means then that as certainly as to the Kaiser contract, the government had no particular interest in the control or production under that contract and that the only reason that in a such control was ever given again would be because of the fact that Murray who wanted financing insisted upon it as a condition of entering into the contract with Kaiser.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.606" offset="5434410">This means I think that we are dealing with a fiction and the proof of that fiction lies in the fact that the power, the option to pass ownership to the government rests with the contractor because it is only he who can then initiate a demand for partial payments and in this case with a subcontractor who was not even a party to the contract with the United States government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.799" offset="5543184">Now many cases are cited in appellee's briefs, but the other two cases other than this one which have the precise clause involved here are United States against Lenox and American Motors against the City of Kenosha.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.192" offset="5600758">In both of these cases, only a paper of security title is found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.372" offset="5621447">In Lenox this interest is designated as an equitable lien and in the Kenosha case, in American Motors against Kenosha, it is designated as a paper i.e. security title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.322" offset="5681215">We believe that the reasoning of the Court in those cases fully explain and justify the position which we have taken in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.287" offset="5713084">And this Court has indicated that they are willing to look through such paper titles because in Allegheny, it was said that where the private interest is so propounding that all the government holds is a naked title and of nominal interest, the whole value is taxable to the equitable owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.677" offset="5790616">Now I would like to say that although we believe that this disposes of the case, we also think that this Court did not take jurisdiction of this clause simply to determine a problem in the law of sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.000" offset="5867938">Rather we think that this action expresses a concern for the problem which local government faces from a further expansion of federal power and a further diminution of the resources necessary to provide essential services at the local level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.934" offset="5935647">It has been estimated that the percentage of total taxes collected by local government has fallen from 56% to 12% between 1932 and 1952 while debt collected by the federal government has arisen from 22% to 75%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.756" offset="6014955">Yet local government must continue to provide the necessary utilities and services for an increasing population and an expanding federal program and these efforts about which are insignificant to the federal government become vital to local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.397" offset="6085486">This tax is one within the traditional ambit of state authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.011" offset="6107951">It is not levied upon and represents no discrimination against the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.947" offset="6135745">It falls upon and it falls equally upon all prime contractors, all private contractors including those who do not have progress payment clauses in their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.939" offset="6183706">There are pot-full claims of ownership here made, founded upon the will of a contracting officer and the decision of a private contractor should not determine whether the doctrine of immunity recognized by the courts as requisite or for our dual form of government should or should not be applied.</text>

            <label>Mr. Vance G. Ingalls</label>
            <text syncTime="1579.752" offset="6318916">(Inaudible) if it please the Court, to supplement my learned colleague's argument I wish to refer the Court to the concern which this Court has had over this problem since 1819 when the great Mr. Chief Justice Marshall and his Court considered a case of McCulloch versus Maryland, which case established the so called doctrine or principle of implied constitutional immunity of the government from taxation, local taxation or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.606" offset="6562377">The case of McCulloch versus Maryland was unique in the history of this principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.835" offset="6615249">In the fact that the case as this Court undoubtedly knows was involved rather a tax which was a discriminatory or political tax levied by the state of Maryland on a branch bank of the United States for the deliberate purpose of destroying that branch bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.667" offset="6714619">In order to protect the new federal government from actions of this kind by not only Maryland, but by other states, Chief Justice Marshall handed down the opinion in that case which established the rule that no tax could be levied upon the means of government operations and any tax or regulation which would hinder or impede or burden or control the operations of the federal government would be invalid under the supremacy clause of the constitution, which provides simply that the laws of Congress are the supreme laws of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.443" offset="6969678">Now the concern of the Court today is the same as the concern of the Court was in 1819 with one exception and that's a very important one we feel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.144" offset="7044493">The history of that case in McCulloch versus Maryland was built up over a long period of years as this Court knows out of a -- out of controversies between the states and the new federal government some of the states resenting the powers of the federal government and seeking to either nullify them or destroy them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.783" offset="7163089">No case since that time that I know of that I have read has involved a tax even remotely like the tax in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.502" offset="7217946">I don't know of any case that's come before this Court since that time, I maybe wrong and I stand to be corrected if there has been one, which involved a discriminatory tax deliberately intended to destroy or impair or interfere with the operations of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.745" offset="7318883">And the tax now before this Court is non-discriminatory tax, as my brother counsel has pointed out, levied in the ordinary course of the City of Detroit and the County of Wayne's taxation procedure under the charter of the City of Detroit and the state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.019" offset="7432046">A tax which is levied in common not only on Murray, but upon all comparable persons in possession or owning personal property in the City of Detroit and the County of Wayne.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.687" offset="7506651">Now, what is the real concern of this Court in a case of this kind?</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.333" offset="7569241">It is merely the question of whether or not if this tax is to be a regulation could in any way threaten a preservation and protection of the supremacy of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.609" offset="7670387">If the tax or the regulation has none of the qualities of destruction or interference with that supremacy, it should be good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.948" offset="7731722">If it has the qualities or the possibilities of interference with the activities of the government and in this instance with the production of aircraft for the Defense Department, then it should be stricken down and I want to say at this point that if counsel for the government or for Murray Corporation can point out any way in which this tax, this assessment can harm the government, can interfere with the production of aircraft, can destroy any instrumentality of the government, then we say the tax is bad, but I don't think they could point out on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2230.726" offset="8922802">That case was a case where the tax itself originally was assessed against a private individual and the lien went into effect when the private individual owned the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.560" offset="8998139">But the government bought the property after that and then they refused to pay the tax and then a proceeding was brought for enforcement of that lien against the government's property which was (Inaudible).</text>

            <text syncTime="4500.248" offset="18000980">And to that point I will now address myself, the partial payment clause, title vesting clause, here before the court is one that has been used for many, many years and it doesn't affect a leasing or a use situation where the contractor gets the use of something.</text>
            <text syncTime="4523.946" offset="18095752">As you pointed out in this Court, in the Ansonia case which goes away back to the early 1900s, this very question was before this Court and there, there was a contract which provided that a ship builder would build a ship and as percentages 10%, 20% and so forth of the work was done on the ship, partial payment would be made to that extent and title would vest in the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4563.234" offset="18252904">And in the Ansonia case, 218 US, the question was whether that was beneficial ownership in title or merely lien type because the State of Virginia lien laws came into apply and if it was merely lien type the Virginia liens would take precedence over the government's title if it was only lien title.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.298" offset="18365127">And this Court pointed out though generally under the law of sales where a manufacturer manufactures and a person buys, title ordinarily does not pass until completion and delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="4610.661" offset="18442553">If the parties clearly indicate by their contract that they intend that title should pass during the course of construction if you please, during the progress of the work and that is clearly stated that title, and it isn't only lien title it's absolute beneficial ownership passes as the work progresses and you so held in Ansonia and I know of no case since then which holds to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.789" offset="18575151">And we say that the title of partial payment title vesting clause in this case and this case used in 80% of the Air Force contracts if you please, the language is clear and unmistaken that this is a payment upon the purchase price, it isn't merely for the use of materials in process in Murray's hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4673.652" offset="18694583">The government wants title to the goods in process while it is being made by Murray, and it is applying that upon the purchase price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4687.735" offset="18750903">The partial payment here is not a loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.953" offset="18767726">It is not an advance which can be repaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.159" offset="18780578">There is no provision for repayment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.811" offset="18791236">Murray could not repay any partial payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4702.039" offset="18808059">There is no interest provided for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4705.007" offset="18819971">It is merely a situation where a contractor is called upon to perform a large contract which will take a lot of time and where lot of money is involved and the government says to him you may get partial payments on the purchase price as the work progresses and the government retains title until the work is completed and the finished end product in which the government wishes for its military service is actually delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4745.474" offset="18981825">And the purpose of that has been demonstrated in many cases, the government wants control of these materials the minute it arrives at the contractors' plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.864" offset="19027383">Some of these goods are of high priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4759.913" offset="19039608">During this period steel and aluminium were in very short supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.460" offset="19061760">They were only gotten by priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.093" offset="19072313">The contractor couldn't use them for his own automative production.</text>
            <text syncTime="4773.409" offset="19093629">The government wanted to be sure that if something happened to the contractor, he failed to perform, or he went bankrupt or whatever the cause maybe that it could step in immediately and take it because it owned it and remove it to another plant for completion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4792.116" offset="19168444">In fact in this very Murray case goods were delivered to other prime contractors at the direction of the government where the other government facilities were in short supply of these goods.</text>

            <text syncTime="5270.566" offset="21082175">The government was interested in those goods from the beginning because the reason I pointed out it wished to have control and we've cited cases in our brief American Boiler, Read-York and others, some involving almost identical partial payments in American Boiler title pass without any payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5290.920" offset="21163677">Payment is not required to vest title if two people, a buyer and seller so agree and completion is not required if they agree under their contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.414" offset="21213623">And the clause here as I say is designed to pay a contractor part of his purchase price as he goes along on a long-term contract instead of making him wait to the end of the road, but there is a distinct difference between advance payments which are loans in advance of anything being done, which the contractor must repay and partial payments, which are payments upon the purchase price which the contractor is neither obliged to pay -- repay nor is he permitted to repay because the government does not wish to give up title to the goods in process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5350.566" offset="21402227">And the only time, I think Justice Burton mentioned this vestiture clause, the only time that comes into play sir is when the contract is complete, the parts have all been delivered and there is some residual material left over of little or no value because the government ultimately wants the end products, holds the title from the beginning and goes through and gets the end product and non durable tools which have low or no value then vest in the contractor, but the goods themselves stay in the government from the beginning until final delivery and it's only this minimal residual material which would cost the government more to move out and store and settle than to leave it there that that clause comes into operation.</text>
