            <label>Mr. Joseph C. Waddy</label>
            <text syncTime="158.555" offset="634149">I simply wanted the Court to know that within the -- this framework of reference that I have mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.749" offset="666958">The effect of the court below in saying that there was no judicially enforceable duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.200" offset="684722">And also, that the Court has held in effect that the statutory representative are in a dispute with the member of a craft or has no judicially enforceable duty and that -- that dispute must be carried to the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.991" offset="763925">Now, the facts are to which this case arises and as alleged in the complaint are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.740" offset="794958">Petitioners are employees of the Texas and New Orleans Railroad working in the Freight House at Houston, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.452" offset="837799">They are Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.405" offset="849607">They are members of a craft or class of station employees, clerks, freight handlers, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.313" offset="885238">And that craft or class is represented by the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks which is the respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.087" offset="916271">The complaint alleges that the Brotherhood has used its statutory position and power under the Act to discriminate against them on a count of their race.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.129" offset="984503">And they claim that the Brotherhood used the union shop amendment to the Railway Labor Act and made an agreement with the carrier requiring that as a condition of continued employment, all members of the craft including these petitioners must join the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.772" offset="1079066">They also charge that at Houston, Texas, respondent maintains two locals.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.915" offset="1111562">One of those locals is composed exclusively of Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.980" offset="1135909">That is Local 6051.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.728" offset="1146880">The other is composed of exclusively of white employees, all being members of the same craft or class.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.150" offset="1180526">They have alleged that the maintenance of these segregated local by the Brotherhood, as a part of a scheme, to deprive the Negroes of the benefits of collective bargaining and not permitting them to participate in the collective bargaining process.</text>

            <text syncTime="323.274" offset="1293061">So far as my information is, they came into existence years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.469" offset="1313855">The two locals, these -- I don't know whether or by request from the Negroes or merely because as a matter of the traditional setup in the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.422" offset="1349590">I suspect it was a traditional setup in the south wherein that Negroes have traditionally been in segregated locals and whites in another.</text>

            <label>Justice Felix Frankfurter</label>
            <text syncTime="345.368" offset="1381460">That is -- this was an old condition when the Railway Labor Act was passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.499" offset="1401940">It was an old condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.945" offset="1407687">However, the requirement for membership only comes into being since 1951 with the amendment to the Railway Labor Act which requires a membership as a condition to continue employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.026" offset="1468082">Now, in addition to that, they claim that Local 28 which is the white local, carries on all of the collective bargaining for the craft, and that Local 6051 does not offer the same type of representation and benefits of collective bargain that those who are members of Local 28 can get.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.654" offset="1570586">In other words that by Local 28 carrying on the collective bargaining and the Negro is being confined for Local 6051 they're cut off from all participation in the collective bargaining process.</text>

            <text syncTime="803.681" offset="3214629">And that notice of the abolition of these jobs was placed on the bulletin board.That the collective bargain and agreement itself require that prior notice to the employees affected would be given, that they have received no notice and that the 45 jobs where all jobs which were occupied by Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.749" offset="3310968">That after petitioners learned of the abolition of their jobs, they requested the General Chairman of Local 28, the respondent here, to take up their grievance and Local 28 and respondent refused to represent them, refused to come to their aid in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.454" offset="3409816">In addition thereto, they claim that all of this conduct on the part of the union was a part of a course of conduct maintained for the purpose of affording inferior representation to the Negro members of the craft or class.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.087" offset="3492258">They alleged that the refusal of the Brotherhood to entertain their request was solely on the basis of race and also that the course of conduct, which they have mentioned, is on the basis of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.796" offset="3575118">Now, it is the position of the petitioners here that the position of the court below, holding that there was no judicially enforceable duty is unsound.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.469" offset="3637812">The Fifth Circuit in a per curiam one sentence opinion cited two cases, number one was the Slocum case and number two was a (Inaudible) case, a Fifth Circuit case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.737" offset="3694864">Now, the Slocum case certainly, in my way of thinking has no application to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.475" offset="3725897">There you have two unions contending between themselves that each of those unions was entitled to how certain work performed by members of their organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.650" offset="3782531">The Railroad Company brought a suit in the State Court of New York asking for a declaratory judgement as to which union should perform this work.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.935" offset="3827670">This Court held that what was necessary in that case was a an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement and that courts were -- have no jurisdiction to interpret the collective bargaining agreement but that it should go to the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.917" offset="3903634">Now, I think that that is entirely a different situation than the one that we have before us in this case, wherein that the suit is against the collective bargaining representative for failure to act and for maintenance of a situation in which the plaintiffs have been discriminated against harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.868" offset="3983464">Now, the (Inaudible) case is a case which came out of the Fifth Circuit and there you had certain airline pilots who had been hired during a strike period by the National Airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.872" offset="4063399">At the end of the strike, these pilots who had been hired to fly the planes during the strike were let out and the old pilots came back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.624" offset="4106449">Thereafter, the old pilots blacklisted the -- the pilots who had worked during the strike and would not let their members fly with them, set out list to other carriers that if they hire these pilots who had worked, that -- during the strike that their men will strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.287" offset="4205087">Two years later, these pilots who had been let out brought a suit against the Airline Pilots Association alleging that the union was the collective bargaining representative of the pilots and was using this position to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.166" offset="4284604">But I think again that here you have a situation where the persons who were bringing the suit had no stand in the suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1424.281" offset="5697097">We feel that the fact that Congress might not have made a specific prohibition of the segregated local was no of apart to the beneficiaries of the statutory power or to carry on segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.166" offset="5800647">In other words, there -- the fact that they did not specifically prohibited and did not say that, “You may not take -- your property without due process there's no authority to take it without due process.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.527" offset="5850070">And in addition to that, we feel that Congress could not constitutionally authorize segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.988" offset="5891866">And furthermore, regardless and whatever they meant in that, we feel further that they did not intend that a situation such as it's shown here, where the employees is forced into the union and then the union refuses to do anything for him after enforcement on the ground was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.938" offset="5967726">Certainly, that situation was not contemplated by the Congress at the time that it amended the statute in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.028" offset="6028016">Now, we feel that the holdings of the court below are first, is unsound because if there is no duty on the part of the collective bargaining representative to represent fairly and to refrain from using its statutory position except in the case of the making of the contract then the union would be free to otherwise discriminate at will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.872" offset="6159464">And there would be nothing whatsoever that a person discriminated against could do and they -- their rights would be completely lost under the operations of a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.588" offset="6214322">We feel that Congress in establishing the Railway Labor Act and placing the duty to represent intended that the duty would be coextensive with the authority and power that was given the representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.307" offset="6285166">And since that is true, the power and authority extends beyond the making of a contract and goes to the entire collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.272" offset="6336993">Now, we feel further that Congress never intended that the Railway Labor Act should be used for the purpose of excluding members of the craft for membership in the union or relocating them to a separate local.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.308" offset="6429153">There, this Court said -- this Court said in the J.I. Case Company case that the very purpose of collective bargaining was to secure for the members of the craft, rights which they could not get individually and then this Court came along in Steele case -- in the Steele case and said that the very purpose of -- of providing for a representative was to secure those benefits of collective bargaining that this Court had mentioned in the J.I. Case Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.448" offset="6573767">We feel also that the decision of the court below is contrary to the opinions of this Court in the Steele, Tunstall, Graham and Howard cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.647" offset="6630504">And particularly, we feel that the Howard case which extended the doctrine of the Steele case which says that the union may not use its position and power to discriminate, certainly goes beyond a question of a making of contract because its position and power are -- is -- are greater than the mere making of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.414" offset="6733636">Now, the court below has further in effect held that the collective bargaining representative might have a dispute with a member of the craft or class and that dispute must be carried to the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.752" offset="6834991">Now, we feel that that is entirely unsound and that this Court said so in Steele that this Court said -- that Section 3 First (i) who had sets up the National Railroad Adjustment Board makes no mention of the dispute between the collective bargaining representative and the individual member of the craft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.748" offset="6918896">Therefore, that you do not have a situation where as any interpretation of the agreement, this is a dispute which was called out from those which were placed under the National Railroad Adjustment Board at the time the statute was amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.694" offset="6974694">We feel further that there is no contract in this case to be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.568" offset="6994233">What we are concerned with here is not the meaning of the contract, the collective bargaining agreement but the conduct of the representative in connection with the representation or lack of representation which this record reveals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2206.693" offset="8826671">His basic proposition of law that the fiduciary duty imposed by the Railway Labor Act on the bargaining representative is not limited to the making of an agreement but extends to the total power or authority of the bargaining representative under the statute may well be correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2266.062" offset="9064176">It will be my purpose to show that when the complaint is carefully analyze with respect to its concrete factual allegations concerning the action and the conduct of respondents or the Brotherhood, I refer to the respondents collectively as a Brotherhood, it fails to establish any abuse of statutory power by the Brotherhood or any breach of its fiduciary duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.028" offset="9176085">In other words, Your Honors, we do not believe that the issues as they have been presented in petitioners brief and as they have been argued here today find support in the concrete facts of this complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="3461.293" offset="13845107">As Mr. Justice Frankfurter has already indicated at the time that the amendment was under consideration in both the Senate and the House, there were very active efforts made to have Congress declare that anyone who maintained a segregated local would be barred from the benefits of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.147" offset="13952522">The Congress expressly -- excuse me sir, expressly refused to so declare.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.258" offset="13988989">They also went so far as to expressly refuse to declare that the denial of admission to membership would be a violation of the union shop provisions of the Railway labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.639" offset="14046459">We have those statements of the House and Senate Committee set forth in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.267" offset="14072999">I won't take the time of the Court to detail them here but they are quite concrete and they do amount to just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.642" offset="14118557">Now, Congress did, however, make its protection to the members of the craft, extend to protection of the workers job in a very carefully condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.268" offset="14193058">The permission it extended for railroads and railroad organizations to make union shop agreements, in such a way that if a man's condition of employment were not extended on a uniform basis available to all other members, then he could get relief under the Railway Labor Act union shop provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.455" offset="14305802">And that is the -- that is the point that we wish to make here in terms of our further argument, this fails to state a justiciable issue, that in the absence of any deprivation of employment or in the absence of any allegation that employment is threatened on the part of any of the petitioners, the maintenance of separate segregated locals even assuming for the purpose of this argument that the Negro members are barred, fails to state a justiciable issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.627" offset="14498482">Now, it is our position with respect to the first claim of the complaint, the allegations of which, boil down actually, all appear in paragraph 7 to which Mr. Justice Frankfurter has pointed on pages 9 and 10 of the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="4243.178" offset="16972696">The -- and I'm going to keep myself within the confines of the allegations of fact in this complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.122" offset="17012402">The Railroad made a lease with the Southern Pacific Transport Company, as a result of which, it lost jurisdiction over the maintenance of certain of the docks and the Freight House.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.114" offset="17072379">It turned that work over under the lease to the Southern Pacific Transport Company and when it did, it curtailed its forces to the extent insofar as petitioners are concerned in the laborers ranks by 45 jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.302" offset="17137162">It abolished those 45 jobs and the petitioners state that the -- a notice was published.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.783" offset="17167047">They go on to state, however, that his action by the Railroad violated the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4297.836" offset="17191288">They don't say wherein it was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.141" offset="17200483">They don't point to any specific provision but they do say that it was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4306.845" offset="17227337">They then say that the Brotherhood suffered this to transpire and did not come to plaintiff's aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.820" offset="17251265">They further state that the Brotherhood did repeatedly fail to hear them on this grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.442" offset="17285747">But then they go ahead and then the very next paragraph in the complaint, they admit that the Brotherhood informed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.829" offset="17327229">That paragraph is -- that I'm now referring to is on page 12 of the record as a part of paragraph 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.844" offset="17359308">The Brotherhood did inform them that what had happened had happened because of the leasing of the potions of the docks at the Houston Freight House by the T.&amp; N.O.

            <text syncTime="4899.028" offset="19596016">There is no claim that the Brotherhood had anything to do with the abolishment of the jobs, had anything to do with the lease, had anything to do with the curtailment on a seniority by the Southern Pacific Transport Company when it hired its own employees, had anything to do with the fact that white people were hired and that colored were not, or that white people were not fired and colored were.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.386" offset="19705522">There isn't a single allegation that the Brotherhood had anything to do with that and they sole charge against the Brotherhood made by this complaint is that they suffered this to happen and did come to plaintiffs aid in terms of preventing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.485" offset="19765917">Now, on that, let's deal with that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.005" offset="19783993">Let's assume that they do have some kind of a duty to come to their aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.161" offset="19800607">That's why I pointed to this particular paragraph to show that the Brotherhood did just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4955.877" offset="19823491">It considered this problem and based on its experience before the Adjustment Board in cases of this kind where a motor company, transport company takes over operations formally approbated by a Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4971.124" offset="19884408">It concluded that it didn't have a sufficient claim against the Railroad and it couldn't do anything about it and it so informed petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="4978.658" offset="19914606">Now, the facts of the complaint itself showed that there's not only -- these operations are now being performed, formerly performed by the Railroad or being performed by the transport company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.937" offset="19963716">They also show there's another union in the picture, the Teamsters Union which petitioners claim they're now required to join instead of the Brotherhood which very clearly points up the fact that the actual situation is a lost of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.394" offset="20029544">The operations of the transport company and their employees are not even subject to the Railway Labor Act, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.520" offset="20053995">They are clearly subject to the National Labor Relations Act and any union is in the picture, namely the Teamsters representing these -- those employees as distinguished from railroad operations where the employees are subject to the Railway Labor Act and represented by the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="5028.618" offset="20114390">Now, I submit, it is not logical to presume, that the Brotherhood of Railway and Steamship Clerks, either in Houston or anywhere else is going to, I believe, sit by and watch its jobs being taken out from under its jurisdiction and members taken out from its union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5050.948" offset="20203729">And those jobs turned over to another corporation, operating under a different Act, and operating in conjunction with a different union if there's anything that can do about it to stop it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5261.034" offset="21044036">Nevertheless, the bargaining representative is not compelled nor could he be as a practical matter, to handle every -- every grievance presented up to the channels on the Railroad, to the highest officer on the carrier and then to the Adjustment Board regardless of the merit that the bargaining representative may conclude that particular grievance has.</text>
            <text syncTime="5286.546" offset="21146122">Now, that is necessarily so and there would be chaos if every single claim regardless of its merit that was presented to the bargaining representative have to be processed by him.</text>

            <text syncTime="5544.617" offset="22178377">As I said, the agreement requires certain things with respect to the union shop provision to the Railway Labor Act and those things required by the agreement are consistent with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5559.696" offset="22238772">So there is no claim that the statute is being violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5563.637" offset="22254446">There is a claim that the agreement necessarily being consistent with the statute which petitioners maintain says, so and so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.427" offset="22293629">There is necessarily the claim that the agreement is not being lived up to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5578.282" offset="22313064">The Railroad is a party to that agreement as well as the Brotherhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="5583.275" offset="22333022">The petitioners in this case could bring that matter before the Adjustment Board as a violation of that agreement by the Railroad because they are just as responsible for its administration as is the Brotherhood, the other party to the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5600.283" offset="22401045">While I'm on that point, I -- I would like to add that the -- although petitioners disclaim in their brief to this Court any connection with the agreement, the complaint specifically ask that the bargaining agreement be construed and their rights declared by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5624.136" offset="22496444">It also asks that the lease be discovered and that its provisions and petitioners rights be declared and we submit that under that kind of -- of situation that obviously, not only as a collective bargaining agreement involved, it is the very basis of the petitioner's cause of action with respect to job abolishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5649.656" offset="22598531">And that is the matter which is peculiarly within the competence of the Railroad Adjustment Board and we believe that the Slocum decision by this Court has more vitality when you consider the lengths to which this Court has gone when it decided M.K.T., the Pitney case, and then the Slocum case, to point out -- and as Your Honor made clear again in likely last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="5680.014" offset="22720052">The extent to which this Court, Mr. Justice Douglas in the General Committee case, going back to 320 U.S., made very clear that the aim and purpose of the Railway Labor Act is industrial self administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.314" offset="22793195">And that the courts have been allowed in only to a very limited and necessary extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5707.199" offset="22828722">That has been stressed time and time again by this Court and it is true that in Steele, you made an exception the day you have to make an exception because you said that a violation of the Railway Labor Act couldn't go on redress and that the Adjustment Board simply wasn't the tribunal to redress that kind of a law and it could obviously, but here, that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5731.780" offset="22927047">And we suggest that the Slocum decision has much more vitality than simply the suggestion that it concerned two unions quarreling over the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5742.876" offset="22971455">Obviously, Slocum means more that that.Slocum means that where there is basically and in substance a dispute over a violation of an agreement that that should be taken to the Adjustment Board at least for instance --</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph C. Waddy</label>
            <text syncTime="5946.265" offset="23785012">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5951.568" offset="23806224">I want to point out one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5957.649" offset="23830570">Throughout Mr. Hickey has taken the position that only one thing is charged here and that is the violation of the collective bargaining agreement by the Railroad Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5970.131" offset="23880516">However, on page 11, paragraph 7 of this complaint, there is a very definite charge that this Brotherhood has repeatedly and without reason declined to hear the complaint of these petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="5995.143" offset="23980513">Now, what he would say that he would go further and say but they do say that the Brotherhood told them that the due to the leasing of this property and nothing could be done about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6009.197" offset="24036728">There is nothing that I find in this record to go to the point where Mr. Hickey went to say that the Brotherhood took up this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6016.225" offset="24064836">The allegation is that the Brotherhood refused to hear them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6020.668" offset="24082599">It never got to the point wherein that -- it could consider the merits of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6026.502" offset="24106005">The allegation of the complaint is that, they refused to hear on the basis of race so that -- so that as to whether their complaint had merit in that or not, they've never reached that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.708" offset="24154802">Now, I submit that Mr. Hickey's position, is this that I go to the court and say to the court that, “Mr. Gardner here assaulted me,” the court said, “No, he didn't,” without hearing any facts or anything and your case is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="6057.943" offset="24231706">I -- I that's -- that's the position that Mr. Hickey would have to state but what is done here is that the union simply has not in any way or heard these plaintiffs and that is the real basis of this complaint, the compelling of the members of the craft, the Negro members of the craft to join the union and then refusing to even consider their claims on a basis of race as for whether they have or have no merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6084.129" offset="24336509">Now, we submit that that's where they would in Howard.</text>
            <text syncTime="6086.772" offset="24347063">It's the use of statutory position and power to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6091.474" offset="24365871">And on the basis of that, we feel that there is definitely a cause of action stated here which this Court should reverse and as a matter of fact for the purpose of reinstating the complaint and to file answers because most of what Mr. Hickey have said is really proof to be used in advertent, plaintiffs were unable to prove their allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6119.154" offset="24476526">That's one thing but as to whether or not that the Court has jurisdiction to hear their claim is another.</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.800" offset="24499200">We submit that there should be a reversal.</text>

            <text syncTime="6150.989" offset="24603899">What the proof to be, I don't know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6153.036" offset="24612049">But I think that that allegation is sufficiently broad so that the proof could show that they had -- that they applied and were not admitted or that they were told by the officer of the Brotherhood that you can't come in number 28, you've got to become (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="6167.179" offset="24668682">I think that proves one thing but the allegation is broad enough sustain the proof in either direction that makes up.</text>
