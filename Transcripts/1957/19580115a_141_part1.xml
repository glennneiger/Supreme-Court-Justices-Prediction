            <text syncTime="47.402" offset="189544">1951, when he was 21 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.437" offset="205740">From May 1952 to May 1953, he saw active service as an artilleryman on the Korean battlefront.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.314" offset="245238">And as a result of his services, he was awarded the Korean Service Medal and the United Nations Service Medal.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.369" offset="277420">On June 30, 1953, he received an honorable separation from the active service.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.858" offset="311380">And pursuant to the statute, he was transferred to the enlisted reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.296" offset="337084">He returned to his civilian life and took up the education that had been interrupted by his induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.261" offset="364983">Two years later, he received from the Army a letter of allegations charging that before his induction, he had engaged in political activity of the nature that the Court is well familiar with, specifically it was charged that he had been a member of the Communist Party when he was 18 or 19 years old, that he had been a member of Labor Youth League when he was 16 or 17 years old, and that he had subscribed to the work and he's been a member of some other organization on the attorney general's list.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.060" offset="512209">He was given an opportunity to have a hearing before an Army Field Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.715" offset="534779">He did not accept that opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.092" offset="544287">In effect, he demurred, saying that as he understood his rights, the Army had no right, constitutional, statutory or in any other way to take action against him now on the basis of lawful pre-induction civilian activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="158.977" offset="635820">The Army notified him two year -- in 1955, which was two years after he had received an honorable separation from the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.374" offset="673437">He was still in the reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.381" offset="689424">And on the 13th day of September, he received a certificate suitable in form but not in content of discharge, which says in large letters, undesirable discharge from the Armed Forces of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.449" offset="761731">And in somewhat smaller letters AR 604-10, which is the security, loyalty regulation of the Army, AR 604-10 applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.211" offset="816797">He brought an action in the District Court, lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.452" offset="837799">The court below saying merely in a single sentence, it had no authority to review the action of the Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.521" offset="869982">He then appealed and the case was argued in the Court of Appeals a few weeks after Harmon.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.712" offset="898821">And the panel that heard the case said that it felt that it was bound by Harmon.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.528" offset="922018">One of the judges, Judge Bazelon, who had dissented in Harmon said, that if you were free to consider the case again, he would dissent again.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.778" offset="955037">And a second of the judges, Judge Fahy said that if he were free to consider the question anew, he would like to consider it anew.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.478" offset="1045838">The position taken by the Government here is much the same position as that taken below, and it is no accident that the appropriate regulations were not printed in the record or in the government's brief in the Harmon case or in this case, because the Government's theory is that it never reaches that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.145" offset="1140506">It is not just a fortuitous matter involved with who wrote the brief that the Government took this extreme position with respect to jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.115" offset="1184392">The position that Judge Black and Justice Brennan mentioned, namely that no matter what the Army does with respect to a discharge, it cannot be reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.341" offset="1221277">That is not an accident because that is precisely the argument and exactly that same bold form that was made in the District Court that was made in the Court of Appeals and then having prevailed in those two courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.896" offset="1279582">It is made here in the boldest possible form namely that when the Army issues a discharge, be it in violation of statute, be it in violation of the Constitution, be it in violation of anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="467.208" offset="1868800">And no suggestion in the law that says that the Army is above review by the courts and that the Army, I believe, alone of all of the agencies of the Government is not subject to review on constitutional grounds by the District Courts and ultimately by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.476" offset="2009861">And I think that Justice Frankfurter in the memorandum filed in the Burns against Wilson pointed out that due process in an Army is not anything like or may not, maybe quite different from due process in civilian life.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.169" offset="2064614">And that there are many rights that a soldier does not have that a civilian does have.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.429" offset="2085616">But there are standards in both the Army, there maybe different standards but there are standards in both which I submit a Court and this Court has ultimately a right to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.639" offset="2142459">Because the Government takes this position, as I say, it never reaches the question of whether the regulations are constitutional or unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.473" offset="2193868">And therefore, I found it unnecessary to refer to the regulations in any extent in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.983" offset="2223856">The second position taken by the Government is that there is no justiciable controversy here.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.194" offset="2256771">And there is no justiciable controversy because the petitioner has not been injured.</text>

            <text syncTime="576.489" offset="2305881">Well, I don't believe that that argument had any place in Harmon but it certainly has no place in this case, because there is a vast difference in legal rights between an employ -- between a soldier who has an honorable discharge and a soldier who has an undesirable discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.374" offset="2381427">In my reply brief, I have set forth as an Appendix a chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.943" offset="2407758">This is a chart that was submitted to a congressional committee by Secretary of Defense Wilson.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.812" offset="2435239">And it sets forth all of the benefits to which shows soldiers are entitled depending on whether their discharge is honorable, general, undesirable, a bad conduct, dishonorable and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="624.476" offset="2497829">That chart is in Appendix 8 of the reply brief filed by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.616" offset="2526459">And Your Honors will know that there are a number of benefits listed to which a soldier with an honorable discharge is entitled, to which a soldier with an undesirable discharge is not eligible and there are many benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.908" offset="2599602">In fact, all of the benefits that are administered by the Veterans Administration to which a soldier with an honorable discharge is eligible as a matter of rank, but a soldier with an undesirable discharge is entitled only after agency review of the facts, presumably as a matter of agency discretion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1198.721" offset="4794828">And that is -- that appears incidentally in the petitioner's brief as an appendix beginning on page 37, at least development portions of it appears at page 37.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.395" offset="4881554">And that regulation as Your Honors will see is what may be characterized as a typical loyalty security regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.866" offset="4919380">It sets forth a series of criteria and standard which begin at page 40 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.664" offset="4954593">Among the criteria that are listed are a number of standards beginning at page 41 which are contained language which is characteristic of all loyalty, security and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.677" offset="5010704">The word subversive appears in substantially every one of these criteria that becomes a sin or at least a criteria to establish or continue a sympathetic association with anybody who -- any representative of foreign nation or whose interest maybe in amicable to the United States or any person who advocates the use of force or violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.998" offset="5123971">It refers to membership in or affiliation or sympathetic association with any subversive organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="1296.076" offset="5184261">Generally speaking, it contains the usual kind of criteria which we find in a much more -- much more extreme form than this Court for example discussed in the Watkins and Sweezy cases where there were some discussions of the use of the word like Un-American and subversive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.297" offset="5269107">Clearly, this regulation is so vague that it could not possibly have given notice to anyone as to what activities he could have engaged in lawfully.</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.938" offset="5319680">As a matter of fact, the notice wouldn't have been any good even if it had been cleared because this regulation wasn't passed until long after this man was inducted into the Army.</text>
