            <text syncTime="28.790" offset="115148">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.781" offset="179096">This is a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.996" offset="195918">I represent a prisoner in the Illinois Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.854" offset="215353">He is serving a sentence, a life sentence for bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.572" offset="238237">This Court granted his petition for certiorari from the Illinois Supreme Court's affirmance of his conviction and appointed counsel for petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.754" offset="282958">Our principal -- our principal contention is that the State of Illinois has not accorded petitioner due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.682" offset="330710">We submit that the facts of this case show a disregard of due process in several quite different respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.493" offset="365923">The variety of bad procedures that were applied to this man is striking.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.833" offset="391314">The procedural facts surrounding his trial are malodorous, but the Court need not reach the doctrine of the facts as a whole being so shocking as to deny the due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.164" offset="444604">We contend that they are with the specific denials of due process or in themselves quite sufficient grounds for reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.364" offset="481384">The two most critical issues are, first, that Illinois tried him over again after he had been acquitted by a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.981" offset="523912">And second, and it is entirely separate and independent ground of reversal, that Illinois convicted him on the basis of unconstitutional activities of federal officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.474" offset="577829">Here are the facts and they are not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.454" offset="589740">In 1953, a savings and loan association in Cooke County was robbed by two arms men.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.250" offset="616908">They took some $4000 and fled in a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.194" offset="636761">The driver was waiting in the car, petitioner, then 26 years old, heard that he was wanted and he went to United States Marshal's Office where he was arrested and charged with being the driver of that car.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.255" offset="684931">And his defense was simply that they had the wrong man.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.239" offset="700918">At the trial of petitioner, the identity of the driver of the car was the only issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.260" offset="729025">He took the stand, he and other witnesses testified that he was far away from the robbery at the time it occurred and the testimony against him was by alleged accomplices.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.056" offset="784196">This trial was in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and it was for violation of the Federal Bank Robbery Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.640" offset="814498">The basis of federal jurisdiction was the savings and loan association, which was robbed, was federally insured, insured for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.139" offset="864549">Incidentally, 94% of all savings and loan associations in this country are federally insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.716" offset="894851">And the existence of the insurance was stipulated in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="272.656" offset="1090560">The United States District Judge was dissatisfied with the verdict and he proceeded to criticize the jury in most unusual fashion.Some of the details are in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.502" offset="1133923">The judge's conduct and the widespread publicity that was given to it were of the nature to encourage the retrial of petitioner in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.039" offset="1172062">And the States Attorney of Cooke County said on the record that the federal authorities came to him after petitioner's federal acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.572" offset="1210201">Petitioner was turned over to state custody and indicted the second time for the same robbery.</text>

            <text syncTime="601.292" offset="2405146">The issue in the second trial, as I have said, was the same as in the first and that issue was the identity of the person driving the car used in the escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.543" offset="2434090">This is all perfectly clear from the opinion of the Illinois Supreme Court, and it is not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.791" offset="2455092">And petitioner was found guilty in the second case.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.369" offset="2473378">Now, the reason why he received life imprisonment was because it was mandatory under the Illinois second offender statute then enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.373" offset="2517473">That statute provided that a prior conviction in a different case be mentioned in the indictment and brought to the attention of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.231" offset="2556865">And there are statutes like that in a number -- in the number of States.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.800" offset="2575151">And that feature of the statute, however, I am glad to say has been repealed this year, so that Illinois is no longer in what I regard as the disgraceful position for juries are told of former offenses, where they must be told a former offenses if the habitual criminal feature is to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.224" offset="2640875">If the second offender feature is to be used, you have to put it in the indictment under this old statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.451" offset="2661773">But, of course, the repeal is not retroactive, it does not apply to my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.443" offset="2685701">Now, in addition to these two points I have mentioned, and we do, in our brief, raised as an independent ground of reversal, but we regard as an extremely unfair application of that provision to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.399" offset="2737528">And I'm sure we will not have time today to argue with it orally.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.226" offset="2760829">Today, I want to argue with three grounds of reversal orally, and they are separate and independent grounds of each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.376" offset="2785489">One is that petitioner was tried over again after being acquitted for identically the same affair.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.054" offset="2816209">The second is the unconstitutional participation of the federal officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.380" offset="2833450">And the third is encroachment by the State of Illinois on the judicial power of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.390" offset="2861558">Now, on our first point, it's undisputed that the second trial different from the first in only two respects, the fact that the federal insurance did not have to be proved in the state case.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.114" offset="2928431">And the second trial occurred in the state court rather in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.098" offset="2944313">Those are the only differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.162" offset="2956643">Now, such differences have been thought in various cases to permit double prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.485" offset="2989871">But we disagree and we contend that from the standpoint of due process, those two differences are not of a nature to justify a second trial for what is in fact the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.817" offset="3047236">Due Process is, of course, a matter of substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.608" offset="3062387">And this question is an open question for this Court, as I propose to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.777" offset="3091017">Putting it in other words, I propose to show that it was the same offense in both trials, the same offense in both trials, and that the matter of the difference in jurisdictions ought not to make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.254" offset="3149009">Now, of course, our premise is that under the Fourteenth Amendment, the State of Illinois, by itself, may not keep on prosecuting a man after he has been acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.788" offset="3211076">Our position here is based on the defense in this -- this big part of our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.894" offset="3227481">Our position is based on the defense of former acquittal not on double jeopardy as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.209" offset="3256738">We contend that the inviability of a former acquittal is part of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.919" offset="3283592">And Palko against Connecticut and other cases of this Court have expressly left that question open.</text>

            <text syncTime="839.968" offset="3359869">I'm candid to say, Mr. Justice, that that is not our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.032" offset="3376065">Our case is acquittal and acquittal is thoroughly distinguishable from former conviction that has -- that has been distinguished as we show in our briefs since the time of the yearbooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.979" offset="3427892">It's absolutely fundamental part of order of liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.960" offset="3443775">It goes back way behind -- before the right of counsel and it is -- if you think that defense of former conviction which is always -- as a separate plea of common law, if you feel that that is a separate -- is a separate matter and is important and is part of due process, why, former acquittal is even more sacred.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.997" offset="3543980">Now, today, I'm going to assume that it is clear beyond doubt that Illinois couldn't try a man who've been acquitted over again for identically the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.916" offset="3591628">I mean take the example which is not our case with a crime for something that is admittedly the same offense under, identically, the same statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.260" offset="3633006">I don't believe that the Illinois was seriously content that it will keep on trying a man over again under the same statute for the -- for the same offense constitutionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.535" offset="3682116">I'd say -- I believe we have lots of material but I will assume it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.290" offset="3713149">Now, leaving aside for the moment the matter of the two jurisdictions, the state and the federal, we contend that the federal and state offenses are the same offense for purposes of double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.279" offset="3765081">In other words, before we get to the matter of the two jurisdictions, I must first persuade you that neither the Federal Government acting alone nor the State acting alone could try a man twice for the same act of robbery under two federal statutes that are similar as these two statutes here or under two state statutes, it different no more than the two statutes in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.545" offset="3866122">That's what I must persuade you first.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.663" offset="3874586">Later, we reach our position that what they cannot do separately, they cannot do in combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.751" offset="3910949">Defendant was tried the second time for identically the same convict as in the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.943" offset="3931742">He wasn't accused of robbing different banks or different people as in the whole case that has been set to follow this case in argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.318" offset="3973224">Our case now is not a case involving fragmentation of crime for purposes of increasing the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.792" offset="4003109">That's like the Ladner case which comes after the Hoag case that has been set in this group of three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.285" offset="4029127">Ladner is a punishment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.208" offset="4040829">It's not a double jeopardy case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.410" offset="4049607">There was only one trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.152" offset="4056607">You can't have double jeopardy unless there are two trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.795" offset="4075102">And what isn't appropriate unit of crime, unit of the crime or unit of prosecution is -- is a different thing in punishment cases and it isn't a double jeopardy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.381" offset="4133512">The appropriate -- the appropriate unit might permit a man's punishment to be increased if it cuts more mail bags, for example, or if he steals more money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.267" offset="4173009">But that doesn't mean that a man can constitutionally be retried for each unit or for each piece of paper money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.826" offset="4215223">Punishment can be graded for -- for the size and number of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.219" offset="4232777">It's -- it's clear from reading all these cases that there is no such thing as a unit of the crime for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.043" offset="4276140">Now, this Court has ruled that there are two offenses for purposes of double jeopardy and each statute requires proof of an additional fact which the other statute does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.520" offset="4325982">But surely, this is basic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.844" offset="4343327">That's separate fact must have some significance, some significance in the way of a separate statutory purpose or policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.062" offset="4384183">And I think I can demonstrate that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.537" offset="4394109">The Federal Bank Robbery Act makes it a crime to rob a national bank, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and maybe those are separate offenses now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.807" offset="4463177">But let's suppose the Congress removes all question and specifically makes them separate offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.500" offset="4489927">In similar fashion, Illinois could, of course, make separate offenses of robbing a state bank, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the States, of course, are free to -- to protect federal institutions and separate offensive robbery in the bank building, robbery after nightfall, robbery with a gun, robbery with a mask, a dozen more offenses, each with its unique fact to be proved as required by that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.078" offset="4604238">And those would be perfectly good separate offenses for purposes of counts and for purposes of punishment, for purposes of the prosecutor's option as to which he shall try.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.204" offset="4648751">But it is a very different thing to say that they create separate offenses so as to allow a man to be acquitted one or more times and then tried over and over again for the same transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.268" offset="4705071">I'm sure this Court would never stand for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.479" offset="4717819">Unless this separate fact in each of these statutes would reflect some separate purpose or policy to permit retrials would reduce the Constitution -- would -- would deprive the Constitution of substance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1449.501" offset="5797930">And the jurisdictional requirement, the jurisdictional requirement of federal insurance in the case of bank robbery is like the jurisdictional requirement that for Illinois to prosecute, the offense must be committed in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.645" offset="5854563">That must be proved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1470.806" offset="5883193">But, of course, the act was committed in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.883" offset="5895523">Well, here, we have -- we have to prove the jurisdictional requirement and the crime had to be proved that this institution was robbed, the institution was insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.531" offset="5954038">A decision for petitioner would not create a precedent against retrials in -- in civil rights cases or in any other case where the Court inquires into the matter to find out whether there's a substantial difference in these statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.650" offset="6026553">In our reply brief, on page 5, we show how foreign countries will not retry a man who's been acquitted in another country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.150" offset="6068558">The notion that because there are two sovereignties, you should try a man over again is -- is not only unfounded and as far as the common law jurisdictions are concern, it is unfounded as far as -- as most -- more advanced European countries are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.265" offset="6129058">But they won't retry a man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.813" offset="6139193">But there's always an exception under the law of France and those -- some other countries, in treason or other national security cases because there, the foreign country would have a different policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.711" offset="6186841">But everybody is united, all countries, all civilized countries and certainly, the States and the nation are united in one common policy against bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.512" offset="6238041">But the mere fact that federal jurisdiction alone cannot create a separate policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.731" offset="6270851">That's the -- that's -- that seemed to be sufficiently clear that couldn't be done but we can go back to the fact that the States are free to enforce federal -- protect federal rights in the early part of the history of our country that that was the standard way for the first -- for the first half century I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.506" offset="6349949">The states courts -- and states were largely relied upon to protect federal rights as in counterfeiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.234" offset="6380878">And a State could pass a statute making it a crime to rob a bank.It's a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.584" offset="6422256">Let's say that -- that -- the State having to create in such a crime and the Federal Government having also create in such a crime, makes it necessarily a separate policy because the -- because the jurisdictions are different, because the Federal Government always have a separate policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.094" offset="6488294">It's obviously without substance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.190" offset="6852754">And the rationale, of course, is that if it was collusive, why the man was never in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.622" offset="6882429">Now, I've come to the critical issue of prosecution by different jurisdictions where the Court finds the offenses would otherwise be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.889" offset="6923494">In the first place, the defense of former acquittal is for the protection of the accused and is neither the protection is identically the same whether the successive prosecutions or by the same or separate sovereignties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.072" offset="6980232">The injustice to him is the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="1750.346" offset="7001339">And it is my contention that both on reason and on authority, the two -- the two situations should be treated in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.596" offset="7038328">Now, the English common law authorities are clearly and flatly on our side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.298" offset="7061107">As early as 1678, it was settled in the leading case of Rex against Hutchinson, on our brief at page 40, that a man acquitted in Portugal could not be tried again in England.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.136" offset="7104470">And there are other -- other cases just as strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.717" offset="7118785">Our brief cites them and also American Colonial materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.786" offset="7139056">Now, there's quite a number of state and lower federal court cases against us but they do not seem at all persuasive and neither or certain dicta of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.589" offset="7182315">And as for the dicta of this Court, their expressions of this Court also on our side and in our brief, we analyzed those and fully discussed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.093" offset="7224320">We discussed the liquor prohibition case of United States against Lanza decided in 1922 which is a weak and distinguishable case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.779" offset="7263086">It is exclusively argued as a construction of the Volstead Act and the Court, in dealing with the constitutional question, considered only the effect of the Eighteenth Amendment Clause which gives the States concurrent jurisdiction, concurrent power to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.209" offset="7336751">And this concurrent power to enforce didn't occur to that phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.727" offset="7346887">It occurs nowhere else in the Constitution, and it's now out of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.749" offset="7366949">Furthermore, in Lanza, there had been a prior conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.361" offset="7381368">It wasn't an acquittal and the case has been severely criticized by Professor Grant in his article that accompanies our brief by Professor Wexler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.352" offset="7421388">The American Law Institute is against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.320" offset="7433195">Now, in this Lanza case furthermore, the vital common law authorities were not mentioned in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.238" offset="7452944">I've read them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.363" offset="7461407">And the case has other weaknesses that I'll go into in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.597" offset="7482305">For one thing, the first trial doesn't seem to have been a jury trial which has an application that I'll come to in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.156" offset="7508532">It's clear that the issue of whether the one jurisdiction can retry a man acquitted by the other is still an open question for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.247" offset="7556911">Now, once Lanza is eliminated, the only remaining argument for double trials is that the federal-state relationship requires it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.254" offset="7592960">The argument implies that expediency and the practicalities of American federalism require us to do something that is otherwise constitutionally treated as an injustice and something which England and France, for example, will not do as between foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.479" offset="7669864">Now, I propose to show that not only does American federalism not require such a shameful result but that in practice and policy, federal-state relations would be improved if it would -- do not -- if you don't have it, it actually be harmed by the extension of any such rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.608" offset="7742380">The heart of the argument, of course, is that unless the State is allowed to relitigate federal criminal judgments, the Federal Government would equally be prevented from relitigating state judgments and that would be a limitation on the federal judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.396" offset="7817509">Now, we think -- I think the rule ought to work both ways, state and federal and federal and state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.820" offset="7843213">But we do not agree that the Federal Government can or should try a man over again who's been acquitted by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.426" offset="7873620">For one thing, the Seventh Amendment prevents it, at least if the man was tried by a jury, and that's why I alluded to the fact that I can't find any evidence that in Lanza, the man was tried by the State of Washington jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.325" offset="7929208">But those are jury in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.076" offset="7936209">The petitioner was acquitted by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.677" offset="7946658">In this connection, I refer to the second clause of the Seventh Amendment which is a relatively unfamiliar part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.937" offset="7971736">Unfamiliar at least, as I judge, because they're -- how do you know a case is on it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.912" offset="7987618">Here's what it says, I'll read it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2142.354" offset="8569313">But, when they came around to adopting the Bill of Rights, the shoe is on the other foot and at that time, it would not have been at all popular to suggest it that -- that criminal verdicts could be reexamined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.136" offset="8632529">But even -- but take on reason, Holmes said for unanimous court in the Oppenheimer case, it cannot be that the safeguards of the person are less than the safeguards that protect from a liability in debt and Stoll against Gottlieb in 305 United States with the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.775" offset="8715076">If the second clause of the Seventh Amendment is, by any possibility, applicable only to civil trials, it must have been because everybody assumed that the reexamination of state criminal verdicts was forbidden elsewhere in the Constitution and there was a plain clause in there to which that construction could readily be given, namely, the double jeopardy provision of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.924" offset="8807654">It seems to me in its inescapable inference from the second clause of the Seventh Amendment that a federal retrial after a state acquittal is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.169" offset="8852584">We have some historical materials that we cite in our brief that support this to some extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.806" offset="8887171">So even if this Court is not convinced by this argument based on the Seventh Amendment, I submit that it is unsound federalism to call another jury of Illinois citizens to try a man over again who has been acquitted by one jury of Illinois citizens.</text>

            <text syncTime="2263.384" offset="9053518">And there are other and better ways in protecting federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.751" offset="9070968">Congress can always take over the field to a greater or less extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.546" offset="9086119">There is always federal preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.870" offset="9099389">The only purpose of a federal retrial is to assert federal supremacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.500" offset="9117989">And the normal way to do this, the normal constitutional way to do it is through the preemption power and the resources of federal preemption or ample and manifold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.429" offset="9165636">It wouldn't be necessary for Congress to take over the whole of any field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.480" offset="9177861">That's not an attractive remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.667" offset="9186638">Concurrent jurisdiction is a great part of our constitutional system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.555" offset="9206178">But there could be easily be a partial preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.480" offset="9213910">For example, the Congress might provide that a State couldn't prosecute for federal bank robbery until, say, 30 days after notifying the United States Attorney, so that he would have an opportunity to proceed first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.793" offset="9259154">That would produce only one trial and would preserve federal supremacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.289" offset="9285068">There's no reason for worrying about loosing anything by depriving the Federal Government of the right to try a man, an -- an acquitted man over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.233" offset="9328849">In our brief, we cite materials to show that double prosecutions are not favored by either the States or the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.067" offset="9360196">The American Law Institute is against them and most people don't think they can take place when the -- when the statute against interstate transportation of automobiles to direct was passed and that was a few years before Lanza.</text>

            <text syncTime="2356.520" offset="9426024">But Mr. Dyer (ph) explained to Congress that where a man has been tried upon the merits in a criminal matter and the case has been disposed of, why, is not a bar anyway to further prosecution and they left it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.980" offset="9479837">While the State and the nation are separate sovereignties, they're not separate like foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.804" offset="9507213">Suppose a man shot across a state line, now, in other cases to the effect that an acquittal or conviction in one State is not a bar to a prosecution in the other but that is not the view of Justice Brewer of this Court, who, for a unanimous court in 1909 said, "Where an act is malum in se prohibited and punishable by the laws of both States, the one first acquiring jurisdiction of the person may prosecute the offense, and its judgement is a finality in both States, so that one convicted," I'm still quoting, "so that one convicted or acquitted in the courts of the one State cannot be prosecuted for the same offense in the courts of the other.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.466" offset="9681816">Now, that was dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.299" offset="9689130">But this Court has never held to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.730" offset="9698847">And we submit that it expresses the proper rule for all situations of concurrent jurisdiction between different States or between the States and the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.142" offset="9736568">And that is the -- is the rule of sound federalism that Congress protect the federal jurisdiction under the Supremacy Clause in any one of the manifold number of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2527.546" offset="10110119">Our third major ground for reversal is completely independent of the Fourteenth Amendment and it is that retrial by a State after a judgement of acquittal by a federal court is an unconstitutional encroachment on the federal judicial power.</text>

            <text syncTime="2563.472" offset="10253793">Now, here is the point in the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.857" offset="10263406">After a federal court has tried a man and acquitted him, is it not a mockery of the federal judicial power for the State to retry him for the same offense and reverse the decision?</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.390" offset="10325473">If Lanza is not limited by the present case, the States will be invited to engage in the general practice of trying people over again on the same accusation which they've been acquitted in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.759" offset="10378971">They've made -- many prosecutors may feel it's their unwelcome duty to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.593" offset="10398302">The States may create state offenses exactly paralleling federal offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.920" offset="10423589">Finality of judgement is an essential attribute of judicial power and if -- within the situation I have suggested that -- that occurred, finality of judgement would be gone and that judicial power has been occupied by legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.857" offset="10495373">Congress has already acted to give the federal courts authority to exercise the federal judicial power to prevent this violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.884" offset="10523481">Section 1738 of the Judicial Code requires the States to give full faith and credit to federal judicial proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2821.809" offset="11287197">And in Palko against Connecticut, to which I know I address myself, this Court has held that even acquittal in the courts of a State doesn't bar retrial in the courts of that State under the Fourteenth Amendment if there's nothing in the state law to inhibit such retrial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3012.334" offset="12049241">I beg your pardon, there was one dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.303" offset="12081110">Mr -- Mr. Justice Cardozo held in the plainest of terms that the Due Process Clause does not, of its own vigor, inhibit retrials even by the same sovereign and even after acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.801" offset="12199184">I -- I'm aware that the Court does not like extended reading from the text but there are two sentences of Mr. Justice Cardozo, with the Chief Justice's permission, I should like to read and adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.066" offset="12288209">He says at page 323 of the official report, “Right mind of men, as we learn from these opinions, could reasonably even mistakenly believe that a second trial was lawful and prosecution subject to the Fifth Amendment if it was all in the same case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.739" offset="12378906">Even more plainly, right minded men could reasonably believe than in spousing that conclusion, they were not favoring a practice repugnant to the conscience of mankind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.091" offset="12428330">And Mr. Justice Cardozo declared that retrials after acquittal do not so violate the concept of ordered liberty as to deny due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.200" offset="12520699">Now, if the Court please, a leading case, and I want to say that Illinois is fully cognizant that on this Court's grant of certiorari, question is presumably open here for reconsideration on principle notwithstanding the pronouncements of earlier decisions, but a case that explorers, the conception of dual sovereignty extensively and imported the major deliberations and conclusions of this Court is United States against Lanza in 260 U.S. 377.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.074" offset="12748278">In that case, the defendants were charged in the federal court with the sale, manufacture, transporting and having in their possession of the same liquor is that involve in the state prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.517" offset="12814002">Now, it's true, as petitioner's counsel points out that in the Lanza case, there had been no trial in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.725" offset="12854857">That is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.083" offset="12860291">Nevertheless, the case was argued, considered and treated in and by this Court as involving the question of the right of both sovereigns, national and state to prosecute the same defendants for the same alleged offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.118" offset="12948376">And in the Lanza case, again, if I may read just a few words, the Court said at page 382, “We have here two sovereignties deriving power from different sources capable of dealing with the same subject matter within the same territory.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.550" offset="13026116">Continuing Mr. Cardozo says, “Each may, without interference by the other enact laws to secure prohibition where the end that no legislation can give validity to acts prohibited by the Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.218" offset="13104797">The Court goes on to say that every citizens of the United States is also a citizen of a State or territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.413" offset="13137607">And in Moore against Illinois, now, that case involved a violation of the slave -- slavery laws so it is not exactly an advance sheet case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.330" offset="13193300">But in that case, the Supreme Court of the United States declared, as the Court held in the Lanza case, that every citizens of the United States is also a citizen of a State or territory that he may be said to allow or allegiance to do sovereigns and maybe liable to punishment for an infraction of the laws of either.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.163" offset="13320568">Now, even when the same sovereign prosecutes for the same state of facts, if the same state of facts constitutes two separate offenses such that although only one set of fact is involved, each offense, the offenses are not identical and in one offense, something has to be proved that does not have to be proved in the other offense, dual prosecution does not result in double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.457" offset="13485767">The expressions of this Court on the point are rather few, but in the case of Carter against McClaughry, 183 U.S. 365, cited in our brief, this case had before a habeas corpus proceeding that arose in the military law, a court-martial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.586" offset="13598302">In that case, the officer had been charged separately with the making of false federal warrants or requisition for funds and with an attempt to defraud the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.149" offset="13672594">What he had actually done was obtained the money from the United States by false warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.774" offset="13715017">And this Court held that a conviction upon both of those specifications didn't vitiate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.144" offset="13748558">It was not vitiated by the inhibitions against double jeopardy and quoting from an opinion by Mr. Justice Gray in the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, the Court says, “The conviction or acquittal, the conviction or acquittal upon when indictment is no barred with subsequent conviction and sentence upon another unless the evidence required to support a conviction upon one of them would have been sufficient to warrant a conviction upon the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.721" offset="13870811">Now, I think, Your Honors, that I can best express the gist of Illinois' contention in these considerations and reflections.We realized that on Constitution or any other question that come before this Court, consensus, virtue unanimity or even complete unanimity of juridical thought on the part of lower courts, law professors, writers, other jurists, even this Court's own previous decisions are never conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.028" offset="14064013">But the question involved in this case, Your Honors, is whether the retrial by Illinois of a man who has been acquitted in the federal courts for the same alleged malefactions, so violence the concept of ordered liberty, so offense the universal sense of justice as to deny due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.453" offset="14213747">Now, I submit, Your Honors, with all the earnestness of my command that when a prosecution is in accordance with the overwhelming consensus of juridical opinion, both that of courts and that of commentary, it can't possible so far offend the concept of ordered liberty as to deny due process and until this Court granted certiorari in this and to companion cases, there wasn't, so far as my researches have gone or so far as Mr. Fisher's researches have gone at least in contemporary times, there was a time when the question had not been the subject of expression, very much any doubt at all that prosecutions by two sovereigns were permissible and admissible even though the same facts were relied upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.458" offset="14537770">I might say in passing that the federal statute did require a proof of one additional element that was not required by the Illinois statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.032" offset="14588029">And that additional element was that the institution that was the subject of the robbery must have been federally insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.194" offset="14620735">In that case -- in this case, however, the effect of such federal insurance was supplied by stipulation but I don't rest my argument principally upon the ground that Illinois had to prove less to convict the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.834" offset="14695236">Less facts, I don't mean -- I didn't have to prove the facts but it did have to prove beyond all reasonable doubt but that it had to prove one last fact, namely, federal insurance as a prerequisite to conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.451" offset="14757721">The Illinois principle contention is that by adopting the Constitution of United States, the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment, the States didn't conceive and nobody has conceived that they were abdicating their right to try for and punish crimes of violence against persons and properties within their territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.204" offset="14920725">Should the Federal Government undertake to make the same acts criminal particularly when there's no suggestion that the Federal Government has preempted the field, and any such suggestion is explicitly disclaimed by Mr. Fisher in his argument in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.235" offset="15012885">So to hold, would be to hold that the Constitution was a compact by which the States have, in some manner, compromised or abridged or abdicated their power to punish such simple crimes of violence as robbery should the Federal Government prosecute in and earlier case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.174" offset="15136601">Now, Mr. Fisher raises other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.129" offset="15156454">He says that even if Illinois might retry this -- this petitioner and might be trying these crimes in general, due process is denied because federal officials were active in the prosecution and procurement of the conviction which is under review in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4428.864" offset="17715409">In the trial in Illinois, some of petitioner's witnesses were cross-examined as their testimony from the transcripts of the federal court proceedings in the usual manner, "Weren't you asked such and such a question and didn't you make such and such a reply?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4458.919" offset="17835572">The defendant sought to introduce evidence in the state court that he had been acquitted in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.599" offset="17878309">The trial judge in the state court refused to permit the jury in a state court to know the verdict in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.227" offset="17916865">And it's contended in the brief that that rule denies due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.735" offset="17946854">We say that that question raises only a question of evidence, it being the very well set of general rule that one jury is not to be told what another jury did with the same case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4505.557" offset="18022191">It's a -- generally speaking, one jury has never told what a former jury in that or any other court decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="4517.162" offset="18068584">Now, it is true that -- no, had -- had petitioner been convicted in the federal court instead of acquitted, the State couldn't have shown that conviction as proof of guilt in this case though they might have used it to impeach him if he testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4539.685" offset="18158655">But we say that that's outmost the question, a question of state law and not a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.616" offset="18186449">So to sum up Illinois' position in this case, we say, if Your Honors please, that the overwhelming consensus of opinion has been up until certiorari was granted in this case that conviction or acquittal in a federal court does not by a retrial in a state court for the same facts or vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.729" offset="18314867">We note in this case that proof of an additional fact, namely, the presence of federal insurance was required in the federal case, we say that if we can prosecute at all, we can prosecute with the full aid and even at the instance of federal prosecutors provided that no illicitly obtained evidence is used or other illicit means are used to prosecute the case, we can prosecute just as though there had been no federal trial and we say that no error in intervened in failure to tell the jury in the state court that petitioner had been acquitted in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4627.042" offset="18508069">By those considerations, we respectfully submit this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4699.738" offset="18798864">And if ordered liberty means anything, it means I can't think of anything more just orderly than to have relitigation of completed cases in which a final judgment has been entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.992" offset="18843899">Now, the case of Parker against McClure that Mr. Wines referred to is like so many cases both in this Court and other courts on this question that are said to be against us.</text>

            <text syncTime="4756.150" offset="19024562">It is a public service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.540" offset="19030100">Mr. Wines, I would like to say to you also that we appreciate the fair and earnest manner in which you have defended the rights of the people of your State and that -- that gentleman is without regard to the outcome of this case.</text>
