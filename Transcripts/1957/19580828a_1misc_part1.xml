            <text syncTime="152.578" offset="610220">petitioners, versus William G. Cooper et al, Members of the Board of Directors of the Little Rock Arkansas Independent School District, and Virgil T. Blossom, Superintendent of Schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.506" offset="661943">Mr. Marshall.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="177.511" stopTime="692.254">
            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="177.511" offset="710008">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.841" offset="727353">This afternoon's extraordinary session was necessitated because of the fact that the constitutional rights of the petitioners here, the Negro plaintiffs in the cases below, their right to remain attendance at a desegregated school in Central High School in Little Rock and this was pursuant to court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.807" offset="835187">I like to emphasize at the outset the rights we are seeking protection for are not rights that are in the abstract, but rights that have been determined not necessarily by the Brown decision, but you -- the Court will remember that in this case the District Court approved the plan of desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.379" offset="945424">The plaintiffs below appealed to the Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.057" offset="964127">It was affirmed, and court record also shows that in September of last year there were two applications for stay to Judge Davies sitting especially in the District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas and they were both denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.447" offset="1033718">So the rights we seek are rights that have been recognized by the federal courts and as such we believe that they are in a different category from a normal litigant in an injunction proceeding prior to judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.371" offset="1109473">But however the normal procedure in this case would have meant that the stay of judge Lemley's order would have been issued by Judge Lemley, but he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.231" offset="1172898">He refused and declined to stay the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.397" offset="1189512">The Court will remember that at the end of this past session of this Court, we filed a petitioner for certiorari, seeking to have this Court review Judge Lemley's decision without first going through the Court of Appeals under the special section that provides that that shall happen, if there is some extraordinary situation which we thought existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.573" offset="1290240">And this Court denied the petition for certiorari, and the case went back, rather we went back to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.489" offset="1325871">The Court of Appeals sat in extraordinary session and sat en banc, the entire court, and in short time decided the case, in unequivocal language that Judge Lemley's order was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.005" offset="1408000">I emphasize the language because I will need that in my argument later.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.620" offset="1438407">However, two days thereafter we having filed a motion for the mandate to issue forthwith, the respondent school board having filed a motion to stay the mandate, we arrived in this very extraordinary situation, I would like to call it anomaly in the law, of an order appealed from, reversed insofar as an opinion can and I have of course recognize it is judgments and not opinions to reversal orders, and then to have the stay issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.632" offset="1602456">And the truth of the matter is these entire proceedings, starting with the filing of the petition of the school board way back in February asking for time, the whole purpose of these proceedings is to get time.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.207" offset="1672777">The objective of the proceedings is that the Little Rock Schools be returned from desegregated to segregated status as of September school term.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.086" offset="1728261">The order having been declared in the opinion as being wrongfully issued the procedural device which is normal to stay the mandate of a Court of Appeals only for the purpose of preserving the record in the Court of Appeals so it can get up here that's the only purpose for it, but in this case the stay of the issuance of the mandate decided the merits of the case directly contrary to the opinion of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.738" offset="1858873">The opinion said that the school board was not entitled to a suspension of the integration plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.541" offset="1898162">The stay of the mandate said you don't have to act on this until after the school term begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.983" offset="1931912">At that time the school term was to begin on September 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.271" offset="1949048">This Court can take judicial notice that that has been postponed to September 8th, but at any rate the staying of the mandate would effectively mean that if this Court would wait until October, the school term would be in session and I believe anybody will agree that it's not good educational policy to transfer children in the middle of a school term.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.881" offset="2051448">So we have this strange situation in the law of a procedural device of staying a mandate actually ruling on the merits in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.459" offset="2105783">That point plus this additional point and that is that the Court certainly can take judicial notice of what is going on in the legislature in Arkansas today, it's quite obvious that anytime spent in delay in this matter will bring about not less litigation but more litigation and that is why and I think we are entitled to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.674" offset="2222602">We believe that this Court must not only and stay, vacate the stay of the eighth circuit, I mean the Court of Appeals for the eighth circuit, but I think that in the present posture of this litigation, in the very peculiar status that it's in, and the atmosphere that now exists in the State of Arkansas with the Governor and the legislature and everybody determined to set themselves up against the whole United States, that the only effective relief that this Court can give that will protect the rights of the petitioners here would be to stay the man -- I mean vacate the stay of issuance of the mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.922" offset="2411624">Two, to stay Judge Lemley's order, suspending the previous orders of the District Court, and as was done in the Lucy case for an entirely different reason, to order that the existing orders of Judge Miller, who originally heard the case and Judge Davies who heard it, sitting specially assigned last September, be reinstated and in full force in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.968" offset="2531788">A question immediately arises as to whether this Court has authority to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.091" offset="2552268">Well as was pointed out in many cases, the All Writs Statute for one gives authority and indeed the procedural statute on the staying of the mandate gives credence to our position, and if there is any exact authority that's needed, we take the flat position that the Lucy case says specifically that this Court has that authority and needs go no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.443" offset="2669714">I don't believe as might be argued that this Court cannot and should not go into the merits of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.471" offset="2709838">It tends to raise the question in my mind what do we mean by the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.275" offset="2733035">The merits in this case have already been decided by the stay and the stay is now being reviewed by this Court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="1055.645" offset="4222537">Yes sir with the theory that would see it worked out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.399" offset="4253571">With the permission of the Court, I would like to just in a measure, to go into some of the background of this case, because as we see it the factual -- the facts in this case are so clearly set out in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, that in our brief and now we don't think its necessary to go into too great detail, but there are one or two points that I think need emphasizing and that is that the record will show that with the exception of the one time that the School Board asked for affirmative relief when a white parent obtain judgment in a Chancery Court to which Governor Faubus and other people had testified and the Chancery judge ruled that the School Board should be enjoined from carrying out the plan which the District Court had approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.539" offset="4494106">The School Board did on that occasion go into Judge Davies and properly Judge Davies enjoined the enforcement of that state judgment, and that was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.094" offset="4552307">Well with the exception of that, the only relief that the School Board has asked from the District Court is postponement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.522" offset="4593998">They have asked for no relief in affirmative relief to help this thing along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.938" offset="4615732">That goes back from the two requests in September of last year and bear in mind that the petition in this case which is before you today, was asked for way back in February, it was around February that they gave up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.884" offset="4679471">That was when they asked for this relief and it sat there for a while until Chief Judge Gardner assigned Judge Lemley to hear it and the hearing took place in the early part of June.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.908" offset="4723566">So, on that basis it seems to us that as the government points out in its brief and as we point out in our brief, that there was an affirmative duty on the School Board to get help in this situation, and the only objection at all was that the community was opposed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.704" offset="4810815">And the other point that they rely on in their memorandum and in their brief, is that a stay of this will help and in the District Court, in the Court of Appeals and in the response that they filed to our petition, and up to the present day, with the exception of two points, one that Governor Faubus might not be in office two-and-a-half years from now and that certain statutes of Arkansas now being litigated might be decided within two-and-a-half years, with the exception of those points as of this minute, the School Board has not given anybody any information of what they propose to do in the two-and-a-half years while these rights are being suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.406" offset="5029616">And in the question of a stay or the vacation of a stay and in cases cited in our brief we point out that the law is quite similar between the two, especially the Virginia case and the Breswick case and a few others we cite in our brief, that there's got to be a showing of one the irreparable harm on one side as against that on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.758" offset="5127001">The record shows that these children will graduate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.548" offset="5150093">So far as matters now stand, if they are in segregated schools next year their rights are just gone, I mean that's the end of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.072" offset="5188232">On the other hand, the statute which affirmatively gives the right of the Court, 2101 (f), of any court to stay issuance of mandates, provides that the Court may if necessary require supersedes of some form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.113" offset="5288438">And again this case solely, because of the peculiar situation, the states is never required to give bond and so they're not even required to give and we have a complete change of status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.593" offset="5350296">When this case was heard, those children in the Central High School now seven, there were nine, one graduated, Ernest Green graduated, one Minnijean Brown was expelled, leaving seven, those seven were in an integrated school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.464" offset="5429812">They had been there for a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.418" offset="5441620">Under Judge Lemley's order, they are taken out, and that's going to change the status, there is a physical change of status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.688" offset="5474743">And they are taken out as of -- it would only be effective so far as they are concerned from the opening of the school, because school had been in recess, but that complete change of status must have some extraordinary reason to be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.303" offset="5537123">The normal procedure is to maintain the status quo, and I submit that Judge Lemley was the one that should have stayed an order, not the Court of Appeals to stay its order reversing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.930" offset="5587696">And we finally, we take the flat decision that on the merits of this case we are entitled to relief, not that we need to establish that point in order to get relief, but we take the position that the opinion of the Court of Appeals was so clear, that the respondents here had nothing that they could successfully bring to this Court, and in many of the rulings of this Court, in Chambers, that if taken into consideration, the possibility of whether or not you actually have a justiciable issue recognizable by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.138" offset="5756552">And the petitioners had no such case, and yet they can toy around with the situation, and effectively deny these rights by using procedural devices such a motion to stay.</text>

            <text syncTime="1603.051" offset="6412121">Our original petition for certiorari, when that was filed this Court said, you will remember that we have no doubt that the Court of Appeals will recognize the vital importance of the time element in this litigation, and that it will act upon the application for a stay or the appeal in ample time to permit arrangements to be made for the next school year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.892" offset="6515566">And on the basis of that language, which was a basis for denying our petition for certiorari, I think present developments in the eight -- the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and conditions as they exist in Arkansas would at least impel this Court to order that it be heard on its merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.406" offset="6601561">Now we have no authority as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.787" offset="6611069">We could file a petition for certiorari, but we considered it, and to be perfectly frank with the Court, we took the position that it had been done before, and that this Court could reconsider our petition filed in June, and order argument on it or could consider it right here and now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.421" offset="6709603">And I -- the only thing -- I believe that the way this case stands, there must be a definitive decision, and I use the two together, I mean it's bad English, but it's the best way I can do it, that there be no doubt in Arkansas that the orders of that District Court down there must be respected and cannot be suspended and cannot be interfered with by the legislature or anybody else.</text>

            <text syncTime="2618.236" offset="10472908">The stay in this case was really given on to the procedural statute which says that a stay can be granted for the purpose of petition in the Supreme Court, but nothing at all on the merits and I presume the merits weren't considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.668" offset="10526616">And so that at this -- at this stage of the litigation is the first time that the merits, and I use merits merely as to the merits as to whether or not an order is entitled to be stayed, that for the first time the merits of that are being considered for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.558" offset="10598191">And we take the position that when you balance these rights of these kids involved plus what this, this Court said in the Brown case, the public interest, meaning the public interest of the United States over against a school board's position that there are some people that don't want to let this thing go through then certainly the equities involved lean toward the protection of those constitutional rights rather than the postponement of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.357" offset="10725355">And I believe that I have to recognize that is an issue in this case and is expressed by the Court of Appeals, they said there is no problem about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.627" offset="10762449">They just cannot be surrender -- and they mentioned the case that I said before the Strutwear Knit case which is famous for the expression about handling bank robbers you, you don't close the banks you put the bank robbers in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.353" offset="10821381">And therefore it seems to me and I don't want to prolong the argument that we are entitled to both, at the same time it seems to me that the real justice of the case would not be required by going into either, but that either on our petition for cert originally filed or by some other procedural device that this Court be given an opportunity to pass on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.368" offset="10973414">As I said before petitioners are perfectly willing to argue the case on the merits even though we were successful insofar as opinion of the lower court was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.654" offset="11022524">The law I think of reading of the three briefs, our brief, the school board's brief and the government's brief, demonstrates that there is really no serious conflict of the law as to the authority of this Court to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.259" offset="11108937">There is a conflict between the school board as to whether this Court should act, and on that we think that the equities on the side of school children are such that the only relief that can be granted that will be effective will be for the decision on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3052.013" offset="12207961">To straighten out a few things that counsel for the NAACP may not have been aware of, your clerk called me several days ago, after taking with the clerk of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and finding that the record of that Court had been returned to Little Rock.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.071" offset="12304196">I located it, and mailed it here immediately and it is my information that the entire record from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals is here in your clerk's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.285" offset="12361038">That has attached to it three such typewritten volumes that each of about this size, which shows all of the testimony that was given in before Judge Lemley in approximately three-day hearing in his Court, in June.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.277" offset="12465006">In addition to that, there was a large packet as counsel has referred to, of various exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.070" offset="12496248">They were not identified each separately but were introduced as a packet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.877" offset="12523416">They were largely newspaper items which Judge Lemley took into consideration to show the confusion and turmoil and the position that this school board was put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.349" offset="12573362">I thought that might be helpful for the Court to know that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.212" offset="12592797">One other thing that I would like to mention in passing at the beginning, which I think counsel was somewhat confused on or uninformed on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.036" offset="12648072">At the time this School Board requested a temporary stay, purely temporary, before Judge Davies in September of 1957, the troops, National Guard had either been ordered out or it was known that they were to be ordered out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.648" offset="12738560">And at that time there was an injunction that had been ordered by the local Chancery Court, directing this School Board to do exactly opposite from what had been planned and what Judge Miller had ordered in August of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.520" offset="12822047">Now that was the purpose behind the School Board going into Court at that time and asking merely for a temporary delay, they did that for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.842" offset="12879308">In the first place they were caught in an untenable position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.934" offset="12903654">As a matter of fact they have been there continuously since then up to this very day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.378" offset="12933433">They also felt that under the circumstances with troops moving in and out of the city and perhaps strife and turmoil to follow, that the wise thing to do was for the Court to have an opportunity to tell it, the School Board, what it should do under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.718" offset="13030818">The School Board felt that a temporary, not the kind of delay that Judge Lemley had given over a long period of time, two-and-a-half years, but for that immediate situation, that it was necessary to get it clarified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.506" offset="13101976">A third reason for the School Board to go in at that particular time before Judge Davies, was that here they were ordered by two different courts, to do exactly opposite things, or at least partially opposite, and they felt on advice of counsel that it was advisable for them to show that there was no motive on their part of contempt of the federal court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.323" offset="13217228">Now, I think those are the reasons behind what has been referred to as the petition for delay of September 1957.</text>

            <text syncTime="4421.208" offset="17684793">It has been my limited experience, that it is not an easy matter to present a petition for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.101" offset="17716349">There are certain things that must be done and we are not as familiar with that as lawyers who practice here in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.704" offset="17746756">We would deplore being rushed into it to the extent of not being -- having time adequately to prepare.</text>
            <text syncTime="4446.821" offset="17787193">Now it seems that all the lawyers in this case are -- pretty well agreed and we won't dwell on that part of it, that this Court probably has the power to grant petitioners' motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4464.808" offset="17859187">Many instances can be cited both ways, not only of this Court but all appellate courts, of setting aside or upholding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4472.823" offset="17891265">The customary thing of course is for the Court that heard the case to exercise its judicial discretion in granting the stay or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.802" offset="17951138">Now it would be in our opinion an unusual procedure, although not unprecedented for this Court to vacate the stay of the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4502.901" offset="18011533">I don't think it would serve any useful purpose to dwell on the various cases in the various circuits as well as in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.663" offset="18046642">I think we're all in accord that there is power in this Court to do either one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4519.444" offset="18077675">Now unquestionably though the burden is on the petitioners that is at least my studied judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.053" offset="18124173">I think the very nature of the legal proceedings dictate that when a stay is granted by a Court the burden is on the side seeking to set that aside, and we feel that they have not met any such burden up to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4550.253" offset="18200973">As we see it each such case presents itself to every court, whether it's this Court or any other appellate court, with this rather simple but profound question, and that is should we as a court on motion pending on appeal or certiorari, summarily substitute our opinion for that of the lower court which heard the case and granted the stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4582.088" offset="18328346">With this Court sitting en banc, it may prove difficult for all the parties to eliminate arguing Judge Lemley's decision as against the point that is before this Court right now, the particular issue of setting aside the stay of the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.634" offset="18406504">And I agree with counsel that he's just spoken that such argument necessarily overlaps one into the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.152" offset="18444539">It's difficult to distinguish between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="4616.796" offset="18467109">However, we feel that even though such arguments become intertwined, that really the case, the issue before this Court as of now, insofar as these pleadings are concerned, is whether or not this Court is going to set aside the stay of the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.214" offset="18564807">Now I set forth in our response, the trial court after hearing evidence for three days found that under the conditions now existing in Little Rock and these findings, not a single finding of Judge Lemley was disturbed or questioned by the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.553" offset="18646204">As a matter of fact the Circuit Court of Appeals found everyone of those itself and so set them out in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4670.547" offset="18682149">But Judge Lemley found and also the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals found that it is impossible for the School Board of Little Rock to operate a school program for the 2,000 students at Central High School on an integrated basis at this time, and that unless the plan of desegregation is postponed for a reasonable length of time, that irreparable harm will be inflicted upon the students of both Negro and white race.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.090" offset="18816313">Now the broad issue of course in this case is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4709.592" offset="18838361">Can a court of equity postpone the enforcement of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights if the immediate enforcement thereof will deprive others, many others as a matter of fact, of their constitutional rights to an education in a free public school?</text>
            <text syncTime="4735.116" offset="18940447">The Little Rock Public School Board is composed of outstanding citizens of our community.</text>
            <text syncTime="4742.188" offset="18968660">There are two medical doctors on the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4745.959" offset="18983811">There is a civil engineer, graduate civil engineer, one of the large manufacturing concerns in our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.826" offset="19019233">There is a certified public accountant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4759.560" offset="19038145">There is a leading businessman of one of the large backing companies there, an official of that company, and the present President of the Little Rock School Board is a wise and experienced lawyer who has practiced there many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4777.671" offset="19110661">Those men are unpaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4780.201" offset="19120797">They are public servants.</text>
            <text syncTime="4782.205" offset="19128738">They have tried to do the best they could under as trying circumstances as any public servants have ever been faced with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4793.569" offset="19174191">Now when other boards of education were refusing to recognize the basic change that the Supreme Court had made in the law in the Brown decision, this Board was studying and formulating ways and means of complying.</text>
            <text syncTime="4811.426" offset="19245662">They knew it was not an easy task, but they were willing to do their best.</text>
            <text syncTime="4817.893" offset="19271471">These are men of high standing as I have said in their community.</text>
            <text syncTime="4825.240" offset="19300937">From bitter experience, however, they discovered that they could not operate a public school system under the existing climate in Little Rock as of this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.584" offset="19354331">Now they didn't anticipate all of the difficulty that has arisen and I dare say that many courts did not anticipate all of that difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4849.881" offset="19399471">But from bitter experience they discovered after some five or six months of operation, after troops had been in and out and still there, under different commanders that they could operate the school only with troops and yet they could not give an education with troops.</text>
            <text syncTime="4870.721" offset="19482854">They came to that, studied and serious conclusion on or about the later part of or about the 20th of February after they have been operating a full completely semester with troops in the halls and around the school building.</text>

            <text syncTime="4959.836" offset="19839269">It says among many trials of the people of Little Rock certainly not the least of them has been the way in the which the course of events has been suddenly reversed and reversed again by the various agencies of government and now they are to suffer more of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4981.695" offset="19926727">First there was the ruling of the Supreme Court that upset the old order in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.198" offset="19948774">To this change the local authorities in Little Rock and most of its people tried to adjust, but then all of a sudden they were confronted with troops sent by their governor to block integration and troops sent by their President to enforce integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.968" offset="20023798">Next there was a ruling by a federal district judge denying a stay and ordering integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.611" offset="20046367">This was followed by an order from another federal judge in the same district granting the people at times respite by postponing integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5020.839" offset="20083252">This week the federal circuit judge has once more reversed direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5025.005" offset="20099971">There is talk of another appeal to the Supreme Court of a special session of the legislature, all of which of course has come about in the last few days.</text>

            <text syncTime="5047.741" offset="20190877">But just the same the result has been that the people of Little Rock did not know from one day unto the next, under what order of society they must live, but found all change by which holder of what office wielded the moments power.</text>

            <text syncTime="5203.733" offset="20814890">These presentations were informative and helpful and in its consideration of the complexities arising from the transition to a system public -- of public education free of racial discrimination, full implementation of these constitutional principles may require solution of varied local school problems, because of their proximity to local conditions and the need for further hearings the courts which originally heard these cases can best perform this judicial appraisal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5242.472" offset="20969848">Accordingly, we believe it's appropriate to remand those cases to those courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5249.712" offset="20998792">In fashioning and effectuating the decrees the courts will be guided by equitable principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.528" offset="21034109">Traditionally equity has been characterized by a practical flexibility in shaping its remedies and by a facility for adjusting and reconciling public and private needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5273.443" offset="21093669">These cases call for the exercise of these traditional attributes of equity power.</text>
            <text syncTime="5280.988" offset="21123866">By giving weight to these public and private considerations, the courts will require that the defendants make a prompt and reasonable start towards the compliance with our May 17th 1954 ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="5294.493" offset="21177887">Once such a start has been made the courts may find that additional time is necessary to carry out the ruling in an effective manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5309.070" offset="21236193">When we look at this entire problem, we recognize that two-and-a-half years, historically is a very short time or perhaps any other period of time and I know of no better way at least it was most impressive on Judge Lemley.</text>
            <text syncTime="5341.673" offset="21366596">it was impressive on other people when Mr. Blossom, the School Board Superintendent, who has studied this thing and has been on his heart as well as the hearts of the school board members more than anyone else and has been his major responsibility in asking him in the lower court what he found, and this is in the record that is now before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5375.287" offset="21501074">He was asked the question whether he had read the Supreme Court decision, these men were earnestly trying to carry out the orders of the Federal Court as they saw it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.294" offset="21549140">But their function was also to maintain a public education system in Little Rock, and I will say I think in all fairness to those men that that probably was their primary object and consideration and duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5407.952" offset="21631791">But Mr. Blossom testified in studying this problem just what did it mean, what did deliberate speed mean in one locality as against another, what did it mean in this particular serious problem that has confronted not just Little Rock but the entire nation and here in substance was his testimony that portion of it verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5437.430" offset="21749656">We ask him whether he had given consideration to this time element when they finally filed the petition before Judge Lemley for a two-and-a-half year delay and he said very definitely, we have given great consideration to it in this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5456.538" offset="21826142">We are dealing with something that is very important and very dear to the hearts of many people on both sides of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5464.823" offset="21859265">We took into account the effect as far as time and other cultural pattern changes in our society were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.471" offset="21889881">We try to look into history to see what it would teach us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5476.299" offset="21905136">We tried to analyze the situation of the Negro and his march to civil rights in this community.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.653" offset="21934602">Then he was asked the question as whether he considered the term delivery speeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5488.975" offset="21955814">His answer was, “Yes sir, very material.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5492.673" offset="21970651">The Negro race as a race came to this country in 1619.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.735" offset="21990922">They came in chains as slaves.</text>
            <text syncTime="5500.698" offset="22002730">They stayed in that and as far as I could study it, you would class that as the first period in the history of the United States and they stayed from 1619 until 1865, nearly two-and-three-quarter century and that is one period in their march for civil rights and their development.</text>
            <text syncTime="5519.816" offset="22079216">The second period came in 1865 and they stayed in this second period until 1896, the decision of Plessy versus Ferguson.</text>
            <text syncTime="5529.139" offset="22116519">That is 31 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5531.732" offset="22126864">Now in this period they had their freedom, they did not have the economic or political or any other type of positions to any extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5540.078" offset="22160300">Then coming out of that period into what I could call the third one from 1896 to 1954 and I would just label that separate but equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5550.900" offset="22203559">Now they stayed in that 58 years and then you look at the problem and the complexities in this thing and recognize that many separate but equally -- is in no way a reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.503" offset="22257998">In many places in the South land, but in Little Rock Arkansas they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="5571.776" offset="22287047">“I am not arguing the separate but equal philosophy,” Mr. Blossom continued, “I am trying to state that history tells us in terms of two-and-a-half year request for delay that this is the third period and we account for the fact that there are three periods, one taking nearly three centuries, another 31 years and another 58 years and recognizing that there is one group that says we are going to have it all now and another that says we are never going to have it, you put the horns of the dilemma in the proper perspective with the school board right in the middle and it is a difficult thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5611.567" offset="22446184">And then you come to May 17 1954 and we look at it today that was June 4, '58 and you compare that period of time as compared to either of the three previous periods I have outlined and you wonder how fast in terms of history, can anyone expect a change in cultural pattern.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.579" offset="22546286">Following that Mr. Blossom went into some detail and as did the President of the School board as to what could be done in two-and-a-half years and that is in the record and I respectfully disagree with the implication left by opposing counsel that nothing was to be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="5693.015" offset="22771984">It basically is simply this Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5696.267" offset="22785045">In the first place they felt that starting at mid-semester after organization was completed during the first semester was wise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5706.127" offset="22824438">That would put it at the middle of a term.</text>
            <text syncTime="5709.371" offset="22837394">Their reasoning simply was this, that your PTA organizations perhaps other organizations were and the school itself was then in a better organized position than it was after a summer recess of three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="5725.164" offset="22900611">The other thing was simply this and we are firmly convinced of this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5732.587" offset="22930286">In Little Rock as well as throughout the south and in other places where problem has arisen, the great mass of people are not law violators as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="5746.933" offset="22987651">They are not people who form mobs, they are not people who defy the law, but we submit in this school board determined that they were entitled to know what the law was and as long as editorialist, popular editorialist in our community were saying that this was not the law of the land and if there were ways to get around it and one court was saying one thing and another court was saying another, and there were laws on the state statute books of Arkansas as well as other states throughout the south, diametrically opposed as some people argued, some of them could be reconciled, some of them could not with the decision in the Brown case, but it left the people of our community as well as the people of many communities in actual doubt as to what the law was and on question to the people in our part of the country, wanted to believe that this thing could take a long time or be circumvented entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5813.218" offset="23252846">They wanted to believe that, but it is our firm opinion and it is the opinion of this school board and that was the main consideration given when they finally decided on a two-and-a-half year request that in that period of time perhaps as we pointed in our response a national policy could definitely be established, that laws could be tested so that the people would know, the people who want to obey the final word.</text>
            <text syncTime="5847.225" offset="23388891">Now that was the reason and very candidly Mr. Blossom ended up by testifying and I am sure this was the thinking of every member of the school board as well that we don't know that two-and-a-half years will do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5862.500" offset="23449913">You may be able to do it one year, you might do it in a year-and-a-half, maybe two-and-a-half is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="5868.995" offset="23475931">He doesn't know but the courts have said that the first consideration of this problem shall be dealt with by the school boards, it is their primary function, as a matter of fact this Court I believe have said it just that way, if not certainly all the appellate courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="5943.104" offset="23772369">Why isn't that a national policy, and why hasn't that national policy, why wasn't that enforced in Little Rock, in the Little Rock district when the school board submitted a plan after mature consideration, after listing public support on its behalf submitted it to the court where it was contested and the court said, yes this satisfies the policy laid down the second in the Brown and Allen decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5970.898" offset="23883546">Why isn't that deference to local situation in the enforcement of what was laid down a national policy, national policy doesn't mean the same thing must take place in Little Rock, Arkansas as in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, something yes, but not for this kind of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5989.492" offset="23957943">And there was a national policy and the federal courts recognized it.</text>
