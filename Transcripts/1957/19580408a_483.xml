            <label>Mr. Attorney General</label>
            <text syncTime="33.035" offset="132075">These cases involved the same constitutional provision, Article 20, Section 19 of the California Constitution and Revenue and Taxation Code Section 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.067" offset="180245">The issues in these cases are exactly the same as the preceding cases with the exception that it does not involve a question of freedom of religion or establishment of religion nor is there an organizational question involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.761" offset="247014">We are dealing with a privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.933" offset="259657">There is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.967" offset="267807">We aren't saying that there is a right to an exemption and even historically, we will not find the same granting of exemption for veterans in this area as it has been granted to churches.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.635" offset="330501">I like to suggest that there's a classification -- distinction that should be made between exemptions, hence, they are given and when you take an exemption away.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.011" offset="375954">For example, it will not be proper, it would seem to me, to grant an exemption of any kind to redheads, Republicans or adulterers.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.226" offset="416810">But if you grant exemptions to the general public, it may be bad and it would be bad to take away exemptions or to exclude from exemptions in general, redheads, churches with red-headed ministers or Republicans or adulterers.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.303" offset="489117">Now, I am basing my argument on a broader scale than the preceding counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.112" offset="524434">I contend that we do have an issue, the constitutional amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.958" offset="547736">We have it in issue for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.673" offset="558602">We have it in issue because the State Supreme Court construed it, interpret it and in its findings on free speech question, it was talking about the constitutional amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.652" offset="610534">We have it in issue because the State Supreme Court said it was self-executing.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.961" offset="627775">It was mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.880" offset="631432">It was prohibitory.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.295" offset="637179">It applied to all exemptions in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.299" offset="649195">And it -- and it said that Revenue and Taxation Code Section 32 was merely a procedural device.</text>

            <text syncTime="222.930" offset="891716">But in determining the validity of this and the purpose, we have to look at two purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.577" offset="926302">One, the purpose of the exemption, it's the Article 20, the constitutional amendment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.811" offset="951171">And then secondly, we have to consider the purposes of all exemptions and see whether there is a broad overall purpose.</text>
