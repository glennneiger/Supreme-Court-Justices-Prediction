            <text syncTime="1268.415" offset="5073607">There was no duty on the part of the shipowner to tear this structure down at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.565" offset="5098162">It was customarily done at sea solely because it's part of the squaring up of the ship and has to do with the ship and its own sailors and not any duty towards the stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.059" offset="5144137">And with -- in making a short run from New York to Boston if it left those structures there, that beyond -- that was in violation of no duty to anyone other the seaman if a seaman might have gotten hurt in the process of cleaning it up during the course of the voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.476" offset="5209861">But the jury found that this structure, as it arrived in Boston was the very same structure that had been created by the third-party defendant stevedore at New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="1331.278" offset="5325009">Stevedore was in charge of the men.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.684" offset="5338697">They were the specialist at discharging the ship and in supervising the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.634" offset="5362521">They expressly contracted to do this work properly, with the proper supervision and equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.964" offset="5391778">The -- the piece of equipment which caused this man's injury was no part of the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.430" offset="5413616">The jury verdict precludes any finding to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.781" offset="5431066">So the ship was found to be seaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.018" offset="5440052">And I think the definition of seaworthiness given by the district judge is -- is fair enough on that score.</text>

            <text syncTime="1392.956" offset="5571814">The United States appears amicus curiae in this case because of its great importance to the Government as one of the principle operators of the merchant marine and additionally, as responsible for the subvention of the merchant marine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.419" offset="5669616">Any increase in cost of the operating of ships falls upon the Government to a greater or less extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.693" offset="5714756">And accordingly, we are interested not only as the largest customer of contracting stevedores, but also as those who are responsible for supporting and subventioning other customers of contracting stevedores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.668" offset="5794586">Now, this if the Court please, in the second phase which is the phase which is before this Court today is a suit by the customer, the ship who hired a professional stevedoring contractor to stevedore its vessel in a skillful and proper fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.298" offset="5901166">In other words, it is a claim of the client against the expert of the customer against the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.907" offset="5939618">The basis of the claim is that by reason of a breach of the contact by the contracting stevedore to do the work in a proper fashion, one of the contracting stevedores own employees was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.115" offset="6008372">That employee recovered a judgment against the ship on account we maintain of ultimately the negligence of the contracting stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.806" offset="6071171">And the ship having paid for that brings this suit to obtain reimbursement of the money it was required to pay out as a result of the contracting stevedore's breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.021" offset="6131984">And accordingly we say, the concepts of primary and secondary fault have nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.674" offset="6162599">The question here is purely one of the law of contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.488" offset="6185900">The ship had a contract to have the work done properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.341" offset="6205336">The contractor breached that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.686" offset="6222681">Now, I would like to look for a moment at the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.746" offset="6246922">Now, Mr. Connolly, the injured longshoreman who got hit on the head with the board has been paid off some $50,000 odd and this suit is by the ship who paid him pursuant to the judgment to be reimbursed that amount because it had to pay it as a result of the breach of contract of its professional contracting stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.749" offset="6346919">Now, the facts are quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.216" offset="6360816">The ship got into New York Harbor on the 25th day of January.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.771" offset="6387043">At that time, there was a deck load on and they had to begin first to take the deck load of lumber off and then to go into the holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.169" offset="6416614">And when I assumed they got the deck load off, at that point, the winch man erected in New York shelters to keep the weather off of him, the snow and the rain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.727" offset="6478890">Those shelters which were erected by the winch man, employees of the contracting stevedore for their own convenience were flimsy-like structures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.352" offset="6529358">They're made out of dunnage, hard boards that are left around loose and they put over them tarpaulins in order to keep off the weather.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.692" offset="6566766">Now, they erected them some time subsequent to the 25th day of January.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.178" offset="6592679">The vessel was done discharging at New York on the 30th day of January.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.452" offset="6617757">So on the 30th day of January, she put to sea, at that time ordinarily, the longshoreman would have been expected to take away the stevedore's tarpaulins from this flimsy hatch shelter that they had here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.884" offset="6679510">But whether they did or not, when the vessel arrived at Boston, the following day, that's one day later, the shelter, the hatch shelter was still in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.291" offset="6737084">It was visible whether there were one or two tarpaulins over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.842" offset="6755265">It's doubtful under the testimony in the record whether it could be certain and that's of course important because it was light loose dunnage placed on the top of the second tarpaulin which was blown off by the wind and precipitated into the hold hitting Mr. Connolly, the injured man, on the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.421" offset="6833633">Now -- so, we have a situation that the professional contractor built this flimsy structure for his own purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.254" offset="6872921">It's a hindrance to the ship and when the ship gets ready to go to sea, it should take it off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.548" offset="6890162">As Mr. Symmers has explained, it owes that duty to its seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.210" offset="6908761">When they got into Boston, the ship's personnel say that the shelter was gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.514" offset="6938018">The stevedore contractor's personnel say the shelter was still there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.280" offset="6961110">They say that they ordinarily in accordance with the custom of the trade, the agreement of parties go aboard with hammer and nails and they erect such a structure but they didn't have to do it this time because there was one up there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.285" offset="7013042">Now, once more, I want to remind the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.988" offset="7035925">The ship employs the professional expert stevedore to do the job properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.112" offset="7064346">Now, if there was some kind of conjuries of boards amounting to a hatch shelter that for one day had been in the possession of the vessel while it was at sea and had been blown about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.129" offset="7116487">Proper stevedoring practice and indeed ordinary common sense would indicate that that should have been inspected by the professionals who were going aboard to stevedore the vessel and who would have to erect their own flimsy structure if they hadn't found the remains of an old one there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.271" offset="7197048">The record however shows that they didn't do a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.745" offset="7210945">They did not inspect the hatch shelter that was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.572" offset="7230276">They paid no attention to it and they went on stevedoring using this hatch shelter which the company had built at New York and which had been in the possession of the ship just one day at sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.881" offset="7287432">And after five days of using the structure during which again the record is clear, they failed absolutely to make the customary inspections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.604" offset="7334348">Indeed, I think common sense dictates that a structure of this sort should be inspected two or three times a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.228" offset="7364859">The winch drivers themselves who testified for the plaintiff said that matters might be dislodged from it by wind or by the vibration of the winches in operating and that it was most important that it be secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.055" offset="7428180">Now, because they say that the ship had permitted the structure to remain aboard while it put to sea and came in, they are excuse from the professional duty of inspecting that structure when -- before they started to use it and through the whole of five days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.288" offset="7537058">Now, if the Court please, it seems to me it makes a great deal of difference in this case as to whether the accident happens a few hours after the longshoreman come along or as in this case five days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.646" offset="7586482">We believe that when a ship hires a contracting stevedore, it's entitled to have the hatch shelters or any other parts inspected immediately before they begin to use them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.558" offset="7646145">But we don't have to worry with that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.106" offset="7656385">They had five days during which there should have been 15 inspections in all probability and none were made until after.</text>

            <text syncTime="1927.103" offset="7708317">If they were an integral part of the ship, the situation might very well be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.907" offset="7727543">But of course not only are we precluded by such a judgment as a matter of common sense but the finding of the jury was in respect of the instructions on unseaworthiness that the hatch shelter was not impertinent to the ship.So, we have no such trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.468" offset="7801835">However, I would point out to Your Honor that even it had been a part of the ship such as a hatch beam with the defective locking device or anything of that sort, it is well settled under the decisions that the professional contracting stevedore, the expert which his hired by the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.774" offset="7875082">Now remember, the ship's personnel go ashore leaving only a couple of men around to take care of the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.775" offset="7895040">They don't do anything about the stevedoring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.337" offset="7905280">The professional stevedore is supposed to inspect and if things are not in order, he's supposed to stop work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.697" offset="7930776">And if it's a job that the ship should do to put them in proper order then the work stops and the time is running against the ship until the ship gets around to fix it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.864" offset="7967451">Now, that's exactly what wasn't done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.918" offset="7979572">In other words, this is the old familiar pattern that the contractor took the money and didn't do the job right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.851" offset="8015308">Now, I'd like to say a word about this question, about intervening acts of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.984" offset="8035892">The Second Circuit by a very distinguished judge, Judge Waterman, thought that the failure of the ship to remove the hatch shelter was an intervening act of negligence insolating, I take it, the liability of the contractor for having built a flimsy hatch structure but by the same token, the failure of the contractor to perform its proper professional duty to inspect the shelter before working.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.574" offset="8186253">And during the course of the work for five days was an intervening act of negligence which should in turn insolate the situation there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.088" offset="8228258">But actually, this conception of intervening acts of negligence is not appropriate to a case which involves contract rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.018" offset="8263993">In other words, the question we have here is when the ship allowed the flimsy structure to remain aboard when it put to sea and came in to Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.771" offset="8331076">Did it breach its contract to the contracting stevedore?</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.454" offset="8357721">Was there an agreement by the ship that it would for the benefit of the contracting stevedore remove the hatch shelter?Of course, the answer is, how could it be?</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.362" offset="8417384">To the extent that it was left there, it put the contracting stevedore in the position that there were the remains of a hatch structure, of a hatch shelter which it could refurbish and renew and put in shape with less trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.494" offset="8485930">There's certainly between the ship and a professional contractor skilled in the art could be no doubt that there was no representation by the ship that this flimsy structure hadn't been withstanding the high seas and winds in the passage from New York to Boston.</text>

            <text syncTime="2161.401" offset="8645590">That's why we don't think it makes any difference whether there was one or two contracts, whether the same stevedore operated at New York or Boston or any of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.190" offset="8688744">The question is, the stevedores at Boston were hired to do a proper job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.394" offset="8713509">When they got aboard, there -- there was the remains of a flimsy hatch shelter there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.606" offset="8742348">It was their duty to refurbish that, to inspect it because it was there for their purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.368" offset="8765440">We make conjecture that the reason it was left there is very likely because it was -- was the same stevedore in both places and it saved the people doing work in the second port.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.845" offset="8819357">Idle speculation but it's the most logical explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.417" offset="8833567">Now, in other words, had it been some similar flimsy structure there and a new stevedore had come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.938" offset="8879752">The new stevedore would owe the ship the same duty of professional skill in here to look after it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.346" offset="8905352">And as I've said to Your Honor, even if it had been a part of the ship as long as it was susceptible of discovery by inspection, there could be no doubt about the professional contractor's duty to his customer to see that it was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.196" offset="8980689">Now, in the brief of the contractor, a great deal is made to the fact that it was difficult to detect that there was trouble and insufficiency in the construction of the shelter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.189" offset="9036696">Now, that's errant nonsense because we find that after Mr. Connolly was hit on the head by a board, and the boards by the way were one inch by eight, about three and a half to five feet long, so it's little light dunnage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.451" offset="9097718">After that, one of the winch drivers simply skipped up on top the winch and being up that high, he could see up over the top of the shelter which was seven foot high and he was able to say to his partner that, "Now, this is an improper way to put a hatch shelter together."</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.616" offset="9198446">The second tarpaulin isn't secured at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.708" offset="9210776">They just laid it across and put two or three boards on top of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.763" offset="9231047">Now, that they could have found by similarly getting up on the hatch and taking on the winch and taking a look, the day the vessel came in to port.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.219" offset="9272842">It is to my mind the most abominable and shocking violation of a professional duty on the part of a contractor to its customer that has come before the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.866" offset="9315370">Most of these cases involve something quite latent and difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.888" offset="9339507">And you might feel some sympathy for the contractor even though he was a professional in having his men detect what's wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.046" offset="9376183">But this was the most obvious matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.409" offset="9385587">Nothing except the claimed breach of the contractor's duty to his customer ship could possibly have permitted this to come about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.112" offset="9424353">I think frankly it is a shocking thing that there was no criminal prosecution for the negligence in failing to inspect this matter daily so that Mr. Connolly was hit on the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.250" offset="9480986">So now, that is the very crux of the case, not that it was erected by the same stevedore contractor in New York but that after it had been a -- but a single day in the possession of the ship, the new stevedore contractor, because it's a different group of men even though it's the same company, the new stevedore contractor comes aboard and he doesn't do what he's paid for doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.039" offset="9600104">Now, we in our brief have set forth at great length the considerations of why it's necessary to have a breach of contract by the customer before the customer is deprived of his right to recover against the contractor who doesn't do the job he's paid for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.640" offset="9706475">Now here, there can be no question that there was no breach of contract subsequent to the breach of contract by the contracting stevedore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.285" offset="9761123">There is nothing in the testimony anywhere that suggests that the ship did anything to render the hatch shelter less secure once the stevedore contractor came aboard and started working.And that is the only kind of testimony we believe which would permit a denial of a judgment for reimbursement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3664.774" offset="14659082">We had -- I represent the stevedoring contractor and we have two transactions here, one in New York, where we unloaded some of the lumber from the ship, and one in Boston, where we completed the unloading.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.485" offset="14717910">And Mr. Symmers who represent the ship claims that we are liable to indemnify him for negligence or breach of contract in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.256" offset="14756989">And the United States Government says that we should indemnify the ship because of breach of contract which occurred in Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.776" offset="14783007">I'd like to take -- take it from the New York first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.476" offset="14801816">When the ship came into New York, it had a load of lumber which we started to unload.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.651" offset="14826580">The evidence which sustains the inference that we erected this shelter over -- over the winches is evidence given by the plaintiff's witnesses and by the ship itself that there was an invariable custom in every harbor in New York that longshoremen erected those shelters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.428" offset="14909649">And that as soon as the work was done, the ship's personnel removed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.917" offset="14931592">When the contract was drawn between the ship and the stevedore that -- that custom was well-known to both sides and they must have -- we must presume that the -- the contract was made in full knowledge that that condition existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.723" offset="14998883">Now, the ship of course denied that there were any shelters on the decks when it came into Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.303" offset="15029185">They swore that there were -- the witnesses swore there were not -- no shelters there that they would have been guilty of gross negligence if they had allowed the shelters to stay on deck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.630" offset="15074429">The ship argues that they didn't owe us any duty to remove the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.473" offset="15097835">But if that were so, we would still be responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.945" offset="15111732">The were temporary shelters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.165" offset="15116643">We'll be responsible for their condition if they had no duty to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.520" offset="15130018">We'd still be responsible if they caused injury to their seamen or to their -- to anybody on the deck until they were removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.944" offset="15155722">There's the -- we lost control of the shelters and I would think that under any reasonable interpretation, the ship owed us the obligation under this custom to remove those shelters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.662" offset="15206609">And on the basis of that intervening negligence and that intervening if you might call it breach of their implied warranty to the implied agreement that they would remove those shelters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.317" offset="15249241">The trial judge after the jury had returned the verdict holding that the ship was liable, the trial judge directed a verdict in favor of us on the indemnity claim.</text>
