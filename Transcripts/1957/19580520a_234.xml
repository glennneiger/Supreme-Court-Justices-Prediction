            <text syncTime="19.548" offset="78158">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of -- for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.125" offset="104490">The review of the judgment of that court in denying enforcement of certain subpoenas duces tecum issued in the course of a representation proceeding under the Section 9 of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.582" offset="170318">Section 11 (1) of the Act provides that the Board shall issue subpoenas forthwith upon the application of any party to the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.272" offset="220996">The section further provides that the person subpoenaed may contest the validity of the subpoena by filing a petition to revoke with the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.485" offset="269897">And the Board shall revoke the subpoena if in its opinion the evidence sought is irrelevant to the subpoena, does not describe it with sufficient particularity.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.199" offset="316709">Now, by regulation, the Board has provided that whereas here, a subpoena is returnable at a hearing, the petition to revoke shall be filed with and ruled on in the first instance by the hearing officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.407" offset="389538">His ruling is in turn subject to review by the Board itself under a special appeal procedure which I will describe in detail later.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.542" offset="434155">The question presented is whether this Board regulation is authorized by the statute or a stated otherwise, thus Section 11 (1) require the Board alone to rule on petitions to revoke subpoenas or may the Board authorize the hearing officer to make the initial ruling on such petition pursuant to this procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.171" offset="668630">The party makes out the -- the case that he has for offsetting the hearing officer and that question goes to the Board and if the Board determines that a substantial question is presented as to the correctness of the hearing officer's ruling, it will grant the special appeal, consider the subpoena question and upset the hearing officer if need be.</text>

            <text syncTime="234.028" offset="936020">Yes, Your Honor as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.207" offset="956813">Now, the same question is -- is presented in the case which follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.435" offset="981682">However, there, the subpoenas were issued in connection with an unfair labor practice proceeding and we believe that the Administrative Procedure Act furnishes an additional source or authority for the Board's procedure in such proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.362" offset="1041345">Now, briefly here, the underlying facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.249" offset="1060989">In November of 1955, a union, the retail clerks filed the petition with the Board's regional office for a representation election among the employees at a retail jewelry store in Miami, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.097" offset="1120340">At the hearing, the employer moved to dismiss on the ground that the business of the store did not satisfy the Board's jurisdictional yardsticks for the assertion of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.587" offset="1166315">However, the store refused to furnish any information to substantiate that contention whereupon the hearing was adjourned for the purpose of securing the information by subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.340" offset="1221277">Five subpoenas deces tecum and one testimonial subpoena, the validity of which is not an issue here, were, thereupon, issued and served.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.640" offset="1266521">They were issued to the store where the union was claiming representation rights and to three other stores allegedly part of the same intrastate chain, because under the Board's jurisdictional yardsticks, jurisdiction will be asserted over an intrastate retail store if its out of state purchases meet a certain figure and even if the purchases of the particular store do not satisfy the standard if the store is part of a chain and the total purchases of the stores is in the chain meet the figure then jurisdiction will be asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.241" offset="1424927">So that the subpoenas here requested, merely, sufficient information to ascertain whether or not the Board's chain store standard was met.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.766" offset="1474978">They were issued in accordance with the procedures similar to that followed under the federal rules of civil procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.679" offset="1506638">That is, the Board attorney assigned to the case made application to the regional director setting forth the person to be subpoenaed and the information sought and the regional director issued the attorney blank subpoenas bearing the seal of the Board and the facsimile signature of a Board member and were filled-in by the attorney and served.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.648" offset="1614576">Now, upon service of the subpoenas, the respondents filed petitions to revoke the subpoena alleging that they were burdensome and has not been properly issued which petitions were addressed to and filed with the Board in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.238" offset="1696914">And copies were sent to the hearing officer in Miami.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.408" offset="1713528">The executive secretary of the Board returned the petitions calling respondents' attention to the provision of the Board's rules herein issue which requires that these petitions be filed with the hearing officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.756" offset="1770998">The hearing officer then fixed a date for respondents to file briefs and argue orally in support of the petitions which respondents declined to avail themselves of and the hearing officer proceeded to deny the petitions to revoke on the ground that they presented no substantial issue as to the validity of the subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.923" offset="1859605">And when the hearing was reconvened, respondents appeared through counsel and indicated they would not comply with the subpoenas, whereupon, pursuant to Section 11 (2) of the Act the Board then instituted proceedings to enforce the subpoenas in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.924" offset="1935673">The District Court denied enforcement of the subpoenas on the ground that they were unreasonable and oppressive and were invalidly issued and that the regional director was not a party to the proceeding entitled to utilize the subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.727" offset="2002860">On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, agreed that the subpoena should not be enforced but for a different reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.030" offset="2040059">The court was of the views that this Board procedure or ruling on this petition to revoke in the first instance by the hearing officer, constituted an unauthorized delegation of authority to the hearing officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.519" offset="2110067">And since the Board itself had not passed on respondents' petitions to revoke, the suit in the Court's view was thus premature and could not be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.632" offset="2162521">Now, the Board's position is a two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.443" offset="2181747">We believe, first of all, that properly understood, the Board's procedure for revocation of subpoenas does not present a delegation problem at all and that the Board itself retains the power of final decision through this appeal procedure which I've indicated at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.331" offset="2277251">In the alternative, however, we submit that even if the Board's procedure were viewed as entailing a delegation of Board authority with the hearing officer, the Act does not preclude such delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.845" offset="2379337">Now, I've indicated briefly that under this procedure, the Board requires that the petition to revoke first be filed with the hearing officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.730" offset="2426880">Now, in an unfair labor practice, this hearing officer is a trial examiner with the independent status conferred by the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.244" offset="2464914">That's the situation in the case which follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.346" offset="2481319">In a representation case, such as we have here, he is a field examiner or attorney under staff of the regional office.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.914" offset="2515592">The reason for the difference is that a representation case is essentially an investigation and not -- not necessary a type of proceeding and is exempt from the hearing requirements of the APA.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.378" offset="2585496">In such cases, the Board is thus free, not restricted to the panel of hearing officers setup under that Act and can utilize other qualified personnel for the hearing officer function.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.237" offset="2648921">However, apart from the fact that the hearing officer in the -- our case does not make recommendations to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.593" offset="2694269">His function at the hearing is otherwise is responsible as that of a trial examiner in an unfair labor practice case.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.826" offset="2727288">He may call on and examine witnesses, rule on the admissibility of evidence, regulate the course of the hearing and ensure that it's his job to see that a full and complete record is developed for the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.866" offset="2799386">Now, if a party is dissatisfied with the hearing officer's action on the petition to revoke, the Board's procedure as I indicated at the outset affords the party an opportunity to apply to the Board for permission to appeal specially and if a substantial question is presented, the Board will entertain the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.225" offset="2896875">Moreover, there is opportunity when the case is before the Board for final decision to obtain Board review of the subpoena question.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.642" offset="2942537">Now, of course, that does not afford an adequate remedy in the situation where the hearing officer has denied the petition to revoke but where he grants a petition to revoke the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.558" offset="2998230">And the party aggrieved is the person requesting the subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.756" offset="3019024">He is afforded an opportunity to obtain Board review in regress of that situation when the case comes before the Board for final decision because the board can as it has in such cases ordered the hearing reopened should it find that the evidence denied to the individual was material.</text>

            <text syncTime="858.002" offset="3431967">Under the Wagner Act, however, the subpoena procedure was a one-step one rather than a two-step one and the decisional judgement was exercised at the stage of determining whether the subpoena should issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.976" offset="3487869">Whereas, under Taft-Hartley, the issuance is automatic and the judgment is deferred to the petition to revoke stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.650" offset="3522560">But apart from that difference, the Board's rules, since the earliest Wagner Act days, provided for the same method of having the hearing officer initially rule on the propriety of the subpoena.</text>

            <text syncTime="2081.380" offset="8325433">Now, its report was published to the Senate document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.482" offset="8337868">This has been in the Board's rules since as far a back as 1939 and in Taft-Hartley, when Congress got around to amending the Act, it looked at the subpoena provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.499" offset="8397949">And although there is no indication that it discussed this particular problem, it -- for the House Bill proposed to make some changes in the sense of depriving the Board of the use of subpoenas prior to hearings in unfair labor practice and appoints cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.775" offset="8483004">And they provided for this step procedure and then when the -- the Senate Bill proposed no change in the Wagner Act language and then when it emerged from conference, the only thing that they did was to adopt the petition to revoke a procedure, the House Bill rejecting the elimination of the use of subpoenas prior to hearing in unfair labor practice cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.848" offset="8587389">And Senator Taft said, the only change that we're making in existing law, insofar as subpoenas are concerned is to convert it from a one-step into a two-step procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.328" offset="8649247">Now, granted that you don't have a specific dealing with -- with this -- this problem, we certainly do have a situation where Congress was looking into the Board's subpoena procedures and the only thing that they emerged with is a change which would convert it from a one-step into a two-step procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2284.357" offset="9137424">It might be well to take just a moment to fill in some things in the beginning of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.438" offset="9161665">The National Labor Relations Board entertained their petition against one corporation in Miami of a chain of intrastate stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.361" offset="9209417">This corporation appeared at the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.017" offset="9228016">It filed as a counsel for the Board has stated a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.442" offset="9257691">It filed also with that a sworn affidavit setting up in full the business of that corporation and showing that that corporation was not subject to the National Labor Relations Board's jurisdiction as it was then fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.494" offset="9325923">The Board then went out and brought in three or four corporations, whose employees had nothing to do with this case in order to attempt to prove jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.049" offset="9364167">Then the subpoenas were issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.033" offset="9372108">And those subpoenas require that these corporations bring for an entire year all of their records into the hearing, covering every sale and every purchase between the corporations for an entire year in other words, the complete business of the corporations for a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.723" offset="9458834">In the answer in the District Court, the respondents stated and it has never been contradicted that it would have taken at least eight weeks to get this data up for the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.675" offset="9514632">Consequently, the corporation refused to abide by the subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.937" offset="9531664">One of the principal reasons was that they were oppressed -- oppressing the non-reasonable and the District Court so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.162" offset="9564578">There was some statement made with the hearing officer offered to permit counsel to -- to have oral argument and to file a brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.016" offset="9596029">That's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.511" offset="9601985">But the position of the respondents has always been that the hearing officer had no authority to either hear or rule upon those petitions to revoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.617" offset="9634377">We had asked the Board itself for our argument and the opportunity to file a brief, and the Board refused to permit that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.050" offset="9668127">The Board merely sent our petition back and attempted to force us to hand it through the hearing officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.089" offset="9716297">Now, in this particular case, I would like for the Court to remember that we are dealing with a representation case, not an unfair labor practice case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.136" offset="9756526">There's an innate and fundamental difference between these two types of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.529" offset="9786096">Generally speaking, representation cases and hearing officers whose authority is in question here are not covered by the Administrative Procedures Act at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.850" offset="9835311">Hearing officers are called trial examiners in unfair labor practice cases and they are covered by the Administrative Procedures Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.227" offset="9872823">Another thing to remember is that we are not concerned with the issuance of subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.044" offset="9892153">We're concerned with a much more important problem, the revocation of subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.248" offset="9920888">There has been some question about what might happen hypothetically in the future, where this Court through the hearing officers had no authority to revoke subpoenas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.782" offset="9967073">And I might point out that the first court that made a decision along these lines was in the National Labor Relations Board versus Pesante case which was decided in 1954 by the District Court of the Southern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.750" offset="10026945">And it doesn't seem to me that there's been very much disruption of the National Labor Relations Board procedures, although that case was entirely against the National Labor Relations Board on the very issues that are concerned here and it was not appealed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3568.525" offset="14274038">Now, the Board's practice prior to the passage of the Labor Management Relations Act, in 1947, was to permit hearing officers, and they were all called trial examiners in those days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.350" offset="14329313">Both hearing officers in representation cases and hearing officers in unfair labor practice cases, was to permit them to rule in the first instance on applications for subpoenas and if they chose not to issue a subpoena, they didn't issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.419" offset="14393574">Now, the practice of the Board since the Labor Management Relations Act has been exactly the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="3631.970" offset="14527843">In the (Inaudible) case cited by the Board, I quoted from the transcript in that case in my brief, "The hearing officer told the person that was asking for a subpoena I've got to issue it but I will immediately entertain a motion to revoke it and grant it."</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.851" offset="14599314">And then the union's representative who had asked for it says, "Now, let me understand clearly just what you want me to do."</text>
