            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">-- McGee, Petitioner, versus International Life Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.742" offset="66873">Mr. Mandell, you may proceed.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Arthur J. Mandell</label>
            <text syncTime="18.786" offset="75128">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.598" offset="106371">The genesis of this case began on April 4, 1944 when the Empire Mutual Insurance Company of Arizona issued a policy on the life of Lowell Step Franklin insuring his life for $5000.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.483" offset="205845">He named as his beneficiary his mother Lulu B.McGee.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.253" offset="228937">A policy was mailed by the Empire Company to the insurer within California, and he continued making payments of premiums to Empire until September 1st, 1948 when the Empire Company of Arizona reinsured its risks with the International Life Insurance Company of Austin, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.076" offset="368222">Based upon this reassurance agreement approved by both governmental agencies of Arizona in Texas, the International Company issued its certificate of reinsurance and mailed it to the insured in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.813" offset="467174">On September 1st, 1948 until some time to December of 1950, the insured Franklin received notices by mail of the premiums due and mailed his premiums from California to Texas and was fully paid-up when, on December 11, 1950, he died.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.241" offset="580963">Subsequent thereto, a claim was made on behalf of Lulu B.McGee, his mother, the beneficiary, and the claim was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.442" offset="637701">On June 11, 1951, Lulu B.McGee, through her California attorneys, file a suit -- filed a suit in San Francisco against the International.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.619" offset="698410">And the International, not having qualified to do business in California as required by the California statute and not having designated anyone to accept service, the California attorney proceeded under the Unauthorized Insurers Practice Act which was passed on October 1, 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.496" offset="813976">Therefore, after the passage of the Act on October 1st, 1949, throughout the rest of the life of Franklin, through December 1950, the International Insurance Company from Texas mailed notices of premiums to California to Franklin and -- and reply to such notices received by mail, the premiums in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.816" offset="975203">The -- the petitioner here, and plaintiff below, complied fully with the Unauthorized Insurers Practice Act as required by the California statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.771" offset="1051063">No attack has been made and is made now on the proposition that the statute was not followed with reference to service.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.237" offset="1092859">Judgment by default in accordance with the California practice was rendered in October 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.282" offset="1141029">The judgment was forwarded to the Texas attorneys who filed the suit in the District Court of Harris County, Texas to collect upon the California judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.642" offset="1194527">The District Court denied recovery on the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.508" offset="1222008">An appeal was made to the Court of Civil Appeals in Texas who affirmed the denial of recovery by the District Judge on the authority of (Inaudible) case from the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.602" offset="1306331">Most important hearing and application for writ of error to the Supreme Court followed and was denied, an application for the writ was filed and this Court didn't grant it.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.024" offset="1351993">The question for decision here is whether California had the right to pass the Unauthorized Insurer's Practice Act and set out therein the Act which if an insurance company does within the State subjects it -- itself to the jurisdiction of the State of California under the Unauthorized Practice Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.594" offset="1502354">Some of the conditions set out in the Unauthorized Practice Act, which the California legislature, in its own wisdom, saw fit to include as making that -- insure such insurance company subject to its process in accordance with the rules laid down included the mailing of notices or the collection of premiums from one State into the State of California and the receiving of premium payments from California and any other act or transaction with the policyholders in the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.844" offset="1723350">By stipulation, it is, of course, conceded that Section 3 and 4 of the Unauthorized Practice Act, which deals with the mailing of notices or notices by mail, has been complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.630" offset="1826482">Secondly, a claim was made in California mailed to Texas, the claim was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.802" offset="1883115">The Fifth Circuit in the (Inaudible) case held a statute similar to this constitutional but stated there that it would not apply if the contracts of insurance were issued prior to the time that the Unauthorized Insurers Practice Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.590" offset="2034312">And in subsequent cases on 206 F.2d and 207 F.2d denied recovery on that ground, it's because of these decisions that it got us from Court of Civil Appeals refused recovery in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.768" offset="2114978">It is petitioner's position here that the decision of this Court and the Travelers Health Insurance Company -- Virginia versus Travelers Health Insurance Company in 70 Supreme Court, 339 U.S.643, is authority for our proposition that all the act done by the International in California under the California statute subject to her to the jurisdiction of that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.721" offset="2342870">That statute complies with all the requirements of due process because in it, not only does it appoint a person to receive process but also requires that a copy of the pleading in the process being mailed by registered mail to the defendant, the insurance company, and in order to protect the insurance company further, the statute provides that in the event the respondent feels that it is not subject to the jurisdiction, it may come to California, file a motion to quash the service on the ground that they didn't do any of the four acts which the State of California provides constituting sufficient grant to subject itself to the jurisdiction of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.471" offset="2637845">And if sustained, it will not consider that as an appearance in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.714" offset="2670759">International didn't do any of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.133" offset="2692493">It sent back and let the case proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.955" offset="2707749">And defendant on the ground, first, as I understand it, that the act itself is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.399" offset="2753515">Second, that the act, as applied to them in this instance, is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.500" offset="2789982">And third, that the fact that -- that the certificate of insurance was issued subsequent -- I'm sorry, the fact that a certificate of insurance was issued prior to the passage of the California Act makes them not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.804" offset="2911190">We submit that under the authority of the Travelers case and of the Schutt case decided by the Second Circuit, the International was subject to the jurisdiction of this Court -- of the court of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.730" offset="3014844">Section 1611 and 1610 of the Act sets out pretty clearly, so that anyone doing business in that State may know exactly what are selling an insurance policy or mailing any notices may know exactly what it may or may not do before it subjects itself to the jurisdiction of that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.410" offset="3201567">In that section, we submit that a mailing of notices for collection of premiums has been declared by the legislature of the State of California sufficient to do business and that State to subject itself to the jurisdiction of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1021.655" offset="4086596">Now, the -- the question is one really whether the State of California has to write an authority in the protection of its citizens to set up this type of regulations or methods or procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.452" offset="4221806">Now, it is significant to note that when the admiral has passed the legislature so fit to state the purpose of the act and in its purpose, it states that whereas certain insurance companies had issued policies of insurance to citizens of the State and whereas it will be -- may become necessary for such citizens of the State of California to enforce the payment of such policies, policies that had heretofore been issued and -- and therefore, passes this act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.539" offset="4426083">The point that I'm making is that the -- it is clear upon the Act that California passed that legislature intended it to apply to policies then existing and not like the Fifth Circuit decided, that it need not apply to -- retroactively to file insurance policies issued before the passage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.514" offset="4558054">Because the very language of the Act says it is here to protect those citizens who now have policies and whom may have to sue in order to collect these policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.225" offset="4616882">And its unfair and unjust for these citizens to have to go and -- to other States in policies which are unbearably are small, seek counsel in far away States to enforce their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.485" offset="4669858">Now, this -- the question before this Court is, had California the right, the constitutional authority to pass such a statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.945" offset="4719700">And we submit that it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.029" offset="4748016">Now, the contention has been made and I suppose it's implicit in the opinion under Galveston Court of Civil Appeals that it is unconstitutional in its application in this case because of its retroactive nature and that the policy was issued in 1948 and the Act was not passed on 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.302" offset="4869120">But we submit that service of process is a procedural matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.727" offset="4918857">No one -- this Court has said and many courts have said as a constitutional right not to be sued anywhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="1910.959" offset="7643742">I think that this Court has written in several instances, probably the case which has become the one that's more frequently referred to now as the more enlightened rational is that of the International Shoe Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.087" offset="7732245">We would like to particular remind you that in that case, of course, there were some 13 -- 11 to 13 resident salesmen who lived in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.755" offset="7799014">Their commissions were large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.921" offset="7807582">A tremendous amount of business was obtained there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.452" offset="7821793">And this Court held in construing that situation that due process was not violated, and that the contacts of the State were not irregular or casual, that they were systematic and continuous throughout the years and that those minimum contacts did not offend your traditional notions of fair play or substantial justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.285" offset="7945091">Of course, in this case, we think an entirely different situation prevails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.507" offset="7969959">We have never had any sales personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.733" offset="7978841">We have never had any agents in California, and we don't believe that this case meets the minimum test set down in the International Shoe Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.177" offset="8028682">After the International Shoe Company case, of course, you have the Travelers versus Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.589" offset="8054282">And again, in that case, you had a general mail order business being done by the Travelers Health Association in which they have some 800 members at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.549" offset="8114155">They had solicited those members, not only about mail but also by those who are already members in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.297" offset="8157100">In addition to that, they have caused many sick benefit claims to be investigated within the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.001" offset="8195971">You will recall, of course, that you applied in the one opinion, the Osborn efforts and then International Shoe principles and held that the transactions were not merely isolated or short-lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.559" offset="8258142">And that the certificates were systematically and widely delivered following solicitations based on recommendations of Virginians and that there were many certificate holders in the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="3224.122" offset="12896444">And once or twice, the president of the company or some of its other officers would make sales promotion trips through in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.545" offset="12934165">And it did furnish the distributor with stationary and advertising and authorized it to settle disputes within the manufacturing purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.417" offset="12969587">Now, the other beer manufacturer involved did maintain an office in California, had a resident manager in six field representatives or home spent considerable amounts of time in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.051" offset="13024131">The Ninth Circuit came up with the answer that the -- and the District Court in both instances had quashed the service on the out of state manufacturing -- beer manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.484" offset="13085884">The Ninth Circuit came up with the answer that the quashing of the citation is to the first beer manufacturer even though there were substantial sales made, that -- that was proper, and it was interesting to me the comment was made about International Shoe case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.525" offset="13186090">The contrary rule, moreover, would raise grave questions of due process of law, notwithstanding the reexamination of the requisites of due process in this area of the law which the Supreme Court of the United States has undertaken and such cases as International Shoe Company and Perkins versus Benguet, Travelers Health and so forth, the leading case of Cannon Manufacturing Company versus Cudahy Packing Company, a case in which the local contacts of the Foreign Manufacturing Corporation far exceeded those in the instant case has not been overruled and more significantly, has recently been cited and followed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3418.940" offset="13675729">The other point that we would like to urge is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.493" offset="13689940">It is a-- an apparent deference between the Fifth Circuit and the Second Circuit in the case of (Inaudible) versus Iowa State, decided for the Fifth Circuit in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.960" offset="13747827">Iowa State was doing a general mail order business in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.387" offset="13769456">And the Florida statute is very similar to the California statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.855" offset="13791399">The Circuit Court there upheld the constitutionality of the Florida statute as such but made the, to me, very important distinction and that was that the Act could be given no effect which will impose retroactively the provisions upon the insurers having policies enforced prior to the enactment of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.581" offset="13914279">This distinction marks the line between due process and unauthorized state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.547" offset="13938103">Now, the theory upon which they proceeded in upholding the Act was that, if a mail order insurer wanted to go in to a State and solicit business there, that he was put on notice and charged with notice of the fact that there was a state statute that says, “If you come in here and do a mail order business, then you're subjecting yourself to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.973" offset="14051892">But that -- that same rule would not apply to those who had already had policies enforced in the State because they had issued the policies without any such notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.218" offset="14132872">And, of course, that is the situation that we have in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.216" offset="14160771">Our sincere belief is that the minimum contacts which this respondent has had with California did not justify, holding that the California courts acquire jurisdiction on the record of those minimum contacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.143" offset="14248542">In addition, we do urge the point that even if you go so far, and it will be for the gentlemen, then you have held in any of the case that I have been able to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.490" offset="14293891">I have found no other case in which this Court or any other court has held that an out of state corporation could be subjected where they had no agent who went into the State, either through members or as investigators or in some capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.995" offset="14395977">So that if you should so hold in this Court, you will be going further, I think, than this Court has ever gone before.</text>

            <text syncTime="3870.704" offset="15482776">So there maybe no misunderstanding, although I think the stipulation is very clear, the first insurance company, the Empire, issued its policy to the insured and mailed it to him in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.883" offset="15571487">It was in existence and premiums were paid from California to Arizona until 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.259" offset="15608999">In 1948, the Empire assets and liabilities were taken over by the International of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.060" offset="15664170">It is -- it may be, as counsel stated, that they didn't know, International didn't know that it was one or more insurance policies in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.984" offset="15723833">Whether it did or did not, we don't know but certainly, it was there for them to know if they sought that they find out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.445" offset="15761763">Secondly, the premiums were paid to International after they took it over until this man's death.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="3959.712" offset="15838772">How much premiums were paid?</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur J. Mandell</label>
            <text syncTime="3962.287" offset="15849117">There were, I believe, four or five quarterly premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.801" offset="15867193">Now, the fact that there was only a $1 premium per month or $3 quarterly or $300 or $30,000, I see, can have no material effect on the decision of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3986.368" offset="15945456">The principle is exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.081" offset="15956323">As a matter of fact, the legislature of the State of California saw fit to pass this Act in order to protect the little policyholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.751" offset="15994984">That's what it had in mind and it so states in the enabling clause of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.894" offset="16027481">Now, it may be that what counsel for respondent said that to pay a claim such as this and the record here is certainly, sullen of his validity or invalidity on the contrary, insofar as this Court are concerned and must assume that it was a valid claim because it comes from a judgment of competent jurisdiction and of the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.189" offset="16144718">There is nothing in the record except a pleading, which may suggest otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.081" offset="16176274">Nothing whatsoever that it's -- the claim is not valid or it has any infirmities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.783" offset="16203128">Now, it maybe that by paying this claim, it may or by subjecting the California -- the International to the California jurisdiction, may or may not work a hardship on the rest of the policyholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.968" offset="16275853">Let's assume for argument sake that it might, the place for such a complaint is before the legislature of the State where the Act was passed unless the Act, in itself, is so capricious and obituary as to do violence to the Constitution.</text>

          <turn speaker="arthur_j_mandell" startTime="4095.946" stopTime="4607.837">
            <label>Mr. Arthur J. Mandell</label>
            <text syncTime="4095.946" offset="16383687">No, sir, no, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.371" offset="16389433">There is a stipulation in the record that they have received notice by registered mail of the institution of the action after notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.728" offset="16430811">So that's why I made the point before that California, unlike Texas, is given the insurance company the right to come here and challenge the jurisdiction without subjecting itself to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.062" offset="16516180">Now -- so the question now remains, as I see it, whether in this instance where one insurance policy was issued and premiums were received in one insurance policy, does that subject the -- does this -- this one act, take it out of the provision of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.388" offset="16633522">In order to answer that question, we must look at the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.894" offset="16659540">The statute, and we set it out in -- it set out on page 55 of the transcript of the record, sets at a reason for the statute and it says, "The legislature declares that it is a subject of concern that non admitted insurers have issued policies of insurance to residents of this State physically present herein at the time of such issuance, thus presenting to such residents the often insuperable obstacle of resorting to distant forums for the purpose of asserting legal rights under such policies, policies that have heretofore been issued.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.000" offset="16847935">Then, in order to clarify and give notice to all those in interest as to what acts they are talking about on page 57 of the transcript of the record, it's set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.550" offset="16906136">One of out of two, the solicitation of application for such contracts, three, wholly independent of number two, the collection of premiums, membership fees, assessments or under considerations for such contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.593" offset="16998296">Now, it -- it's undisputed that number -- certainly, they did the act in number three.</text>
            <text syncTime="4256.778" offset="17027030">Number four, any other transaction of business arising out of such contracts and the other transaction is the receiving of the claim, the denial of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4270.191" offset="17080738">Now, this very question of whether the validity of this process can be tested with reference to the time when the insurance certificate was issued, was answered in the negative by the Second Circuit in the Schutt case, and that is 229 F.2d 158, and it's cited in both briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.304" offset="17217202">But moreover, this Court, in the Travelers case said this -- in Virginia versus Travelers, whether such solicitation is isolate or continuous, it is activity which Virginia can regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.393" offset="17329528">This Court has sanctioned such provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.070" offset="17352202">Moreover, the -- in New Jersey, I believe, the Boches verus Miami Air Line, 111 F.Supp.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.167" offset="17412598">There, the Miami Air Line, from time to time, flew over New Jersey, Orlando there and sometimes thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4364.651" offset="17458573">New Jersey passed the statute making it a minimal to process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.584" offset="17490233">Miami Air Line claimed that that was a retroactive statute and therefore, it was not applicable to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.504" offset="17517923">The District Judge, Federal District Judge held, of course, like many other decision, that as long as it give the opposite party fair notice, the issuance of process was a matter of procedure and did not affect any substantive rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.400" offset="17633593">Now, in the Schutt case, which held the retroactive feature of the -- of the process is no invalidity, just contrary to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.015" offset="17700049">The Second Circuit discussed what acts constitute sufficient ground to assume jurisdiction of the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4437.757" offset="17750936">Now, evidently, the State of Tennessee has passed an act exactly like the one in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="4445.969" offset="17783850">And the Court said, "Certainly, the mailing of the premium notices and the remittance of premium payments and the submission of proofs of death constitute the doing of any act whatsoever whether interstate or intrastate in nature exactly," as what's done in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.552" offset="17914149">The company is at one end or the other of each of these activities and one end is in New York and the other end is in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.360" offset="17969424">The noble argument of the great number of insurance companies paid their just claims which would have any relevancy in this matter, I -- I just don't see how it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="4513.871" offset="18055419">But historically speaking, during the last two or three years in Texas, at least, we've had some disastrous experiences with insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4528.487" offset="18113933">And the kind of statement made by counsel for respondent does not fit in with the facts at Pleasanton, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.672" offset="18174642">And I may say this, that the Brewery case, as cited by counsel for respondent, differs with the case at bar in that in those cases, the particular State saw fit not to make -- not to pass a statute covering this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4570.013" offset="18279967">The statute here was passed to meet the need and for this Court to set a test or whether issuing one policy or two policy or 50 policies before they can be subjected to the provision of the Act is to make an unrealistic test and to deprive these policyholders of their rights under the law as given in their respective States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4605.873" offset="18423432">Thank you very much.</text>
