            <text syncTime="898.892" offset="3595494">As we know and as government counsel has pointed out, Section 6 of the Military Leasing Act of 1947 provides for the taxation of the lessee's interest, as far as local taxing agencies are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.173" offset="3664666">Now, I think we would have that right regardless of that provision, but we say here, we are not taxing the lessee's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.889" offset="3699461">If we tax the lessee's interest, then we would, under the language in the Allegheny case, be required to evaluate the lessee's interest in property in accordance with regularly accepted methods of appraisal such as taking into consideration then term of the lease, the termination provisions in the lease, the amount of rent and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.056" offset="3804160">Now we obviously didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.806" offset="3823177">We based this tax upon the true cash value of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.085" offset="3848255">Furthermore, if we were to tax the lessee's interest, rather than the privilege of using the property, the legislature could never have accomplished the result intended, namely to eliminate a discrimination between lessees of private and public property and put them on an equal footing for the reason that, the lessee's interest would only amount to an infinitesimal part of the money that can be received in the fashion the legislature tax provided in this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.589" offset="3998302">Now as I say the legislature could have imposed a much larger sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.071" offset="4016274">The fact that it is equal to the tax on the property, does not make it a tax on the property because again as I say, a specific tax and of course a specific tax as Your Honors know is nothing but an excise tax and examples of which are occupation taxes, privilege taxes and license taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.074" offset="4120242">Those taxes were placed upon the lessee's use of the property in connection with business conducted for profit, to put the lessees on an equal basis, lessees of private or public property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.531" offset="4198087">For example, corporation A coming into the State of Michigan desires to lease property, defines that I have a parcel of real estate, a private person, and it finds the government has a parcel of real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.923" offset="4259631">Both parcels meet their specifications to perfection, which parcel will this corporation rent, certainly not mine because they know if they rent mine, they are going to have to pay taxes either in the amount of the rent charged or in addition to the rent charged in consideration over reduction in that rent and in that respect it's very discriminatory and it was that very thing that the legislature sought to eliminate in passing this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.916" offset="4411664">Now Flint versus Stone Tracy was a situation where the federal government sought to tax franchises of corporations in various states based upon and measured by the income of the corporation, including municipally tax exempt bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.019" offset="4495987">Now the federal government did not grant those franchises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.178" offset="4520647">If the federal government can do that in connection with state franchises not granted by it, then certainly the states ought to be able to tax a privilege of using which arises out of an instrument namely the lease of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.827" offset="4595252">The fact that the privilege of using the property is exercised within the jurisdiction of the state of Michigan is sufficient in and of itself alone to permit the state to tax, and I have covered that point in my brief wherein I say in connection with Home Insurance Company case which quotes from Savings versus (Inaudible) nothing can be more certain in legal decision and that the privileges and franchises of a private corporation of all trades and avocations by which the citizens acquire a livelihood maybe taxed by a state for the support of the state government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.370" offset="4733388">Authority to that affect resides in the state independent of the federal government and is wholly unaffected by the fact that the corporation or individual has or has not made an investment in federal securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.058" offset="4792216">One other point I would like to raise, counsel for the government refers the Senate Committee hearings and refers to Section 6 of the Military Leasing Act, we say it does not apply because we are not taxing the lessee's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.224" offset="4844878">The Military Leasing Act does not prohibit the taxing of a privilege of using the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.165" offset="4864627">There was no discussions in the Senate Committee hearings in connections with the privilege of using the property and while the army and navy as I gather from a reading of the Senate Report, were both interested in seeing that properties leased by the government for commercial purposes should be taxed in order to eliminate that discrimination that was ever present between public and private lessees, they were not able to arrive at any legal basis for doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.664" offset="4974655">As one of the senators I recall said, when it was suggested that you transfer title of the government to the lessee during the term of the lease, one of the senators said I don't think that would be constitutional because you cannot place ownership in a person that actually doesn't own the property by a congressional act, therefore they forgot it, decided to leave it to general legislation but as a last measure passed Section 6 of the Military Leasing Act which only infinitesimally helps in the situation to avoid discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.047" offset="5112163">It doesn't, because you don't get the same results as you would from a lessee of private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.722" offset="5170887">I see my time is up if Your Honors please, Mr. Street will finish.</text>

            <text syncTime="1312.199" offset="5248731">I don't want labor this too long, but there are a few issues that are unique to a particular situation being Continental Motors Corporation located in Muskegon, County; and a few points that I would like to attempt to clarify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.865" offset="5327412">It's quite apparent from reading opposing counsel's brief that they refuse to make a distinction between a property tax and a privilege tax, refuse to concede that this might conceivably be a privilege tax rather that a property tax and treat it that way throughout in both their original brief and their reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.326" offset="5421244">I might say our reply brief, the reply brief was only received yesterday, I will try to cover it in oral argument to save filing a reply to the reply if we can do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.686" offset="5470668">I think it will clarify the picture somewhat if we point out some of the instances in which Act 189 does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.634" offset="5506508">Post office is a prime example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.233" offset="5512882">It could never apply to a post office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.906" offset="5523540">There is so much made in the footnote of the reply brief that it might apply to the Pentagon building, that Virginia might tax the Secretary for occupying the Pentagon building.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.419" offset="5569620">Of course that could never happen under one Act 189 and I don't think it could happen under any other the very simple reason he is not a private individual or corporation who is using the property in connection with a business conducted for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.657" offset="5626567">So the same is of course true of an army camp, marine base; any installation of a sort that's not used for profit it could never apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.790" offset="5667109">Some reference has been made to forest preserves, grazing lands, I might point out too, if those are public lands, open to the public in the nature of the park and the government grants a privilege by way of a concession to someone to graze those lands, it again would not come within the Act, because of the express exception as long as that land is again open to use by the public and that's an important feature of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.224" offset="5780793">We have a forest preserve in Michigan and perhaps we can explain this a little more clearly as to just what might happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.705" offset="5806811">The (Inaudible) Forest Preserve is a short distance north of Muskegon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.312" offset="5825202">It is not taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.338" offset="5829277">It places some burdens upon our local government but certainly not unreasonable burdens and we don't care to tax it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.587" offset="5858325">But what if the government should lease that land to be timbered?</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.307" offset="5877133">We know what happens in Michigan well enough, when such leases are made, a large mill is brought in that brings in hundreds of employees and they bring their families, they must be housed, their children must be schooled, roads must be built and fire protection afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.706" offset="5950798">Then we have an entirely different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.530" offset="5962083">I say that private entrepreneur, who is harvesting the trees from that land for profit should be taxed on his privilege and this Court has held that he maybe taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.168" offset="6020598">I'd like to refer to Wilson versus Cook, where there was an Arkansas statute which imposed a privilege on anyone engaged in the business of severing from the soil for commercial purposes, natural resources including timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.788" offset="6087053">Now in this particular instance, it was a forest preserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.511" offset="6101995">The trees belong to the United States Government as well as the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.059" offset="6120176">This man was given a contract to sever the trees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.147" offset="6140552">He enjoyed a privilege granted exclusively by the federal government to harvest these trees yet a severance tax imposed by the state of Arkansas was upheld by this Court on the basis of James versus Dravo and other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.981" offset="6215889">Act 189 would affect substantially the same thing in this case, if these forest preserves were leased for that purpose and it's only just that it should do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.224" offset="6272836">There is some claim that Continental stands in a little different status here than Borg-Warner, because Borg-Warner is manufacturing automobile parts for profit, while Continental is confined to manufacturing tank engines for the army corps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.724" offset="6334798">There is some difference on the surface, there it's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.617" offset="6350367">You want to keep in mind however that Continental is competition Chrysler, General Motors and Ford who also like to make engines and who are at a distinct disadvantage in competing with Continental.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.044" offset="6400104">We don't mind that in Muskegon, but I say in the long-run anything that removes this spur of free competition is going to work detrimental to this government who may think temporarily they are getting a bargain by giving Continental the plant, rent free and tax free.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.342" offset="6481293">Claim is also made the Continental because of this unusual situation is an agent or instrumentality of the government then they sure of course should be tax exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.884" offset="6527478">That situation I think is covered in the case cited in my brief of Henneford versus Silas Mason and I don't know if I need to elaborate it further here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.911" offset="6571572">That same contention was made in lower court and ultimately abandoned on appeal, but what if we did even for the sake argument concede that Continental in this particular case is an agent or instrumentality of the federal government?</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.742" offset="6626952">Does it afford an immunity under the decisions of this Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.783" offset="6643043">I might point out that in United States versus California which is of course familiar to you and is included in an ALR citation on my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.646" offset="6686511">In referring to this restriction or immunity says it's equally a restriction on taxation by either of the instrumentalities of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.892" offset="6731546">The state instrumentalities supposedly enjoy the same privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.425" offset="6757669">But what have been some of the decisions?</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.414" offset="6773656">The early case of South Carolina followed up later by Ohio verus Helvering where the state owned liquor, sold it through its own dispensaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.046" offset="6816183">This Court imposed a privilege tax upon the sale of that liquor and held it valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.597" offset="6842305">The Court used this rather colorful language, when the state enters the marketplace seeking customers, it divests itself of its quasi-sovereignty pro tanto.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.043" offset="6884101">Even more closely at home when the State of New York owning the Saratoga Springs attempted to sell water through its own public commission, the federal government imposed a tax of $0.02 per gallon upon the water, and this Court sustained the tax saying that it is clear that where a state engages in a business in competition with private enterprise, it enjoys no special privilege or immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.430" offset="6989636">And even closer to home is Allen versus University System where Georgia setup a state commission to operate the University of Georgia and Georgia Tech and they were held liable for their admission tax to the football games, though conceding that, that was a part of an educational function and that education was a proper function of the state, yet that tax was imposed and sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.386" offset="7093499">I don't believe first that Continental is an agent or instrumentality of the federal government, but if so because of its peculiar activity, I don't believe it's entitled to any immunity particularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.174" offset="7140624">Now much is made here of the measure of tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.526" offset="7150028">In fact it's about the only argument made against it, saying since it's measured on the basis of the value of the property, that is therefore amounts to a tax on the property itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.429" offset="7209691">How could such a tax be measured and really be fair and just?</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.989" offset="7247935">It is suggested that perhaps if it were measured on something like oh we'll say in the case about the severance of trees on a board foot basis or in the Esso case where you sustained a tax of $0.06 per gallon on Esso for storing government owned gasoline, that perhaps if it were measured by gallons or something of that sort, it would be a different picture and wouldn't look like a tax on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.243" offset="7360888">But how can it be done?</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.179" offset="7364650">Acres is the only thing that might come to mind as being some standard of that sort but how would Acres apply to 3.5 acres upon which this $8 million plant rests in Muskegon County, why a tax of $10,000 per acre clearly would be reasonable?</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.336" offset="7441241">But there is for instance say 20 acre tract adjoining that's used as nothing but a testing ground, which is virtually vacant land, that land wouldn't be worth $200 an acre.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.644" offset="7486485">And below that is a 3 acre parcel used to dump waste that's not worth $10 an acre, certainly you cannot arrive at a fair and just tax on any other basis than -- the measure that the State of Michigan sought it to imply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.902" offset="7563598">Counsel's reply brief is directed at two things, the Military Leasing Act and the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.754" offset="7590975">He has repeated over and over again that the uses included in the privilege I mean rather that the uses included in the lease, the privilege of uses included in the lease whether the lease be one year, five years or ten, the privilege of use is also included in ownership you want to keep in mind and it has been held that we can segregate the faggots and attach them separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.625" offset="7694420">The burden of the argument there is that since the privilege of use is necessarily included within a lease or even ownership, it can never be taxed up to the same amount as a tax that might be imposed because of ownership or because of leasehold interest viewing it as a property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.916" offset="7783654">Now that simply is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.014" offset="7792013">In fact it maybe taxed far in excess of that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.093" offset="7808313">Just look at the gasoline stored by Esso Standard Oil for which they paid $0.06 a gallon for the privilege of storage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.068" offset="7844258">Now if Esso had owned that gasoline themselves and had it in their own tanks, they wouldn't have been subject to the tax because they would not have been engaged in the business of storing gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.634" offset="7890442">They would have paid the regular ad valorem personal property tax by virtue of their ownership at the end of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.564" offset="7922207">What would it have amounted to, possibly 10, 15 mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.057" offset="7940180">Six mills on gasoline worth possibly $0.30 or 0.35 a gallon, it's somewhere around a 150 mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.889" offset="7975497">Now a man who owns furs and has them in a warehouse will pay an ad valorem personal property tax of a few mills on it each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.143" offset="8012487">What if he elects to exercise his privilege which is included in his privilege of ownership of sale during a year, immediately a sales tax in Michigan of 3% or 30 mills is imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.446" offset="8073718">And his troubles are only beginning because the federal government then imposes a 10% tax which is a 100 mills because he exercised his privilege of sale which is included within his ownership, so that the tax upon a privilege may far exceed any tax that can be imposed because of ownership alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.720" offset="8170789">In this instance it's merely made equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.686" offset="8186671">The interesting part to me about this long reference to the Military Leasing Act lies in the debate that it is recognized that a serious injustice and inequality exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.623" offset="8246439">The long years of debate that had gone on in the Senate and in Congress results really in nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.263" offset="8288967">We've labeled a mountain and come up with a mole hill here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.585" offset="8302237">They all say it's a serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.667" offset="8310596">It's unjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.422" offset="8313626">Something ought to be done, but what should be done?</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.495" offset="8325956">What can we do that will bring about a fair and just solution?</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.380" offset="8345496">The inference is they have virtually given up except for one thing they're going to resort to a federal dole in the payments, in what they call payments in lieu of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.624" offset="8390426">Now some reference has been made to the fact that the school district I represent has been forced to accept some of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.444" offset="8417698">It's immaterial here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.579" offset="8422296">It did not apply in the year 1940 – '54 and it did not receive any for that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.371" offset="8449463">There has been a temporary act passed since which expires in '58 which for hire purposes will expire next year because hire tax for '57 isn't payable until '58.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.345" offset="8497319">We may have one more year under that act but we don't know whether it would be extended or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.514" offset="8518008">I think we'll all agree that this federal dole is certainly an unsatisfactory solution in any event.</text>

            <text syncTime="2221.583" offset="8886230">Well the lessee if he is going to get taxed on the whole property, will like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.990" offset="8903889">Act 189 takes care of that, it's only the property actually used, that's made available to and actually used.</text>

            <text syncTime="2661.758" offset="10646988">The counsel for Muskegon Mr. Street has just agreed with us that the privilege of use is one of the bundles of rights that represent a property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.200" offset="10704771">He has said that Michigan can take this one right of the property rights, the right to use and occupy, and they can tax that at the full value of the government's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.631" offset="10758478">I believe in agreeing that right to use, privilege of use is one of the property rights, is the only property right that the lessee has.</text>

            <text syncTime="2702.531" offset="10810096">He is agreeing that the lessee's interest and the privilege of use are just the same thing, not only in substance, but analytically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.238" offset="10856908">There is no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.024" offset="10868088">I suggest that to my main argument that the privilege of use of lessee, the tax against property are the lessee's interest which they have.</text>
