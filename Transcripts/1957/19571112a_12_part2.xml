            <text syncTime="12.220" offset="48797">Before passing on to what I think, possibly, more important part of the case, I might -- I might say something as to what was said about the interstate rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.180" offset="92682">The only interstate rate involved in this case were rates to Walworth and Zenda, Wisconsin which were the tail end of the west suburban -- of the north suburban line of the Milwaukee road out of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.323" offset="149211">The -- there was no independent evidence of any kind as to the interstate rate to Zenda and Walworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.897" offset="187559">The rates were fixed on that line to correspond with the intervening intrastate rates as fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.580" offset="226220">There was no special attention directed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.446" offset="237714">As a matter of fact, there's one train, it goes out through them.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.954" offset="247745">One suburban train needs to -- goes out, one comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.578" offset="262269">That's all the service they have each day.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.771" offset="275017">The complaint interstate -- the Illinois Commerce Commission which joined in the complaint and of course is interested primarily in interstate rates and the petition was based on Section 13 (4) directed intrastate rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.137" offset="340532">They prepared the complaint for the rate, the entire order will be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.297" offset="357146">Obviously, if the intrastate rates -- the order as to intrastate rate is set aside, there's nothing for the order to the two little Wisconsin villages to stand on.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.494" offset="421930">There -- there's a -- if -- if the Court, the District Court couldn't set aside, the order is to -- as to intrastate rates, they say the order shall remain in effect as standard state rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.955" offset="459755">Compared that to the interstate rate, the interstate rates necessarily fall and follows at a District Court an enjoining enforcement of the Interstate Commerce Commission's order into the whole order.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.543" offset="526106">Any other decree wouldn't have any consistency or any common sense in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.811" offset="563200">The -- that's their -- a very minor part of this case that I thought I would say that at the start of my argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.227" offset="1100904">Well, it is in our brief, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.434" offset="1113652">The -- the only ground upon which the interstate rates were fixed at all was to be -- to correspond with the intrastate rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.594" offset="1154299">And they said the intrastate -- it says in the -- the interstate rate should be raised accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.248" offset="1172898">Now, if you take off the intrastate rates, what is left for the interstate rates to depend upon, are you going to have a different rate of fare to Zenda than you are to the -- to the next station inside which is in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.300" offset="1233189">I would think that would follow and I -- I would respectfully suggest that -- that's what I think here.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.585" offset="1282299">Now, I believe that I will say a little more on the question of the jurisdiction -- conflicting jurisdictions if you please, or coordinate jurisdictions of the State and the Federal Commission over intrastate rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.850" offset="1379370">The -- there's no question -- it has never been questioned by the courts and I might refer to the North Carolina case, stating it very well, as to the paramount authority of the interstate -- of the State Commission -- state authorities, let me put it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.014" offset="1464007">I don't care to get the commission in yet, the state authority over intrastate rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.777" offset="1491069">The statute where the State Commission gets its authority is the state statute and of course it's different in the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.342" offset="1529313">But when it comes to fixing rates, when you'll -- adequate revenue, intrastate rates, the paramount authority is in the State Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.057" offset="1568183">And Sections 13 (4) -- 13 (3) and 13 (4) -- 13 (3), refers to -- whenever at any investigation under the provisions of this part and so forth, there -- shall brought an issue, any rate, fare, charge, classification, regulation or practice, made or imposed by authority of any state -- in the next -- made or imposed by authority of any state.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.537" offset="1742054">And then in the next Section, 13 (4) it says, whenever in any such investigation, the Commission after a full hearing finds that such rate, fare, charge, classification or regulation, using the same words, passing down a little, results in any undue, unreasonable or unjust discrimination against interstate or foreign commerce then the Interstate Commission can remedy the -- the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.509" offset="1865979">But it does have to be a rate fixed by the State which causes undue, unjust, and unreasonable discrimination against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.469" offset="1905789">Now, that doesn't mean always that it has to be fixed by a State Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.384" offset="1925433">For example, in my own state in Illinois, the carrier post a rate and if the commission -- neither the Commission nor anyone interested objects to that rate, goes into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.942" offset="1979768">And that's a rate by -- fixed by state authority under the state law.And there is no question in my mind that you could file a petition in the -- under Section 13 (4) in the -- before the Interstate Commerce Commission to remove a discrimination if there was a discrimination caused by such rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.515" offset="2058031">There was the case in the Florida state -- in the Florida case.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.390" offset="2073496">That was a court -- was careful to find that the rate there had been fixed by state authority although there has been no hearing before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.125" offset="2108500">It was a case where the -- under the state law, the rates became effective without a hearing as it does in most states where no hearing is demanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.021" offset="2144026">But that isn't the case we have in front of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.021" offset="2160013">In the case here, there was a hearing before the interstate -- the Illinois Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.047" offset="2180180">And where a hearing is demanded under the Illinois law, there can be no rate fixed by state authority under Section 13 (3) until that hearing has had.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.267" offset="2233051">We don't have to take a hypothetical case where a rate is fixed by state authority without a hearing before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.874" offset="2263458">In this particular case, there was a hearing before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.633" offset="2278504">Furthermore, the action before the Interstate Commerce Commission was brought by the Milwaukee Road.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.721" offset="2302851">It wasn't an independent investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.215" offset="2316852">It wasn't brought on behalf of the public or some suffering shipper, it was filed by the Milwaukee Road for -- for increased rates and the basis of the -- the -- the cause of action, if you want to call it that, as stated in the petition before the Interstate Commerce Commission was that the Illinois Commission had acted unfairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.724" offset="2418834">The Milwaukee Road sets up and it filed a petition in 1952 and that after extensive hearings, for -- extending for a year or more, the Illinois Commission after holding it under advisement for a considerable period, denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.706" offset="2490723">They denied the increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.688" offset="2502740">Now, the case is this -- expressly based on a contention that the Illinois Commission, which admittedly has primary jurisdiction over interstate rate had acted unfairly in fixing those rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1250.417" offset="5001613">A difference in treatment made between persons, localities or classes of traffic in respect to substantially the same service".</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.342" offset="5037349">There has to be some evidence of -- of discrimination of a different treatment of the interstate traffic and service from what -- on what is given to interstate traffic and service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.418" offset="5085623">The -- in the Burlington case, C, B &amp; Q case, Wisconsin against C, B &amp; Q has been referred to which -- as Mr. Justice Frankfurter said is the initial case under Section 13 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.449" offset="5137763">In that case, the Court held that Section 15 (a) which had been enacted also in 1920 but somewhat amended since, which ensures to railroads an adequate return does not apply to intrastate traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.620" offset="5202442">It does say there's a dovetail relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.514" offset="5209966">And this is what the dovetail relationship was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.441" offset="5221669">There -- as I said, if -- if there is inequality between disparity, is the word they used, disparity between the interstate and in -- and intrastate rates that -- that the Interstate Commission can make up that disparity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.050" offset="5280183">And in that particular case, there has been a raise in interstate rates and the decision was that the in -- intrastate rates could be raised accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.139" offset="5324487">The -- there is -- there's no -- no authority for the proposition that the mere insufficiency of revenue to meet expense gives the Interstate Commerce Commission jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.405" offset="5381538">That's just the jurisdiction of the inter -- of the -- that the Illinois Commission has -- that the State Commission has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.937" offset="5411736">That's why they -- when you say they have paramount authority, that's what you mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.745" offset="5430962">If they have authority to consider whether the rate is sufficiently compensatory to the railroad and -- and the -- I was anxious and under our law, they're required to fix so there should be a fair return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.185" offset="5488640">The -- if Congress thinks that there -- there should be more supervision and if they can do it within the Constitution, they could pass another Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.252" offset="5525002">But I was talking about the Act we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.306" offset="5537123">There's no evidence in this case, and no finding as -- as to what would be a fair proportionate revenue contribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.789" offset="5567112">And the Illinois Central case has been referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.913" offset="5579651">Well, in that case, they found the value of the property in -- in the suburb -- in the suburban service, the value of the property in the other service, the ratio of the return from one and the ratio of the return to other in order to -- to determine whether the rates they fixed for suburban service were sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.187" offset="5672647">And by the way, in the -- in the first Illinois Central case, in 101 F. 2d., the -- they didn't raise the round trip or single fare -- fares because they were already up to the interstate rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.437" offset="5757701">In the later proceeding, we just decided last March, they did raise them but in that -- it was joined that -- they said they should be raised but they entered no order because that was the proceeding which the Illinois Commerce Commission took part and entered the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.277" offset="5813081">The -- now, the case is not decided wholly on the -- on the question that I raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.671" offset="5854668">They're very important, very interesting and I think that the decision of the District Court if -- if the -- as I say, if the -- if the states are really -- if it mean anything when they say the state court -- the commission has jurisdiction, the decision of the District Court is 100% right on that point and should not be overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.903" offset="5935543">And I'm -- I base that on -- as I say, on the facts not on a theory as to whether they could have gone without -- without going to the Commission but they went to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.101" offset="5968353">Now, that -- I mean, it's five minutes, I guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.850" offset="5991340">The --</text>

            <label>Mr. S. Ashley Guthrie</label>
            <text syncTime="1500.225" offset="6000849">The Court -- the District Court found that the rates it has fixed, I don't mean the District Court, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.533" offset="6034077">The Commerce Commission found that the rates it has fixed were just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.892" offset="6055497">That -- just and reasonable for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.266" offset="6073051">That finding, the District Court held, had no support in the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.171" offset="6104607">The only support for it as appears from the report of the Interstate Commerce Commission was that the rates it has fixed for the same as those of the North Western Railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.669" offset="6154658">We have in our brief, set forth the colloquy where the witness -- between the examiner and the witness about the North Western and the net result of it is that he said -- have too much pressure that there was a similarity in the -- in the suburban areas served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.359" offset="6225398">Actually, the North Western rates were fixed on a -- an operation of 72 steam locomotives and only 3 diesel locomotives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.382" offset="6261447">Whereas the -- Milwaukee has -- was entirely -- is entirely dieselized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.777" offset="6287047">The -- there's no similarity in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.840" offset="6303347">There's never -- no foundation for the findings they're just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.769" offset="6319020">Thus, the Interstate Commerce Commission when it fixed the North Western rates, 288 ICC 115 said, the above analysis, that is the analysis on which the Commission's order was based, relates to an existing suburban operation for the year 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.733" offset="6382864">It obviously doesn't know how to contemplate the cost of some other suburban operation that it might be encountered with diesel engines, gallery type cars and bud cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.337" offset="6425287">I respectfully submit that the -- the decision of the District Court was correct and should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.620" offset="6450469">Thank you.</text>
