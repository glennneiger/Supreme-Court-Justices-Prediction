            <label>Mr. Peter T. Beardsley</label>
            <text syncTime="22.551" offset="90175">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.226" offset="112849">These cases are appeals from the decision of a three-judge District Court from the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.687" offset="138658">That Court in turn upheld the decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission which authorized the wholly owned subsidiary of the Rock Island Railroad to perform unrestricted motor service between Chicago on the one hand and Omaha on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.423" offset="205636">The Court's decision is contained in the record here at 192.T</text>
            <text syncTime="54.984" offset="219847">he Commission's decision is pertinent in the record at 93.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.862" offset="239386">The appellant's on the case are nine motor carriers holding authority from the Interstate Commerce Commission to perform operations between points and the territory of the Rock Island Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.524" offset="278047">The Commission's report notes that of these nine, only three of them are the carriers with real authority to serve the points and we accept that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.379" offset="329456">And my discussion as far as carrier operations are concern here will relate largely to those three carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.183" offset="356728">The names are Iowa, Nebraska, (Inaudible) Truck Line Inc.and the Des Moines Transportation Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.814" offset="379193">The other two appellants are American Trucking Associations and its Regular Common Carrier Conference.A.T.A.is simply the trade association and the motor carrier industry which in many cases participates before the Commission and the Courts in matters of general interest to the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.869" offset="443455">The Conference is simply a member of the A.T.A.family whose interest are devoted specifically to motor common carriers of general commodities operating over regular routes under authority from the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.782" offset="495073">The appellant's in Number 8 of the Railway Labor Executive Association, the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, and the Order of Railway Conductors and Brakemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.456" offset="525793">The appellees here are the Commission, Motor Transit, various traffic bureaus, and Chambers of Commerce and Groups, denominated shippers committee and employers committee of Rock Island Motor Transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.469" offset="573858">I'm a little doubtful as to the Government's status here, yet supported the Commission before the lower court but has not filed a brief before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.004" offset="607922">Coming to the effect of the Commission's decision here as I previously remarked, the direct effect is to authorize these completely unrestricted motor operations between Chicago and Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.937" offset="651703">And right here, I might touch on what seems to be a discrepancy between the map which we put in the front of our brief and that which is included in the Commission's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.766" offset="687020">The Commission's brief stops on the east at Silvis, Illinois but the Commission's report makes it quite clear that Motor Transit already posses authority between Silvis on the one hand and Chicago with the result that Motor Transit can attacked these rights between Silvis and Chicago to the rights which are granted in this proceeding and thereby render a true service between the two points Chicago and Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.036" offset="784091">Now, the map which we have in our brief is the map which reflects the authority issued in the permanent certificate by the Commission in September of 1951 which incidentally Motor Transit has never conducted operations under.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.776" offset="839053">And the circle points, the so-called Quad Cities over here at Rock Island, Moline, etcetera, Des Moines and Omaha are the so-called key points.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.718" offset="870818">They are set forth -- all of the restrictions applicable to this permanent operation are set forth in the footnote at page 7 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.885" offset="903523">And with respect to the key points, I'll just read the item that applies to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.715" offset="918779">"No shipments shall be transported by Motor Transit between any of the following points or through or to or from more than one of them."</text>
            <text syncTime="237.127" offset="948454">Now, those are the points that are shown there in the circle and as I understand that rather gobbledegookish language, it simply mean that Motor Transit under this authority could originate a shipment in Chicago for example, move through the one key point of the Quad Cities and go to any point east of Des Moines Island, it could not go into Des Moines.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.627" offset="1022433">And in the reverse direction it would be roughly the same operation, that is to say, going to through from or between one key point but not two.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.647" offset="1058586">Now, I've spoken of the direct effect of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.557" offset="1074155">The indirect effect is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.384" offset="1081469">Motor Transit presently possesses other authority which could be attacked with the authority granted here which in turn will allow Motor Transit to perform a completely unrestricted service, for example, between all of the points shown on the map in our briefs and between cities on the one hand, for example, in Kansas City and the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.903" offset="1151582">In addition, by interchange, a lot of motor carriers, Motor Transit could perform service between practically any point in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.823" offset="1191288">That's the effect of the Commission's decision, route wise, if I may put it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.092" offset="1208320">Now, as to the rate wise effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.967" offset="1219814">It simply means that the independent motor carriers will face the competition first in the railroad, next of Motor Transit at rate levels which are identical with that of the independent motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.378" offset="1261505">And finally, thirdly, the competition of truck service by Motor Transit in a movement of railroad bill freight and I might say this that with particularly with respect to low -- small shipments or relatively small shipments where there is any discrepancy in the rates of motor carriers and railroads, the rates of the railroads are usually lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.363" offset="1349381">Coming now to the questions which are presented here, the first one as we see it as well as the evidence supports the Commission's order.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.237" offset="1376862">We say it done and we agree with Commissioner (Inaudible) in dissenting who has said that the majority was simply overwhelmed by the quantity of the evidence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.309" offset="1417195">To put it in the vernacular, the Commission was a victim of a snow job.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.531" offset="1434122">Second, whether in any event the Commission has discretion to authorize the railroads to perform motor carrier operations which are completely devoid from their train service in all out competitions with independent motor carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="407.696" offset="1630772">That is to say the standard that the Commission use in there is public convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.215" offset="1648849">It never -- it has not impose in this case, any so-called auxiliary and supplemental restrictions designed to -- to limit the railroad to -- anything beyond a complete, all out motor carrier service as it has done in every important case prior to this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.512" offset="1709976">And I don't -- we don't -- we contend that that reservation is imposed in this case as in the -- one of -- one of the dissenting Commissioners here, (Voice Overlap).</text>

            <label>Mr. Peter T. Beardsley</label>
            <text syncTime="440.634" offset="1762534">The Commission says that it reserves a right in the future to impose any conditions required by the public convenience and necessity, not by the proviso of Section 5 (2) (b), which we contend as a part of the statute that applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.519" offset="1821989">And the -- on the second question, we agreed with Commissioner (Inaudible) in his dissent to -- when he said that the Commission simply lacks the power to do what it has done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.413" offset="1857620">The third question as we see it is simply whether the Commission after authorizing the purchase of restricted rights by a rail affiliate under Section 5, as was the case here, they subsequently void those restrictions by a grant of similar authority under Section 207 without imposing any so-called auxiliary and supplemental restrictions as required by the proviso of Section 5 (2) (b) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.745" offset="1954900">Here we agree with the Railroad Labor Unions that the Commission lacks that power and leave it to their counsel to discuss that one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.111" offset="1992411">This case itself is simply another phase of a proceeding that began way back in 1937, when Motor Transit filed an application to purchase a so-called White Line right between Silvis, Illinois and Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.150" offset="2048522">The Commission approved that purchase in 1941 and it reserved the right to impose auxiliary and supplemental restriction designed to limit the operations to a coordinated rail motor service.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.121" offset="2096483">I don't think I need to dwell on the history between 1937 and 1950 because this Court said it forth very fully and very clearly in its Rock Island opinion at 340 U.S.419.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.331" offset="2141309">In any event, we have covered it at pages 4 to 9 of our brief and I think if I may, I'll just leave it there.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.237" offset="2164924">Six months after the Court's Rock Island decision, the Commission issued this restricted certificate, which I call the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.142" offset="2192509">And as I said before Motor Transit has never conducted any operation pursuant to that certificate instead it has been operating under a so-called temporary authority since August 30th, 1951 which incidentally, is much less restricted in a permanent certificate shown in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.479" offset="2265861">In October 1951, Motor Transit filed an application for unrestricted authority under Section 207 and hearing were held in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.598" offset="2298358">And after the usual routine of proceedings before the Commission, it issued the report an order which we're complaining of in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.147" offset="2328555">Coming now to matters of substance if I may and dealing first with the Congressional policy which we think is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.084" offset="2364291">Certainly, long prior to the time Congress regulated the Interstate Transportation by motor carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.038" offset="2392085">It has recognized the tendency of railroads to monopolize transport whenever they were given the opportunity and it had taken steps to prevent domination by other forms of transport by the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.821" offset="2439210">For example, I -- they only refer to the Panama Canal Act of 1912 and to the policy set forth by Congress in the Transportation Act of 1920 to promote, encourage, and develop water transportation service and facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.144" offset="2492500">We've dealt with that in more detail and I will here at pages 14 to 16 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.439" offset="2513711">So that, when Congress came to regulate interstate transportation by motor carriers by the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, it did several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.307" offset="2549133">The first thing he did was to imposed in Section 202 of the Motor Carrier Act, a duty on the Commission among other things to recognize and preserve the inherited advantages of motor transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.985" offset="2595840">But it did more than and of course that language is now embraced in the National Transportation Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.310" offset="2621231">In -- in the Section 213 of the Motor Carrier Act which covers acquisition, purchases, mergers, consolidation, etcetera, the Congress set forth the criterion by which the Commission was to be governed in what I call ordinary cases when one -- one motor carrier wants to purchase another motor carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.462" offset="2689776">And it said that the Commission shall approve the transaction if it finds that it will be consistent with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.866" offset="2719451">Now, that same standard of course applies to a railroad purchase of a motor carrier but two additional standards were put in that proviso of Section 213 to cover cases in which railroad seek to acquire motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.527" offset="2770024">Congress told the Commission that it shall not approve the transaction unless it finds that it will enable the railroad to use service by motor vehicle to public advantage in its operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.328" offset="2821224">I stress those last three words because I believe they maybe the only thing about which there is really no dispute in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.286" offset="2849123">Namely, that in its operations restricts rail operation of motor vehicles to in any event something less than an all out independent motor carrier service, what I would call a "coordinated rail motor service" designed simply to improve the ultimate rail service.</text>

            <text syncTime="854.686" offset="3418697">The second additional criteria that the Congress placed in the law with respect to railroad acquisition of a motor carrier is this, "That the Commission shall not approve the transaction unless it finds that it will not unduly restrain competition."</text>
            <text syncTime="870.438" offset="3481704">And as to this requirement, the Commission report says here, "The operations of Motor Transit have not unduly restrained competition and there's no evidence that it proposed operations would produce such a result."</text>
            <text syncTime="882.473" offset="3529874">We deal with these findings on brief at page 63 and I won't say anything more here about that except to point out that the findings of the Commission would seem to place the burden on the protestants to have introduced evidence in this case showing that Motor Transit's operations in the future, contrary to the past experience will not restrain competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.513" offset="3610018">Now, we say that the burden in this case was on Motor Transit to satisfy every provision of the statutes and it by not introducing evidence and the Commission not finding any fault with that they have in effect transferred the verdict to satisfy that any monopoly requirement from the applicant, Motor Transit, to the protestants in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.479" offset="3689848">Coming now to the Commission's construction of this proviso of Section 5 (2) (b), I think that the District Court has set it forth very tersely and very accurately at 193-194 of the record here.</text>

            <text syncTime="938.027" offset="3752020">The Commission says the requirement is notably omitted from the terms of Section 207 (a) that the policy, not the terms of the requirement applies to the issuance of certificate under Section 207 (a).</text>

            <text syncTime="1016.375" offset="4065489">With respect to this theory of the Commission, it imputes an intention of Congress to require the Commission to read the language of 5 (2) (b) in the 207 except in cases involving exceptional circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.584" offset="4118256">Now, we submit first of all, that's a rather subtle distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.684" offset="4134661">Second of all, since obviously, Congress didn't use any words like exceptional circumstances in the law, it couldn't define it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.972" offset="4167784">And so, it remains under the Commission's theory for it to define what I meant by exceptional circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.297" offset="4193176">Now, the exceptional circumstances set forth in this case is the alleged fare of independent motor carriers to provide an adequate service to smaller points and the Commission says out of what we think is completely unless they got any sympathy for the railroad's subsidiary, we will allow it to serve the major points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.498" offset="4257959">What -- what will the exceptional circumstances be tomorrow if the Commission has complete discretions to determine what they are?</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.834" offset="4283246">They will be almost anything which the Commission decides to apply that term to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.072" offset="4304248">Now, it seems to us that the short answer to that argument is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.012" offset="4320026">Congress obviously was concerned with restraint of competition or it wouldn't have included this language of 5 (2) (b) in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.764" offset="4346984">And if it had intended to confer on the Commission the authority to just simply make wholesale exceptions to the policy expressed in 5 (2) (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.554" offset="4382198">Surely, it could have found a few simple words to add to the statute to make that intent clear beyond deferred venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.977" offset="4411873">I might say additionally, with respect to the Commission's theory is completely contrary to the position which it took before this Court in 1950, in the Texas and Pacific case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.196" offset="4452728">That case too, like this case dealt with the 207 application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.186" offset="4472686">And I'm not going to read what the Commission said in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.559" offset="4486165">I will refer the Court to what it said at pages 25 and 26 of our brief where you'll find at set forth in the blackest print we could find.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.106" offset="4524408">And as I said before, it's completely to the contrary of what it said then and you will find a good bit more of that black print throughout our brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.282" offset="4557113">Because with respect to every important aspect of this case, what the Commission tells the Court now is precisely the opposite of what it told the Court in 1950.</text>

            <text syncTime="1177.340" offset="4709355">And I will deal with that in a little bit more detail on the legislative history, Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.085" offset="4736313">That is our contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.205" offset="4752718">Oh, I -- I should have told the Court here when I was remarking about the difference between the Commission's approach now and what it was in 1950, I should have referred the Court to the page 23 of their brief in this case first and I didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.065" offset="4808202">There, the Commission draws the -- a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.897" offset="4819487">It says that when a railroad purchases a motor carrier, the effect of the purchase is to remove that previously independent motor carrier from the field, therefore, that's bad for competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.807" offset="4859193">It says however, when a railroad institutes its own service under Section 207, that adds a new competitor to the field, ergo, that's good for competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.617" offset="4894407">Now, as I previously said, that is diametrically opposed to what it told this Court in its brief in the Texas and Pacific case in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.197" offset="4928784">The final thing I would like to mention here with respect to the policy aspect of the case is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.714" offset="4950831">At page 14 of its brief the Commission says, it comes up with this remarkable statement at least to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.219" offset="4976849">It says the Court has already recognized that the proviso of Section 5 (2) (b) among other things does not preclude the Commission from authorizing ordinary and unrestricted motor carrier service by a railroad to points on -- on the other railroad and I stress this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.142" offset="5044558">"To satisfy a public need for transportation service which other carriers are not providing."</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.292" offset="5069113">That statement is remarkable for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.569" offset="5078204">The first one is it just evades the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.461" offset="5089802">If the Commission report in this case had confined the authority granted to points at which there was a need for service and have not gone way off the line and authorized service to points as to which there isn't a question in the -- in the record that there is already plenty of adequate service, I doubt it we'd be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.389" offset="5165453">The Commission does have a statement in its report, record 115 here, that the evidence respecting a need for truck load service "is not as convincing as that with respect to the peddle operations."</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.211" offset="5216758">Now, we submit that simply is the understatement of the decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.331" offset="5233267">Every witness presented by Motor Transit in this case and they presented a literal horde of them, almost 108.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.786" offset="5259076">When they were asked on cross-examination if there was any need for additional services to the major points, they said there wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.578" offset="5286243">That's particularly true, for example of Judge Reed, the Chairman of the Iowa State Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.758" offset="5302962">He made no bones about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.353" offset="5309336">And his testimony on that phase of the case is at the record 744 and 745.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.080" offset="5332219">In fact, I don't believe the Commission seriously contends in this case that's there's a need for additional motor service at points such as Omaha, Des Moines, Chicago, Cedar Rapids, and such as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.637" offset="5374537">Rather, what he has done here is to authorize Motor Transit to provide service at these large points because it says, to do otherwise wouldn't do justice to the railroads' subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.688" offset="5426678">But I talked about the contention of the Commission being somewhat remarkable and as I said the first reason is, that it begs the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.303" offset="5461159">But the second and even more remarkable aspect of the Commission statement is that it's exactly contrary to what this Court had to say on the Rock Island case at 340 U.S.443-44.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.907" offset="5511628">Where the Court pointed out that the announced transportation policy of Congress didn't permit railroads to perform unrestricted motor service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.221" offset="5544856">Now, that's what they suggested, that Rock Island unlike this case was affected (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.063" offset="5564186">I'll simply refer to the Court's decision in the T&amp;P case again which was a Section 207 case such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.431" offset="5589682">And where the Court at 340 U.S.459 held that the same considerations justifies similar treatment to railroad motor carrier operations while the applications to perform that service is filed under Section 5 or under Section 207.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.203" offset="5672751">I now like to deal, rather likely if I may with the legislative history and that's set forth in our brief at pages 21 to 26 in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.519" offset="5714024">As the Court might expect, there is a considerable disparity between the Commission's interpretation of the legislative history which is applicable here in our interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1485.290" offset="5941081">We rely principally here, of course, on the Rock Island and the Texas and Pacific cases which this Court decided earlier in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.126" offset="5972428">And at that time, you had before you precisely the same legislative history which is discussed in the briefs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.831" offset="5999282">I might touch on, first the so-called Shipstead Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.342" offset="6013283">In 1938, a bill was introduced which proposed various amendments to the Motor Carrier Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.098" offset="6036376">At that time Senator Shipstead also proposed to physically place in Section 207 of the Act, the precise language of the proviso of Section 5 (2) (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.482" offset="6077858">Now, the Senator subsequently withdrew that Amendment and the Commission tells us in its brief that it was withdrawn only because it was controversial, not because it wasn't necessary if indeed this proviso was to be read under Section 207.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.179" offset="6132715">The Commission says that at page 35 of its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.311" offset="6145149">And it doesn't quote at any great length from -- from what Senator Shipstead had to say at the time he withdrew his Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.966" offset="6171794">We quote at greater length at page 24 of our brief and we think that the colloquy there in which Senator Shipstead engaged with Senator Johnson is a clear indication that the real reason his Amendment was withdrawn was simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.418" offset="6237623">Commissioner Eastman had previously appeared before the Committee and had indicated that in its administration of the law, the Commission would in any event read the proviso of 5 (2) (b) into Section 207 whenever a railroad filed an application to perform motor service under that latter Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.531" offset="6318080">Coming now to the final leg of this -- of this portion of the argument if I may, of course, I don't think there can be a question in anybody's mind of what the so-called Kansas City Southern decision of the Commission is its landmark decision in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.635" offset="6398537">That was the first really important case it had dealing with the Section 207 application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.783" offset="6419122">And it decided in that case that it would impose the same restrictions in a railroad's -- in a certificate issued to a railroad to operate motor vehicles as it had previouslyimposed in the so-called Barker case which unlike the Kansas City Southern case arose under Section 5, where this language of the proviso was directly applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.242" offset="6500937">But as to the Kansas City Southern case there were two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.054" offset="6512118">The first one is reported in 10 M.C.C.221 and was a decision by division, 5 of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.171" offset="6536673">The second and subsequent Kansas City Southern case was the decision of the entire Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.930" offset="6559660">And the only difference between the two case is that in the second case, the Commission substituted for a so-called prior or subsequent rail haul restriction which it had previously used up to that time, the so-called key point requirement which is set forth in the permanent certificate which is shown in the front of our brief here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.778" offset="6643043">But the Commission has relied so heavily on the St.Andrews Bay case and the purpose is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.566" offset="6662165">They are seeking something, anything as an offset to the Kansas City Southern case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.221" offset="6680869">They cited the St.Andrews Bay case six times in their brief and I think its worth a little bit of my time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.846" offset="6707304">And the first thing I'd point out to the Court is that it is a decision of the Commission's Division 5 and not of the entire Commission, as well as the second Kansas City Southern case and indeed the St. Andrews Bay case may have been -- maybe considered to have been reversed subnormally by the Kansas City Southern decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.067" offset="6776268">Second, it's considerably dissimilar, factually from this case, it involved operations only between those in Alabama and Columbus, Georgia, points about 120 miles apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.405" offset="6821616">Third, we think its significance to a large extent may be judged by the fact that the Commission has apparently forgotten by 1950 when it filed a brief with this Court in 1950 in the T&amp;P case in which it included an appendix containing more than 140 previous decisions in which it had limited railroad service to auxiliary and supplemental operating, it didn't even cite the St. Andrews Bay case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.624" offset="6926420">Fourth, perhaps this is significant and we think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.165" offset="6940630">We were just curious to see the significance of the St.Andrews Bay case so far as the agency which offered it is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.159" offset="6968633">Now, we write it down in (Inaudible), it cited three times in the (Inaudible), in the Motor Carrier Volumes of the Commission, the last citation -- excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.941" offset="7011683">The last citation in 1942 is never been cited in a decision of the entire Commission even.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.139" offset="7036552">Contrary as to that, Kansas City Southern case is cited 65 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.616" offset="7058390">And so, what the Commission has done here as we see it is to drag this poor old skeleton of the St. Andrews Bay case out of its closet of long forgotten proceedings and it has used it at the major premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.493" offset="7113874">It has added that its minor premise and incorrect conclusion respecting the reason for the withdrawal of the Shipstead Amendment in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.173" offset="7148669">And by putting those two things together, it has come to the syllogism which is directly contrary to this Court's language in the Rock Island case where you pointed out at 340 U.S.432 that when Congress reenacted Section 213 of the Motor Carrier Act into Section 5 (2) of the Transportation Act of 1940, it was specifically aware of the Commission's practice of limiting railroads to the performance of auxiliary and supplemental motor operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.096" offset="7272281">What the Commission tells the Court here today is it when Congress moved that first Section into the second Section of the law that it was specifically aware that he Commission wasn't limiting motor operations of railroads under Section 207.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.325" offset="7341244">Coming to the final leg of this verbal journey, if I may put it that way, I'd like to talk a little bit about the factual matters involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.129" offset="7376457">And about the criticism of the Commission which is contained in the report here with respect to the operation it provided by these relatively small motor carriers between the Iowa points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.285" offset="7425045">They are criticized first because they don't provide as much peddle service as Motor Transit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1864.764" offset="7459004">Peddle service is simply the business of taking a truck starting it out empty for example, moving down the highway particularly were you have a lot of small communities, as you have in this case which are contiguous to each other and which individually don't generate a whole lot of freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.168" offset="7520653">And picking up at one town, say 250 pound shipment and moving on to the next center until eventually you have a truck full of freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.362" offset="7549388">And then you deposit that truck, you may take it on to other points and dump it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.532" offset="7566106">It's -- it's that kind of operation, they so-called door-to-door movement or a town-to-town movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.696" offset="7594736">And as I say, the Court is critical of the failure of the independent motor carriers here to provide as extensive a peddle operation as Motor Transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.089" offset="7624307">And it comes to this conclusion at record 115.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.648" offset="7638518">It says it would be unfair to restrict Motor Transit's operations in this case to so-called auxiliary and supplemental service, to use its words, and hand-over the truck load cream of the traffic to Motor Transit's competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.150" offset="7696509">We submit with deference that the criticism is unfounded and the conclusion is unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.011" offset="7723990">And we think that the Commission fell into error here by its failure to perform the duty which the Court ascribed to it in the Barker case of guarding against the danger of the development of a transportation monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.618" offset="7782400">The Commission we believe in all candor has simply abandoned its duty and because of that abandonment it's unwilling to disturb the status quo which now exists in this Iowa area and which has existed since 1937 when the Rock Island Railroad decided to parallel its lines with unrestricted motor service.</text>

            <text syncTime="2229.420" offset="8917577">But that argument overlooks what to us is the -- and what the Commission has really overlooked in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.570" offset="8938266">Namely, that you cannot view Motor Transit as a separate entity, it is a part and parcel of the Rock Island family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.073" offset="8968255">Now, the Commission expressed concern about the financial welfare of Motor Transit and it talked about this cream of the traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.099" offset="8992392">The railroad gets its cream and its carload tonnage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.921" offset="9003677">The Commission for example, in this report shed a few tears for the fact that the railroad's less carload tonnage had consistently declined over a five year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.268" offset="9045055">Now, if -- it -- it struck us, it's rather strange for example if the Commission wasn't equally concern with the railroad's carload tonnage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.664" offset="9070655">Less carload tonnage represents one half of 1% of total tonnage transported by railroads and represents less than 3% of the revenue derived from their total transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.104" offset="9112346">Now, why didn't the Commission inquire as to the welfare of the railroad with respect to carload tonnage?</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.671" offset="9134602">If it had made that kind of an inquiry it would have found that the railroad's carload tonnage had increased from 24 to 42 and a half million tons in a period between 1940 and 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.584" offset="9182250">It would have found that the railroad revenue accruing from that transportation grows from $65 to $180 million in that same period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.367" offset="9213388">And so, what we're really saying here is that the -- the Commission has gone into the financial welfare, so to speak, of Motor Transit just as though it were an entirely separate entity required to stand on its own two feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.446" offset="9269708">It has overlooked the obvious fact that Motor Transit is supported, subsidized, if you please, in every conceivable manner by its parent railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.265" offset="9305025">And the reason for that is obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.663" offset="9310563">Motor Transit performs operations much more efficiently and much more economically than the parent railroad could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.777" offset="9339089">But by looking at Motor Transit as -- as an operation which has to stand, as I say on its own two feet the Commission has in effect missed the boat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.148" offset="9372526">There is no occasion here for the Commission to be concerned with the welfare of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.418" offset="9393633">I pointed out those figures a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.701" offset="9402723">And certainly, as long as it doesn't have to be concerned with the financial welfare of the railroad, why does it have to be concern with the financial welfare of the railroad's creature?</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.572" offset="9442220">We fail to understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.554" offset="9458207">I did want to touch on one more point while I was on this face of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.549" offset="9482136">I believe to begin with and I think the record, a fair reading the record shows that the criticism of the motor carriers the (Inaudible) of a one serving the Iowa points is extremely unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.252" offset="9528947">And I earnestly call to the Court's attention exhibit 31, 32, and 33 in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2388.409" offset="9553607">I'm so earnest about it frankly because we didn't cover it on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.148" offset="9572519">Those exhibits show, the operations of Iowa and Nebraska for a period, I believe it was September 27, 1951 to April 15th, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.670" offset="9622674">The reason we went into them was because Motor Transit brief here at page 20 says for example, that it -- it has exclusive -- exclusive authority to serve 11 towns between Des Moines and Davenport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.115" offset="9664366">So, we got curious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.954" offset="9667814">We checked the exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.399" offset="9673561">We found first of all that that just wasn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.433" offset="9685682">Exhibit show Iowa and Nebraska is having delivered freight to at least five of those points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.471" offset="9705848">But that isn't so important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.978" offset="9711909">I recognized that that's not significant just as one of the parties to the case made a mistake in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.208" offset="9732807">But it seems to me that the significance of the figures that are developed by looking at those exhibits are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.893" offset="9759556">We found a total of 149 shipments, we analyzed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.113" offset="9776379">The largest one of those shipments weighed less than 6500 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.901" offset="9795500">The smallest shipment weighed 22 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.427" offset="9809607">Only five of the shipments were of a total of more than 2000 pounds, truckload cream of the traffic indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.102" offset="9836356">That's the kind of traffic that this little small operator is actually handling in this territory and we think the Commission was extremely unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.984" offset="9867912">In effect, characterizing this carrier and the other two, as in effect saying that they're shirking their duty, all they're interested in is the truckload cream of the traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.615" offset="9906364">The facts of records simply don't show that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.815" offset="9923187">Now, another thing that the Commission apparently overlooked in criticizing these carriers for the failure to render more service than they render is this, and we think it's extremely significant.</text>

            <text syncTime="4138.434" offset="16553691">To determine what conditions or restriction should be imposed upon Motor Transit's operations, and then these reopened proceedings, Motor Transit specifically refused to introduce evidence as to the public's need for its unrestricted motor carrier service to these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.841" offset="16631327">It stood squarely and solely on the legal position that the Commission had no power to reopen it's certificates to impose such conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4169.136" offset="16676467">Presented to that challenge, the Commission just automatically imposed the five restrictive conditions and in that posture, the case came up through the courts to this Court in the first Rock Island case, involving only the question of the Commission's power to impose the conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.716" offset="16746789">And that question was tested on the -- on the practically naked record as it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.595" offset="16766328">Solely, as a question of statutory power to impose those restricted conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.937" offset="16787644">Now, those conditions are at pages 5 and 6 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.167" offset="16804571">Stated briefly, they are that Motor Transit service shall be restricted to service which is auxiliary to or supplemental of the train service of the Rock Island Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4211.523" offset="16846054">Now, that raised auxiliary and supplemental as used in the first condition meant under the Commission's prior decisions, restricted to service, restricted to the movement of shipments on railroad bills of lading, and of railroad rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4229.078" offset="16916271">That's what auxiliary and supplemental was shorthand for, these shipments and railroad bills of lading and of railroad rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.830" offset="16951275">The second condition, service to be restricted to points which are stationed on the Rock Island Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.036" offset="16976144">The third was of key point restrictions, key points being Omaha, Des Moines and the Tri-City area or the contractual arrangements between Motor Transit and its rail parent should be reported to and subject to revision by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.441" offset="17037688">And fifth, reservation by the Commission of power -- by the Commission of power to impose further conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.354" offset="17073319">In 1951, this Court sustained the Commission's power to impose the five conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.829" offset="17103308">Following this Court's decision, Motor Transit filed an application under Section 207 for certificate of public convenience and necessity which in substance that the appellant say would authorize it to serve the points on this route without the five restrictive conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.744" offset="17178958">And in the long hearing in this application, the Motor Transit for the first time produced evidence as to public need for its unrestricted services, motor service at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.372" offset="17233398">And in November 1954, the Commission authorized Motor Transit to serve these points to transport general commodities subject to the following conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.458" offset="17277806">The conditions appear on the record at page 117.</text>

            <text syncTime="4406.150" offset="17624503">And may I say on the -- on the side as it were, the -- there is a -- a very bitter competitive relationship between these molds of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4414.799" offset="17659193">If Motor Transit starts to really shove around its independent motor carrier competitor, there will be no lack of complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.263" offset="17688973">The second condition which the Commission imposed and report now before the Court, was that contractual arrangements between Motor Transit and its parent shall be reported to -- to and subject to revision by the Commission which is identical with condition five of the prior five conditions which was sustained by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4446.211" offset="17784790">Also, as the map shows that at -- that except for a few small villages on the west end route, Motor Transit service is limited under the Commission's present order, the points which are stationed on the Rock Island Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4460.006" offset="17839961">That is substantially prior condition, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.708" offset="17854798">So, what the Commission did here after a hearing on public convenience and necessity was to remove the restriction first of rail billing and at rail rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4474.416" offset="17897639">And secondly, the key point restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4477.648" offset="17910491">And the Commission did so, on the ground that the proposed operations by Motor Transit would not unduly restrain competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4485.662" offset="17942570">And that that service was required to meet a need for motor service which other carriers could not provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.180" offset="17972663">Now, the opposed argument has a real sweep, they contend that -- that the Commission must in all circumstances, that they admit it in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4502.223" offset="18008816">It must be in all circumstances, to restrict the railroad's motor carrier operations to service which is on some way combined with a train service of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4513.725" offset="18054896">For example, they asked this Court to reverse its decision in the Parker case and to hold as of -- that as a matter of law, such motor carrier operations by a railroad, it must be limited to shipments which have a prior or subsequent movement by rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.135" offset="18128457">Now, the Commission contends that this proviso of Section 5 doesn't -- is not to be read into Section 207 as a rigid limitation of the issuance of certificates authorizing new or additional service.</text>

            <text syncTime="4802.533" offset="19210031">I have to add in fairness that the draftsman in 1940 made it clear in the Committee Reports that when they were transferring, this proviso from the then Section 213 to Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.150" offset="19256529">They -- they do not mean any change in the existing law whatever that was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4820.386" offset="19281502">So, we've gone back to the original legislative history in 1935 of the Motor Carrier Act and it seems to us a -- a fair characterization of that history was that no one at that time had a precise idea as to the extent or nature of the motor carrier operation which railroad should be allowed to conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.464" offset="19373767">Commissioner Eastman pointed out to the Committees that the railroads were experimenting in some directions with motor carrier service and that he had hoped that they would continue to experiment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4857.167" offset="19428624">And for the rest of testimony before the -- and the hearings before the Committees and they have given some samples of it in our brief, was just in the general vein that there should be some restriction and rail acquisition of motor carrier operations as they said, unless the railroads can acquire all of their motor trucks and motor buses unless restore to them the monopoly which they so long enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.878" offset="19519425">There's nothing in that 1935 history which gives any specific content to the key phrase in this proviso will enable such railroad to use service by motor vehicle, the public advantage in these operations and nothing at all was said as to whether that proviso should be read literally and rigidly into the certificate provisions of Section 207.</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.602" offset="19610331">All we can conclude from the -- from the original 1935 history is that at that time, Congress was not ready to specifically prescribe the railroad's role in motor carrier operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4917.175" offset="19668637">Rather, it limited itself to stay a broad objective of preventing a railroad monopolization of a -- of a new mode of transportation motor carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4928.020" offset="19712000">We think it deliberately left the Commission with a certain amount of discretion in implementing that objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4936.313" offset="19745228">Now, when the Act was amended and not -- when the Motor Carrier Act was amended in 1938 and then when in 1940, the Motor Carrier Act was combined with the Interstate Commerce Act and both extensively revised, Congress still apparently was not prepared to define any further what the precise role of railroads and motor transportation should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.586" offset="19834253">And that unwillingness to go further into the matter is vividly illustrated by the history of the Shipstead Amendment in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="4966.498" offset="19865913">Now, that arose out of two cases, two early cases decided by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4971.333" offset="19885244">One of was the Barker case in which the Commission began to develop this concept of service, auxiliary and supplemental to the railroad service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4981.367" offset="19925368">But in the same year with the Barker case in 1937, the Commission took the flat position on the St. Andrews Bay Transportation Company case that the proviso did not apply in the issuance of certificates authorizing new or additional service, motor carrier service by railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="5000.266" offset="20001019">Senator Shipstead disagreed with the Commission's conclusion and result in the St. Andrews Bay case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.996" offset="20027977">So, he introduced an amendment which would specifically and in terms, written into Section 207, this present proviso Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="5019.810" offset="20079177">His amendment was dropped or rather he withdrew it and in fairness, he apparently did it for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5026.734" offset="20106867">First, everybody told him all segments of the industry are the members of Congress, this is a controversial matter being introduced into a -- into a relatively non-controversial bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.767" offset="20151066">If you press this, we'll get no legislation in this session.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.530" offset="20166113">And the second factor, Commissioner Eastman and two other members the Commission indicated to Senator Shipstead that probably, they would agree with him in the interpretation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.339" offset="20221283">But nevertheless between 1938 and 1940, the Commission repeated again and again in published decisions its view that the proviso did not control proceedings under Section 207.</text>
            <text syncTime="5068.705" offset="20274782">But still on the general revision of 1940, the Commission -- Congress did nothing to reverse that interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5077.799" offset="20311144">Now, in the St. Andrews Bay case, to develop further how the Commission has interpreted this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.129" offset="20332460">The Commission took a rather flat ball position that the proviso had nothing at all to do with the granting of certificates under 207.</text>
            <text syncTime="5091.639" offset="20366524">Well, the succeeding cases and with experience, the Commission began to qualify that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.148" offset="20388571">The early cases that began to emphasize the element of shippers' special need for service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.619" offset="20410410">It also began to develop that the particular proposed service by railroads would not have an undue competitive effect upon independent motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.476" offset="20461819">And in 1938, as early as 1938, in what our friends refer to as the leading Kansas City Southern Transportation Company case and it is a leading case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5125.917" offset="20503615">The Commission developed and applied the general policy that in the absence of special circumstances, it would restrict certificates issued to railroads under Section 207 to service auxiliary and supplemental to the railroad service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5145.701" offset="20582713">Now, in 1946 in the Rock Island Motor Transit Company purchased White Line Motor Freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.755" offset="20615001">That was the Commission report which was before this Court in the first Rock Island case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5159.284" offset="20637048">The entire Commission stated in detail its view of the relationship between the proviso of Section 5 and Section 207.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.228" offset="20676859">First, the Commission pointed out as it always have that Section 207 doesn't contain any specific restriction on the issuance of certificates for new or additional service to railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="5181.538" offset="20726073">But the Commission added, and I quote, "Giving effect however to the National Transportation Policy as declared by the Congress and as colored by the proviso of Section 5, it has been consistently recognized in proceedings under Section 207 that except where unusual circumstances prevail, every grant to a railroad or to a railroad affiliate of authority to operate as a common carrier by motor vehicle or to acquire such authority by purchase or otherwise should be conditioned so as to limit the future service by motor vehicle to that which is auxiliary to or supplemental of the rail service."</text>
            <text syncTime="5220.833" offset="20883331">And since 1946, the special circumstances document of the White Line case has been cited and applied by the Commission, in both acquisition cases and on certificate cases under Section 207 and in both imposing and then omitting or modifying restrictive conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5247.223" offset="20988865">Then coming to the report of the Commission, which is now before the Court, it was issued in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.067" offset="21020212">The Commission again took the position, that the proviso of Section 5 (2) (b) does -- does not as -- itself as a direct rigid matter restrict the issuance of certificates for new service under 207.</text>
            <text syncTime="5271.844" offset="21087295">But again it noted that beginning with the Kansas City Southern case of 1938, it had followed a general policy of imposing the five auxiliary service restrictions upon certificates issued to railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="5284.445" offset="21137763">And the Commission added, that's in the report in this case, the main purpose for the policy of imposing the five above ordered restrictions or modifications thereof was to prevent the railroads from acquiring motor operations through affiliates and using them in such a manner as to unduly restrain competition of independently operated motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5304.961" offset="21219788">This policy wasn't as sound and should be relaxed only with a circumstances clearly established that the grant of authority has not resulted and probably will not result in the undue restrain of competition and that the public interest requires the proposed operation, which the authorized independent motor carriers had not furnished except for it suited their convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="5325.846" offset="21303380">But from the 1937 to the present time, the Commission has consistently held that the proviso is not to be read under Section 207 as a rigid limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.249" offset="21356983">Rather, the Commission believes that read with the National Transportation Policy, the Commission must take it into account and it does as a general policy to be applied in the absence of special circumstances of public convenience and necessity.</text>

            <text syncTime="5393.443" offset="21573695">And we submit further that this Court has already recognized that the proviso of Section 5 comes into play only as in certificate cases under section 207, only as a general policy against rail monopoly to be -- to be balanced against the public need for transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5414.409" offset="21657600">And we find that, may it please the Court, in the Parker case in 326 U.S.in which this Court pointed out and I quote, "Section 207 (a) provides for the issuance of the certificate on application at the proposed service is or will be required by the present or future public convenience or necessity.</text>

            <text syncTime="5673.586" offset="22694243">And in support of that -- and of that support of that conclusion, this Court cited the Commissions decision on the White Line case, to which I referred a few minutes ago, as well as this decision in the Wellman case, in which the Commission acting under 207 had authorized a railroad to meet and perform unrestricted motor service to points on its station where there was a peculiar need for service.</text>

            <text syncTime="6020.121" offset="24080405">I have lived more than 60 years in the City of Des Monies which of course is the center of the territory which is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.852" offset="24155324">The territory involved extends generally between the Mississippi River at the Cities of Rock Island, Moline and in East Moline, Illinois and Davenport, Iowa across the central part of the State of Iowa to Council Bluffs and Omaha which are on the Missouri River.</text>
            <text syncTime="6068.097" offset="24272353">And it is between these points that the certificate which is here under review was issued by the Commission after extensive hearings in which 14 days time was consumed in hearing approximately 180 witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="6091.131" offset="24364513">It is necessary, I think, that the Court have in mind the character of the territory involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6099.005" offset="24395964">Iowa of course is principally, an agricultural state.</text>
            <text syncTime="6104.343" offset="24417280">At the easterly end of this territory are the manufacturing and distributing cities to which I have referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="6113.406" offset="24453538">Moline and Rock Island and East Moline are the center of the farming industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.461" offset="24497842">55 miles west of Davenport is located Iowa City which has a population of approximately 20,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="6134.811" offset="24539220">The City of Des Monies is located 177 miles west of Davenport and 137 miles to the west of Des Monies, we have the cities of Council of Bluffs, Iowa and Omaha, Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="6154.105" offset="24616333">Now, interspersed along U.S.Highway 6 between these points are communities of varying sizes, of varying types, ranging in population, from towns of a few hundred to cities of 12 -- 14,000 and which are centers of manufacturing and commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6186.692" offset="24746736">As Mr. Ginnane has pointed out, the White Line Motor Freight Company was one of the pioneer operators in interstate commerce and intrastate commerce across the State of Iowa and it served the Chicago, Omaha area, having a route on which it operated with closed doors and with no service across the State of Illinois until it reached Moline, East Moline, and Rock Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="6220.367" offset="24881424">And then it had a distribution service across the State of Iowa from the Davenport to Council Bluffs and Omaha, Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="6232.624" offset="24930429">It had grandfather rights under the Motor Carrier Actof 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="6241.713" offset="24966792">In October 1937, the Rock Island Railroad subsidiary and the White Line Motor Freight Company jointly applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission for approval of a transaction by which the rail subsidiary would acquire the operating authority and practically all of the physical equipment incident to the operation of the White Line truck route.</text>
            <text syncTime="6278.414" offset="25113600">The Commission approved that acquisition but it reserves to itself the prerogative and the reservation and restriction of imposing at some time in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="6295.257" offset="25180996">The condition or restriction that it might impose restrictions to -- which would ensure that the service rendered would be auxiliary and supplemental to the rail service of the railroad company.</text>
            <text syncTime="6315.143" offset="25260513">In 1944, the Frederickson route was acquired which parallel the Rock Island rail line in the westerly part of the State of Iowa, a much smaller operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="6399.755" offset="25598955">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6400.202" offset="25600731">They were both purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6403.925" offset="25615673">So, at that time, perhaps inadvisably, the -- the Rock Island people challenged the power of the Commission to impose those restrictions at that late date after approving the acquisitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6424.703" offset="25698743">And when the Commission imposed the restrictions which Mr. Ginanne referred to, the power of the Commission was challenged by an action in United States District Court at Chicago and the lower court there set aside the Commission's action as unauthorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="6443.051" offset="25772199">And an appeal was taken to this tribunal where the power of the Commission to impose the restrictions was sustained by a vote of five justices to four.</text>
            <text syncTime="6457.050" offset="25828101">After the issuance of the mandate of this Court, in that proceeding, we went back to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6465.772" offset="25863001">We made a showing that there was a lack of service along the White Line and Frederickson routes by other motor carriers and there was a -- affidavits were filed and a showing was made to the effect that during the year 1950, carriers who possessed authority to serve points on the White Line route had turned over to the Rock Island Motor Transit Company for delivery on that route at various junction points, 5500 individual shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="6507.732" offset="26030916">The Commission first gave us temporary authority having imposed all of the restrictions, to handle shipments not in excess of 2000 pounds and after a hearing was held at Des Monies in September of 1951, they raised that -- that weight limit to 5000 pounds and we've been operating in the interim with a 5000-pound weight limitation upon any one shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6537.091" offset="26148362">And the record shows without any dispute here that that works a hardship on a great many of the communities and that there are many shippers who need a service for 10,000, 12,000, 15,000-pound shipments or truckload shipments, as the case may be.</text>

            <text syncTime="6559.866" offset="26239373">At this hearing, as I said, we produced approximately 180 witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="6566.119" offset="26264451">101 of them were businessmen engaged in various types of business on the White Line routes.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alden B. Howland</label>
            <text syncTime="6649.361" offset="26597355">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6649.818" offset="26599236">I think that that's a fair statement, if you please, Mr. Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="6655.986" offset="26623896">Now, not only did we have in this hearing the support of shippers and receivers of freight at various points that are on this route, we had the support of connecting motor carriers who interlined freight with the Rock Island Motor Transit Company at Chicago, at the Tri-City area, and at other points on the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="6685.747" offset="26742909">There were some eight or nine individual motor carrier officers who appeared before the examiner and testified to the need for a continuation of Rock Island Motor Transit's service to the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6707.141" offset="26828487">Now, they testified that they possessed in some instances, authority to serve these points but that the volume of business that would be available to them was not sufficient to warrant operation by them over some of the -- some segments of these routes and they interchanged and interlined freight shipments destined to these points from Chicago or from eastern points with Rock Island Motor Transit at the Tri-Cities at Chicago and at another points on the routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6745.438" offset="26981669">So, some of the motor carriers who are themselves members of the A.T.A.organization appeared in support of our application before the Commission and we put on an extensive hearing in addition to the witnesses that I have already referred to, we introduced evidence with respect to the cost of operation, the fact that this peddle service and we showed the nature of the operation, the cost of the peddle service was greater than the performance of point to point service in truckload or large quantity shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="6793.718" offset="27174870">And it was upon this array of evidence that the Commission found that the restriction that had been imposed was unwarranted and was unnecessary so far as the protection of the independent motor carriers was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="6815.841" offset="27263269">Now, the contention has been made here that the presence of the Rock Island Motor Transit operation is monopolistic in character and that it is a threat to the continued existence of the so-called independent motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6837.208" offset="27348741">The evidence n this case, I submit, if it proved anything at all shows that there is not the slightest shred of foundation for such a contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="6849.698" offset="27398792">Well, we attacked the matter from the standpoint of the national level.</text>
            <text syncTime="6855.235" offset="27420839">We showed by this -- the statistical information which we introduced that in the period between 1946, when the war came to an end in 1950 that there had been a reduction of approximately 60% in the volume of less than carload rail freight.</text>
