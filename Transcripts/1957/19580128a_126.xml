            <label>Mr. De Long Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="14.612" offset="58410">Thank you, Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.018" offset="71993">This case presents an issue involving the breaking of a citizen's door, the nighttime hours without a warrant and without notification of the purpose of seeking entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.312" offset="145241">The fact behind that question as they arose in this case, briefly are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.831" offset="179304">Back in March of 1955, about 1:35 in the morning, Federal Bureau of Narcotics, agent Wilson arrested a known narcotic addict who had given him some information of the payoffs named Reed.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.308" offset="245133">Reed was arrested on a warrant and charged a violation of the narcotic laws on January 20th, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.845" offset="287347">Reed told Mr. Wilson that he got his narcotics from the petitioner and from Bessie Byrd and he went into a little detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.682" offset="326635">He said that he usually met a man named Shepherd, about 3 o'clock in the morning and that he purchased 100-capsule lots of narcotics from Shepherd, paying therefore, $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.795" offset="391105">And that usually, he would wait for Shepherd to return with the narcotics, but on other occasions, he had accompanied Shepherd in a taxicab up to the 1300 block of Columbia Road, where Shepherd would get out of the cab and go into 1337 Columbia Road, at a place where an apartment was occupied by the petitioner, Miller, and by a codefendant in the case below, Bessie Byrd.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.286" offset="517120">Mr. Wilson took Reed down to police headquarters, but he didn't book him.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.350" offset="537391">He didn't charge him.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.379" offset="541466">He didn't incarcerate him, but rather took him to a street corner in the District of Columbia whereby, a prearrangement -- they met with several District of Columbia police officers, two Virginia State police officers and a number of Federal Bureau of Narcotics agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.666" offset="622655">It was planned and agreed as between the group that this man, Reed, would cooperate with agent Lewis in obtaining a purchase of drugs from the brought Shepherd.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.456" offset="669780">And in connection with that plan, Lewis was given $100 in marked money and it was also understood that Reed would go along with Lewis and that there would come a time when he would give Reed some of the money to show Shepherd and to tell him that his partner would supply additional funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.048" offset="756088">Now, the police officers and the Federal Bureau of Narcotics agents occupied two cars and these cars were equipped with radio so that they could commincate as between the two cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.763" offset="818991">So Reed and Lewis, the training agent Lewis left in a taxicab and proceeded to the home of Shepherd.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.980" offset="851905">Shepherd got out of the cab -- Reed got out of the cab, went into the house, came back with Shepherd.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.296" offset="885133">And it was later said that in the meanwhile, Reed had shown Shepherd $50 of the marked money as a sort of a bait or to show him that there was available cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.904" offset="951589">Then Reed, Shepherd got back in the cab with Lewis and they proceeded to the home of Reed and it had also been agreed that Lewis was to make an attempt to put the money on the proposed defendant, Shepherd.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.806" offset="1023164">And that if he did that as a signal, Lewis and Reed was to enter the Vermont Avenue house, formerly the dwelling of Reed.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.486" offset="1073842">So, that happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.705" offset="1082723">Shepherd remained in the taxicab and of course he was followed by the two -- followed the police officers and agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.791" offset="1115115">And the taxicab went in a great circle of route, on route picking up a soldier and two other passengers and taking them to their destination and ultimately coming to the 1300 block of Columbia Road, NW.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.024" offset="1168091">The cab double parked and Shepherd got out of the cab and went into the basement of 1337 which is an apartment dwelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.304" offset="1209156">Mr. Wilson, the Narcotic agent, followed him to the door, looked into the hallway and saw that Shepherd has disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.219" offset="1252833">Agent Wilson then went across the street where he observed the light go on, not in the apartment, but in a furnace room that was also in the basement.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.604" offset="1294315">And incidentally, in this basement, there were three entrances, one leading to the street, one leading to the furnace room and one leading to apartment No. 1, which was occupied by the petitioner and by Bessie Byrd.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.815" offset="1367249">Now, Wilson then got back into his car, and the two followed -- the officers followed the taxicab now occupied by Shepherd for about three or four blocks and then in a rather dramatic passion, they forced the taxicab over, stopped it and the cab driver got out.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.120" offset="1428480">The dome light flashed on and Shepherd was observed to put a package under the front seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.190" offset="1456692">Shepherd was immediately arrested and he was then searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.065" offset="1472157">He was found not to have the marked money.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.487" offset="1489920">And then, the cab was searched and the package was found under the front seat containing 100 capsules of a suspected opium derivative and I believe they performed an immediate field test confirming that.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.937" offset="1551673">Shepherd was questioned about the package and he first denied any knowledge of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.252" offset="1576960">Then later, he said that he has been up to Columbia Road, but that he had done that at the behest of Reed and Lewis and that he had been told that if he looked behind the fire extinguisher in the hallway, he would find the narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.010" offset="1639967">The agents and officers then immediately proceeded to 1337 Columbia Road where police officer Wurms went upstairs to the first floor entrance and he proceeded down the hall to a doorway and down from stairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.676" offset="1722619">When he got to the bottom of the stairs, there was a door leading to the furnace room and to the basement hallway and this door was locked.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.663" offset="1766609">Also, Wurms used the skeleton key and affected an entry into the -- the basement hallway.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.406" offset="1793567">In the meanwhile, Mr. Wilson had gone through the basement door, put it there to the door of apartment No. 1 and in effort to ascertain if he could hear any movements or signs of life inside, and he heard no such sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.010" offset="1863993">Wurms then joined Wilson at the door.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_o_douglas" startTime="468.940" stopTime="470.504">
            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="468.940" offset="1875696">Do you think he heard or he didn't hear?</text>

          <turn speaker="de_long_harris" startTime="470.504" stopTime="588.930">
            <label>Mr. De Long Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="470.504" offset="1881966">He heard no signs of life inside the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.443" offset="1897744">Now, when Wurms joined Wilson at the door, one or both of them knocked and they said they knocked very softly and in a very low voice said, “Police -- Blue.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.701" offset="1954795">Police open up!"</text>
            <text syncTime="491.480" offset="1965871">And that was repeated twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.601" offset="1978305">A voice from the inside said, “Who's there?”</text>
            <text syncTime="499.329" offset="1997218">And then, the door was partially opened and it was secured by an ordinary chain lock or chain latch.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.472" offset="2049881">Officer Wurms testified that -- know if -- wanted to know what they were doing there and to quote what was said by Miller as testified to by Wurms.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.941" offset="2107664">He said, “What do you all want?”</text>
            <text syncTime="529.807" offset="2119158">But there is nothing in the record to indicate that this question was ever answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.593" offset="2142354">And then Mr. Wurms put his hand inside the door, caught a hold of the chain and the door and forced the door open and in the process, broke off the chain from the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.100" offset="2204317">When they went inside, they said to Miller, “Sit down, you're under arrest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="555.891" offset="2223543">And likewise told Bessie Byrd the same thing and said, “We are looking for our marked money.”</text>
            <text syncTime="563.231" offset="2252904">Bessie Byrd handed on a housecoat, “We are looking for our marked money.”</text>
            <text syncTime="570.391" offset="2281535">Now, Bessie Byrd handed on a housecoat and the pocket of that housecoat contains the money and it proves to contain $34 of the marked currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.380" offset="2329496">Then, a search ensued and at the end of about an hour and a half, the remaining $66 --</text>

            <text syncTime="712.965" offset="2851840">Now, it is this petitioner's position that the rationale of Title 18, Section 3109 which incidentally only provides for search warrants, but says this, “The officer may break open any (Inaudible) or any door or window of the house, or any part of the house or anything there is to execute a search warrant, if after notice of his authority and purpose, he had has refused admittance or when necessary to liberate himself or first in aiding him in the execution of the warrant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="757.107" offset="3028428">That, of course, pertains to search warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.302" offset="3041176">The Government however on pages 10 and page 23 of its brief, concedes that the entry here must be tested under the standard as enunciated in Section 3109.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.878" offset="3103451">So, I will not concern myself later to that particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.400" offset="3117558">However, it is interesting to note that the original 3109 which was called Section 619 of Title 11 of the Espionage Act, was enacted at a time when Congress gave to the federal agents and to the Federal Government for the first time, a general power of search.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.644" offset="3222570">And incidentally, 3109 was taken almost verbatim from the New York law on this subject, but of course, since it only pertained to search warrants, it had nothing to do, of course, with arrest without a warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1367.889" offset="5471504">First of all, unless the necessities of the moment demand and in reasonable contemplation, the officers could not have secured a warrant, then the officer may not breakdown the citizen's door to arrest him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1414.890" offset="5659481">Before an officer can break open a door to a home, he must make known the cause of his demands for entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.655" offset="5690619">There is no claim in the case at bar that the officers advised the suspect to the cause of their demand, before they broke down the door.</text>

            <text syncTime="2679.718" offset="10718772">Now, I think that this is significant in determining the reasonableness of the conduct of the officers who sought to make the entry at -- at 4:00 a.m., in the morning, without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.638" offset="10778540">Because having arrested Reed and then Shepherd and in the light of this relationship between Shepherd and -- and petitioner, there was every reason to believe that had they not immediately sought to arrest Miller, he would've learned by virtue of this relationship or perhaps the general jailhouse grapevine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.390" offset="10877492">He would've learned that the narcotics officers had detected the operation of this -- of this group.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.335" offset="10909257">And so, when that fact is viewed in the light of the fact that the officers first learned to visit 1:35 in the morning and that everything which takes place in this -- in this case took place within the interval between 1:35 and 4:00 a.m., in the morning, I think that it it's apparent that the officers were acting not only reasonably, but under the present of circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="5418.468" offset="21673796">He looked across the street and then saw a light go on in the furnace room, which up to that point, had been darkened which I think supports the inference that up until that point, there was nobody in the furnace room.</text>

            <text syncTime="5432.266" offset="21728967">I think that those facts certainly supply probable cause for the agents to believe that what had occurred is that Shepherd went into petitioner's apartment that thereafter, somebody went from petitioner's apartment into the furnace room and thereafter, Shepherd -- Shepherd emerged.</text>
            <text syncTime="5453.875" offset="21815484">I think it is not necessarily inconsistent to say that it was not -- that the -- as -- as Judge Youngdahl did say that there was not sufficient legal competent evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner had possession of the furnace room, not in -- necessarily inconsistent to say that and to say at the same time that there was, on the basis of this -- these facts observed by the agents, probable cause to believe that in the furnace room as well in petitioner's apartment, there might be the marked money or the narcotics.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="5786.148" offset="23144490">Mr. Harris.</text>

            <label>Mr. De Long Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="5788.124" offset="23152431">Mr. Chief Justice, the Barientes case that my friend just mentioned here, for the case in which this Court denied certiorari was from the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.839" offset="23227350">There was a per curiam opinion in which the Court used this language in the per curiam opinion, while the use of the excessive force that is unnecessary for as in any case be depreciated, evidence obtained on a valid one is not thereby made inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5832.425" offset="23329646">So on the first phase Barientes which is not the situation here, because there was a valid one and they were of course discussing what I first discussed, 3109.</text>
            <text syncTime="5845.257" offset="23380950">But the curious thing about the Barientes decision is that Judge Reeves concurred specially and in the special concurring opinion, Judge Brown concurred with the special concurrence wherein they held that Barientes really didn't have a question of excessive force because the record shows that there was no force, and the Government argued and in the petition before this Court, in our position to the petitioner for certiorari, the Government argued that in Barientes, there was cause used.</text>
            <text syncTime="5882.978" offset="23531833">And probably, it might have been the basis of the denial certiorari of the Barientes case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5888.214" offset="23552836">So, Barientes case certainly doesn't apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5890.941" offset="23563703">I -- you have the Barientes case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5892.716" offset="23570808">In fact, I have a copies of the petition and the brief, you all know about it, but the factual question was not present in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5899.689" offset="23598707">And secondly, it was a case we won.</text>
            <text syncTime="5903.447" offset="23613753">I would like also to address myself to the question of Wilson's testimony at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5911.200" offset="23644787">Now, throughout all these proceedings at the trial in the Court of Appeals, I think Judge (Inaudible) in the majority opinion said that they could not tell from the record what actually happened outside the door in a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5929.194" offset="23716676">But the Government had no time to argue that it was the fact that anybody said, “You are under arrest,” before that door was broken.</text>
            <text syncTime="5940.010" offset="23760039">Mr. Sand also complains that we didn't cross-examine Wilson at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5947.541" offset="23790132">Now, bear in mind, Wilson had testified on the hearing on the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5952.780" offset="23811030">Now, this motion to suppress was filed within a matter of days after the arrest and filed to indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5961.591" offset="23846348">After the indictment and during trial and before the jury during the general hearing of this case, it was then that Mr. Wilson said that -- these words, “You are under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5974.629" offset="23898488">We want in.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5975.831" offset="23903295">But curiously enough, Wilson didn't even remember the chains being on the door's (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="5981.630" offset="23926491">And to refresh his memory, the counsels for Miller had to produce the transcript on the motion to read to him his testimony at the hearing on the motion showing that he had talked about breaking the chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="5995.020" offset="23979990">But when he got to the trial stage of this proceeding, he didn't remember anything at all about the chain and I think that's the reason why in the trial proceeding, the United States hasn't mentioned so much about this testimony of Wilson, because Wurms was the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="6010.549" offset="24042162">He put his hand and ripped the -- the chain off.</text>
            <text syncTime="6013.201" offset="24052715">He was the man who broke the door and at the motion, and at trial, he testified that there was nothing said about arrests prior to the breaking of the chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="6025.274" offset="24101094">Now, on page 134 of the record if the cross -- if the -- the cross-examination of Mr. Wilson, I think it starts on -- at the trial, starts on 133.</text>
            <text syncTime="6042.015" offset="24167967">And on page -- page 140 -- 134, Wilson, on cross-examination, is asked this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6064.790" offset="24259082">And of course, he has said above in answer to the question by the Court, the Court says, “All right, we want a deference, the witness.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6073.240" offset="24292937">Also, Wurms knocked on the door, he says, “Blue, open the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="6087.077" offset="24348212">Police!”</text>
            <text syncTime="6077.622" offset="24348108">There was a voice inside that says; “Who's there?”</text>
            <text syncTime="6080.438" offset="24348003">And Wurms again knocked in the door -- on the door and says, “Blue, open the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="6087.820" offset="24351242">Now, that was a response to an inquiry by Judge Youngdahl at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6095.024" offset="24380082">Then, following that inquiry by the Court, he was asked this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6099.253" offset="24397009">“That was everything also Wurms or yourself said?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6103.232" offset="24412891">Answer, "Until the door was opened yet.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6106.209" offset="24424803">"Now, when you say, until the door was opened, is it a fact that the door was not opened except by yourself and also Wurms?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6112.130" offset="24448418">"No, sir, it is not."</text>
            <text syncTime="6114.179" offset="24456673">Question, “Well, I think you testified there was a chain on the door which was forced by yourself and also Wurms.</text>
            <text syncTime="6120.163" offset="24480601">Didn't you testify to that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="6122.441" offset="24489691">The court, “He did so testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.622" offset="24498469">I don't remember him saying anything about the chain being forced.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6129.419" offset="24517590">Question by Mr. Willams, “How was (Inaudible) to the effectiveness to the apartment?"</text>
            <text syncTime="6137.172" offset="24548624">Answer, “Until now, I had opened the door and looked out at the door and then refused to let us in the place, the door was forced open then.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6144.366" offset="24577463">Question, “Was there a chain on the door?”</text>
            <text syncTime="6147.090" offset="24588330">Answer, “Not to my recollection.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6148.965" offset="24595853">Now, that is the same Wilson who also in the other proceeding, had told and described in perfect detail what had -- happened with respect to the chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="6159.390" offset="24637544">And that in the -- the further cross-examination of Mr. Wilson, when he was confronted with the transcript of the hearing on the motion, he then recall that he had so testified at the hearing on the motion and I think this testimony concerning the word, “arrest” prior to the answer to the door, comes within the same category.</text>

            <text syncTime="6200.360" offset="24801384">Well, in the Gatewood case, there was no act of breaking on the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="6204.640" offset="24818521">It was just according to the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="6206.274" offset="24824999">In that case, they forced open the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="6208.448" offset="24833776">Now, in the District of Columbia, we have the (Inaudible) decision which is in the (Inaudible) and I believe quoted in our brief wherein they've called back again to the common law, where they said, “You find a -- a door slightly ajar.</text>
            <text syncTime="6224.289" offset="24897097">You may push it, but if any force is required to open that door, it constitutes a breaking and you can't do that."</text>
            <text syncTime="6232.453" offset="24929802">So, I think, if you've got to use a force by pushing with a foot, I think that constitutes a breaking.</text>
