            <text syncTime="15.656" offset="62589">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.460" offset="77740">This is a direct appeal pursuant to the Criminal Appeals Act from a judgment of the Northern -- of the District Court for the Northern District Court of Iowa which dismissed an indictment for perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.727" offset="154854">This Court has postponed the question of its jurisdiction to this hearing on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.527" offset="186096">Before getting to that threshold jurisdictional issue, it is of course necessary to state the essential facts and particularly the basis of the District Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.871" offset="251402">Mr. Hvass, the appellee in this case is an attorney, a member of the Minnesota Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.192" offset="292676">He is not a member of the Iowa Bar or of the Federal District Court Bar in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.229" offset="328829">He wished to participate in two unrelated personal injury actions, both of them pending in the Northern District of Iowa as attorney for the respective plaintiffs on those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.195" offset="396748">Like most District Courts, Iowa has local rules relating to the admission of attorneys who are not members of the local bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.464" offset="445753">The applicable rule in this case is called Local Rule 3 and it is set forth at pages 2 and 3 of the Government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.072" offset="492251">The first paragraph of that rule, the Court will note, contains provisions which are fairly common.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.152" offset="520568">For example, the Out-of-State Attorney must associate with himself a resident attorney for purposes of receiving process and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.597" offset="562364">And it has a provision that the Court may call for a showing of satisfactory moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.517" offset="597995">The second paragraph which is more particularly involved here, relates to a special category of cases to personal injury cases in which the Out-of-State Attorney whishes to represent an Iowa claimant who has suffered injury in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.892" offset="699559">Now, as to this category of actions, the Court has imposed by its rule more detailed, fuller requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.257" offset="752953">That second paragraph provides that the Court may require the Out-of-State Attorney to show and I quote here from the rule, that the connection of the said attorney with the case was not occasioned or brought about in violation of the standards of conduct specified in Rule 8 here.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.549" offset="862145">Now Rule 8 to interpolate adopts for the District Court in Iowa the provisions of the Canons of Professional Ethics of the American Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.072" offset="920242">So the apparent purpose of this second paragraph of the rule in a nutshell is to enable the Court to deal effectively and promptly at the very outset of a litigation with any possible instance of ambulance chasing by an attorney seeking, believed to participate in a case in that court.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.019" offset="1288046">It also directed the United States Attorney as an officer of the Court to make an inquiry and to present to the Court any relevant facts bearing on the application.</text>

            <text syncTime="986.587" offset="3946266">The case would have had to go to the Court of Appeals rather than directly here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.236" offset="4012931">We say that there is no sound reason even if one were writing on a clean slate here and one is not, for holding the perjury statute to be restricted to proceedings which are conducted pursuant to a legislative act as this Court had occasion to note in the Ludenia Howard case on the last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.454" offset="4125780">The case not involving perjury to be sure but the Federal Black Bass Act, A rule or regulation may constitute a law within the meaning of a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.905" offset="4175517">There, a regulation of the Florida Game Commission was deemed to be a law of the State of Florida for purposes of applying a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.222" offset="4228807">And so far as the federal perjury statute itself is concerned, this Court decided as long ago as Caha against United States, a case that's decided in 1894.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.524" offset="4298083">That one may commit perjury when the oath is administered pursuant to a valid administrative regulation and that was the case this, as the Court will recall, which arose under one of the Homestead Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.063" offset="4360150">The Homestead Act had given a broad authority to the land department as it was then called to adopt procedures to settle disputed claims as to land and the land department had proceeded to adopt a scheme of regulations, rules of practice for disposing of context questions as to who among various claimants had made the valid homestead entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.407" offset="4489613">And Mr. Caha was a claimant in such a case heard before a local land officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.228" offset="4516885">The land officer got his powers only pursuant to an administrative regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.644" offset="4546560">He was indicted for having given false testimony during the course of that proceeding before the local land officer and he challenged the indictment on the ground that the act of Congress did not provide for the administration of an oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.224" offset="4608836">And this Court unanimously sustained the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.107" offset="4624405">It held the regulation was valid as within the broad delegation of the statute and it held further that since the local land officer, acting under a valid regulation, constituted a competent tribunal, the perjury statute heretofore supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.131" offset="4704444">Of course the -- the test under the perjury statute which is set forth at page 2 of our brief, the test for present purposes is whether a law of the United States authorized an oath to be administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.458" offset="4761809">Now we take it that there can be no serious question that a rule of Court within the rule making authority of the District Court stands on a footing which is not inferior to an administrative regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1261.689" offset="5046753">Certainly judges and clerks of Court have power to administer oath than to take acknowledgements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.662" offset="5074547">That power we think extends to all cases to which the judicial power extends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.937" offset="5103700">In this case, in addition to the general power of a court to administer an oath, the rule itself explicitly provided for that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.685" offset="5166707">In short, we believe that the broad language of the perjury statute does not admit of any exception for proceedings which are conducted pursuant to rule of court or pursuant to administrative rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1353.322" offset="5413198">Matters like filing of a tax return, a false statement in an application for a pension, a false statement by a selective service registrant, a false statement by a surety on a bail bond before the United States Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.301" offset="5493133">Indeed this Court in Novak against United States had a perjury case which involved false statements in a verified tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.273" offset="5540989">So I think that the statute covers any type of proceeding so long as the administration of the oath in that proceeding is authorized ultimately by federal law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1434.691" offset="5738684">It might be a mere filing of a report by a business organization with -- with a regulatory commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="2766.756" offset="11066932">Accordingly, nearly all of the Courts that have considered the matters support the doctrine of the determination of the qualifications of a particular person applying permission to the bar is exclusively a judicial function.</text>

            <text syncTime="2797.483" offset="11189917">That's why in a question of validity that you raised a moment ago, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe in putting the test as to whether Local Rule 3 is a law of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.132" offset="11244460">You would have a right perhaps to determine as impliedly within that question of whether or not that's ex post facto and as to whether or not its discriminatory because it applies only to a part of the -- of the state lawyers just to plaintiffs and not the defendants because it's not universal at all, because it's highly discriminatory, because the judge may put the man under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.891" offset="11339546">And he also, if you please, has the right to put the party under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.384" offset="11361489">He can call a party down and say, "When did you meet you this man."</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.942" offset="11379670">And so on and so forth and he can take the next man who is an out-of-state attorney and say, "I'll waive the oath.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2853.021" offset="11412062">That's what Rule 3 is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.446" offset="11417704">So insofar as you put the test to whether or not it is a law of the United States, you could determine whether it would meet the common test of a law of the United States because Rule 3 is not a law of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.076" offset="11500251">And further because the common law in -- other than a judicial proceeding is not a law of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.779" offset="11527105">We sincerely believe in trust that you will agree that the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed because nowhere in the Government's brief have they satisfied the second requirement that there is any law of the United States which in any manner authorized the oath that Mr. Hvass took.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.767" offset="11626998">And in absence of any judicial, in absence of any legislative base and we say there couldn't be any legislative base that this man is not subjective to the charge of perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.721" offset="11686870">And as we have pointed out, the attorney's relationship with a federal court, stems from the inherent judicial power and consequently any attorney who is guilty of any unethical conduct in an admission hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3106.805" offset="12427180">The effect of the land office at the Homestead Act to see that nobody got more than 160 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.694" offset="12454766">So they had a right, a perfect right to make a regulation and require an oath because it was bottomed upon legislative authority, a clear legislative base.</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.969" offset="13131860">That's quite a serious charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3287.287" offset="13149100">The rule says, "Permission to try a particular case."</text>
