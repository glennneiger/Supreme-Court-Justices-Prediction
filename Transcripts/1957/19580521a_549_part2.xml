            <text syncTime="988.399" offset="3953580">I have only six minutes but I would like to say that if you impose upon the petitioner the waiver which the Government asks you to do, you will be creating a new kind of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.316" offset="3993182">You will be creating a waiver in the very inception of the criminal prosecution which -- from which relief can in no way ever be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.739" offset="4042919">In the Companion case, the Government has -- has confessed error in the case and has admitted that where a hearing on a motion to suppress is actually held that this constitutes relief from the waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.207" offset="4100807">And you'll find that in the Government's memorandum in the Indiviglio and Diaz case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.944" offset="4123690">Here, a hearing was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.839" offset="4131318">The judge went ahead and ruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.306" offset="4137169">He heard all the evidence, he went ahead and -- and ruled on the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.929" offset="4151693">And I don't think it's fair and I don't think it's right to insist to the man on the very day after he's arrested be aware of all this legal -- his legal positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.516" offset="4202057">If -- if he had demanded a preliminary hearing, you still wouldn't have any more of the records than you have right here because those preliminary hearings aren't reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.029" offset="4232046">All you would have is a notation on the docket where it says "waived hearing" you'd have a notation saying ?hearing held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.186" offset="4256705">And the U.S. Commissioners, I point out in my brief, had no -- there was no relief that the U.S. Commissioner could give a petitioner that would be meaningful and -- and binding on anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.933" offset="4303726">If he let the petitioner go, the petitioner could still be rearrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.125" offset="4316473">The Commissioner's decision is not res judicata, it doesn't bind anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.321" offset="4341238">And I -- I feel that a waiver should not be imposed upon a person until he is in a court or a place where he has to take action in order to get affirmative binding relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.743" offset="4390870">In connection with the state practice, I -- I -- I feel that it is almost unfair to plunge the Court into the law of Texas because this can become even more complicated than I think the Solicitor General understands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.860" offset="4451370">We held, for instance, in Texas a statute Article 727 (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, that statute is not cited in the briefs by the way, which provides that any evidence obtained in violation of the laws or Constitution of the United States are not admissible in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.937" offset="4519706">And I think the provisions of the Texas Narcotic Act have to be considered in turn with the Criminal Procedure statute which adopts all of the federal rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.119" offset="4580415">The Government said, and I think significantly, we rely upon Walker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.337" offset="4601313">The counsel said that twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.720" offset="4610821">And I would like the Court to look at the Walker case in conjunction with all of the other cases which we have cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.825" offset="4639242">The Walker case is a freak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.370" offset="4649378">The Walker case was a -- a collateral attack by way of coram nobis on a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.136" offset="4672470">And the Court went on to hold originally that the man had no right to challenge the legality of his arrest in a collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.019" offset="4716042">Walker, where it says that this type of complaint is sufficient, relies solely on Rice versus Ames, the Supreme Court decision on the 180th U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.949" offset="4747703">Rice versus Ames is a foreign extradition case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.676" offset="4758674">And the Court explicitly held that it was departing from the rules that are normally applied in criminal cases because of the difficulties of bringing witnesses to this country from foreign lands to testify in connection with extradition proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.159" offset="4816562">With the exception of those cases, all of the law is that this type of complaint is insufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="1217.039" offset="4868075">In the first place, Judge Swnn said this is a collateral attack and it was -- this wasn't the way to raise it, but raised it before, but then he said, "But, we'll go on."</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.913" offset="4907572">And he goes on and said the arrest wasn't illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.238" offset="4916872">But he goes on and said that it was if that's no good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.392" offset="4929515">Anyhow, the search was made of a person not the petitioner, so he has no complaints.</text>

            <text syncTime="1242.225" offset="4968803">Exactly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.241" offset="4972878">And you will find that all of the other authority is -- is our way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.027" offset="4996075">This is a historical thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.325" offset="5001300">The Government says, Well, if essential facts means one thing in Rule 7, it must mean the same in Rule 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.852" offset="5023347">That is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.389" offset="5029512">The constitutional affidavit required by the Fourth Amendment goes back to the -- the days of the Writs of Assistance in James Otis in 1761.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.845" offset="5075278">There is plenty of reason for construing those things differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.171" offset="5084682">They're intended to do different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.295" offset="5093146">And they are historically foreign to each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.243" offset="5112895">I would like to discuss briefly of Mr. Chief Justice Warren's question about what is the federal practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.878" offset="5139435">I don't know what the federal practice is generally, but I do know that every Court with the exception of the Walker Court that has encountered this kind of case has reversed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.969" offset="5175798">And I know further that the reason you don't have so many cases, I will -- I will assume that the Government is in practice violating the Constitution by filing insufficient warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.482" offset="5217907">But the reason you don't have a lot of cases based on that is that it only makes a difference if the man is caught for something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.588" offset="5242253">Otherwise, he might just as well -- he's got no purpose to challenge the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.518" offset="5258031">What -- what difference does it make to him?</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.452" offset="5269734">He might just as well let the proceedings go on and be indicted and defend himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.304" offset="5285198">He doesn't have to challenge the initial process which brought him to the bar of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.031" offset="5308082">And because of the fact that I'm -- I'm sure it's comparatively rare that the Government is successful as they were here in catching the man because that is a comparatively rare situation, you don't have many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.871" offset="5359386">But I don't think that that practice which I believe to be violative of the Constitution should be encouraged.</text>
