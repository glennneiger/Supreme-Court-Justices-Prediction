            <label>Mr. Leonard Sarner</label>
            <text syncTime="20.464" offset="81816">If Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.432" offset="85682">You'll recall that Mr. Harwood was presenting the argument -- part of the argument on behalf of both these carriers and he has a little time left.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.010" offset="124029">He'd like to reserve that until the end of the argument to present these points.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.420" offset="153600">If you will read now to these -- these cases involved the deductibility for income tax purposes of fines paid to various States were operating on a highways at these States, motor vehicles which exceeded the maximum weights or actual weight limitations prescribed by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.074" offset="240222">The -- they raised the problem with the allied case, cases of Sullivan, Massei and Ross of the use of a public policy rationale or as the Government is raising in the allied cases, payments which are made for the -- to obtain the commission of a crime by the recipient as being excluded from this concept of ordinary and necessary business expenses for purposes of deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.614" offset="386403">Of course, I think, we'll all agree that the use of public policy that to allow us for example to deduct these fines in someway remits, reduces the punishment using it in a broad sense which the State has imposed upon us for exceeding this weight laws or its subsidiary that you can't deduct illegal payments and I call your attention Your Honors that this is a subsidiary argument and subsidiary rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.226" offset="500820">The reason why illegal payments if they cannot be deducted would depend again on the fact that it frustrates the policy of the State which makes this activity for which the payment has made a particular crime or proscribes its commission, of course, this has a smooth sounding clause ability.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.596" offset="578351">I mean it may shock all of us, most of us, that businessmen will transgress the law and that when they're following for this transgression, when they're so-called punished for the transgression or when they want to make payments which are proscribed, which are designated possibly a crime or some sort of prohibited activity that the tax law should so recognize these payments as to allow that deductibility in computing the revenue, the amount which has to be paid to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.126" offset="708441">But Your Honors, this use of public policy or this use of an illegal payment by the Government in these cases which has been, to some extent as we all see, developed in a very confusing way by the Courts is a completely foreign concept to the purposes, to the intendment of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.141" offset="812513">I'd like Your Honors to look at page 21 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.874" offset="827455">We quote what the Congress -- what the committee of Congress was considering when the original 1913 bill was passed after the enactment of the Sixteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.921" offset="875624">And at this time, it was suggested by Senator Starling that there should be some amendments to the bill which would limit the deductibility of expenses in computing income to legal expenses, to a legal trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.847" offset="939363">And Senator Williams, who was a ranking member of the committee at that time, said the object of this bill is --</text>

            <text syncTime="244.396" offset="977502">He said the object of this bill is to tax a man's net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.364" offset="997355">That is to say, what he has at the end of the year after deducting from his receipts, his expenditures or losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.735" offset="1030896">It is not to reform man's moral characters, that is not the object of the bill at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.671" offset="1054616">The tax is not levied for the purpose of restraining people from betting on horse races or upon futures, but the tax is framed for the purpose of making a man pay upon his net income, his actual profit during the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.436" offset="1117727">The law does not care where he got it form, so far as the tax is concerned although the law may very properly care in another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.347" offset="1157329">Now, I'm sure that my friends representing the -- the respondents in Sullivan, Ross and Massei will amplify this concept of the legislative history and the various times that it was sought by the Congress, by some members of Congress to proscribe the concept of ordinary and necessary by a limitation that it can't be some sort of an illegal expense and all of these times, this was rejected by the Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.122" offset="1412389">And the debates at that point of time point out that this actually would amount to a tax on gross income, not on net income which is the intendment of the Revenue Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="485.240" offset="1940898">They take the view that just because an expenditure is economically involved or integral, so intertwined with the production of the income that in and of itself does not make the expense deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.729" offset="2010906">We agreed the three quarters of -- of some of the arguments that are made are made or what I say is the straw premise, we don't deny that merely because an expenditure is economically involved in the production of income that it is automatically deductible.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.254" offset="2080914">We admit that it must be ordinary and necessary, and here an answer to Justice Frankfurter, I think we come to the point of the role that public policy in the context that its used by these courts and by the respondent that in someway the -- the States set forth a policy and to allow an income tax deduction of expenditures made which may be in violation of that policy, frustrates, prevents, interferes with the States' enforcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="708.054" offset="2832196">These are just illustrative of typical types of business expenses which have further limitations on them that salaries must be reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="732.547" offset="2930103">But to come back to what Justice Frankfurter pointed out, in a big sense, public policy and illegality plays a very important part in what is ordinary and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.731" offset="2982870">That is when the law of a State, where people are doing business, proscribed certain conduct, when societies for example, professional societies frown upon certain conduct, this puts a general limitation on what people ordinarily and normally do.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.693" offset="3066671">There is no doubt that if it's illegal to -- to make certain types of payments generally, in the business community, in the reputable business community, people will not make those certain types of payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.195" offset="3120692">But the concept of -- and to that extent, it plays into the concept of ordinary and necessary because ordinary, as Your Honors have pointed out in a number of cases, means common, frequent, normal, usual in this particular type of business and I agree that in a -- in a normal let us say, in the normal legitimate business, it is unusual, it is not common, it is not frequent to find that the taxpayer is bribing public officials to get state contracts to find that the -- that the taxpayer is -- is otherwise violating the law in his expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.427" offset="3269695">And hence, it's not that the State proscribes this and says, “This is a -- a criminal act or this is a penalty, we punish you for doing this.”</text>
            <text syncTime="826.699" offset="3306789">This sets the normal pattern of what people do in the business community, the community with which we are particularly interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.503" offset="3342002">But this Court has also pointed out, Your Honors, in the -- in the Lilly case, the Heininger case, you pointed out that what is ordinary and normal means for a particular business.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.807" offset="3407203">And therefore, if you have in the gamblers cases, I have no doubt if you have an illegal business and you do have expenses which are integral and normal and common, assuming you as -- you work with the assumption that you do have the illegal business operating, that Government for purposes of revenue, for tax purposes is interested and so intended, when it enacted the Revenue Act to take just the net amount of the income.</text>

            <text syncTime="1843.391" offset="7373531">Your Honors, I like to -- since I just got a few minutes left, I'd like to point out one or two things, the concept of frustration has no bounds, whatsoever, because if you say that to allow the deduction of this fine would frustrate interfere with the policy set forth by the weight limitation laws then even more so, does it interfere with those policies to allow the deduction of the drivers' salaries, to allow the depreciation on the vehicles, to allow us to deduct any expenditure involved in the operation of this business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.231" offset="7516891">And that of course comes to the position that former Attorney Brown now had taken when he addressed the American Bar Association to a position which the Government in the petition for certiorari was reaching to take but would say refraining from in this brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.831" offset="7575301">And that is that whenever you have an illegal business or whenever you have say a transgression of a legal business, you attack the entire gross income, not the net income because to allow any expenditure, any expenditure as a deduction for tax purposes, allows this activity to continue in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.231" offset="7652833">And therefore, if you want to use the Revenue Law to enforce these state laws, then disallow all expenses whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.157" offset="7684598">And I think, Your Honors, it's very important to note that not only is there nothing in the code but there is nothing in the regulations at all to cover this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.037" offset="7732140">But the regulations do have a penalty provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.660" offset="7750635">At the time this doctrine was being evolved in the courts about frustrating public policy, the -- one of the circuits decided the case that penalty payments paid for violation of federal income tax laws such as the fraud payment, or the negligence or the delinquency payments were not deductible as necessary in ordinary business expense though they thought there might be some doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.099" offset="7848333">And thereafter, the treasury incorporated in the regulations, this penalty provision and it is limited to penalty payments made in connection with violation of the federal income tax law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.764" offset="7899011">Now, of course that's a totally different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.780" offset="7907056">We don't deny that Congress on one hand can make a determination and therefore, in order to aid in the enforcement of its own laws, can deny income tax recognition to a lot of things.</text>

            <text syncTime="2140.611" offset="8562416">The issue in this case is what ordinary and necessary means and it's the position of the Government that this Court should not put its stamp of approval upon allowing the deduction under the guise or theory of ordinary or -- and necessary, the various charges that a law breaker incurs in running his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.670" offset="8698671">Now, the effect of such an action is obvious, if you will follow me regarding the economics of the situation, we are not for a moment saying that Federal Government should take upon itself the of enforcing all of the state laws of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.261" offset="8777038">It has enough of a problem as it is, but we are saying that this Court should not approve in anyway or intrude upon the sound decisions of the lower court where they say that you can't violate the laws of the Federal Government of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.839" offset="8871288">And then charge off, to the extent of that federal tax, the cost of that violation and thereby frustrate or reduce the penalty conceived by the States and deplete the enforcement of their laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="2288.994" offset="9155918">Now, the problem you have in the preceding case is that there is about $28,000 of fines and these laws are not just made to protect the roads or to get enough money so the State can replace the road that a truck breaks down because it violates these laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.568" offset="9234181">They're made for two reasons, that's one of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2374.158" offset="9496555">And that's one of the reasons that's been given by counsel and it's shown in the record for they're having overweight on the one act in violation of this law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.095" offset="9532291">Another is that their weight shifts, during the shift over the roads and they say that can't be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.054" offset="9568131">Now, if the space were large enough so that it would cut in to their net property in a very substantial way and they could use -- they could see that they might save it.</text>
