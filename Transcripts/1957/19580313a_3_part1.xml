            <label>Mr. Narciso Puente, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="29.405" offset="117551">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.230" offset="124865">The argument presentation has to be divided between Mr. Axtell and myself and we would like to reserve five minutes for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.875" offset="195500">This is a – this is a writ of certiorari to review on order or a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which affirmed a judgment of United States District Court for the Southern District of New York which dismissed the plaintiff's complaint as for lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.248" offset="280973">In this case there never was a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.924" offset="299677">The facts were, that on May 12, 1954, the Spanish ship, S. S. Guadalupe, came into Hoboken, New Jersey where it docked and Francisco Romero, a Spanish citizen and crew member of the S. S. Guadalupe, and employed by the owners of the S. S. Guadalupe who are the Compañía Transatlántica, was working on that ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.600" offset="466338">The particular facts of the accident will be more deeply gone into by Mr. Axtell.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.306" offset="497162">What happened was that they were engaged, that is, the crew members were engaged in topping this boom which is merely dropping the boom to bring on some lumber which was to be used as shipping boards to store grains.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.884" offset="567484">There was a great deal of confusion on the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.630" offset="578456">You had your Spanish seamen who spoke Spanish.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.591" offset="590263">You had your longshoremen who spoke English.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.975" offset="607817">You had also your carpenters.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.318" offset="641254">Francisco Romero was feeding this wire into this winch when the wire became snarled and as a result, his leg – his left leg was amputated and his right leg was fractured.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.439" offset="725682">He was rushed by ambulance with police sirens through Hoboken to St. Mary's Hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.370" offset="773433">There he was at the point of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.743" offset="786913">He was given the last rites and however, he lived.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.355" offset="829336">Soon after the accident, an action was started against the owners of the ship, the Spanish Line, Compañía Transatlántica, their agents, Garcia &amp; Diaz, and longshoreman International Terminal Operating Company Inc., and some time much later the carpenter company was brought into the case, Quin Lumber Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.435" offset="961724">So we have -- the picture was there were three American corporations that is International Terminal Operating, the Garcia &amp; Diaz, Quin Lumber Company, the Spanish Line of course is a Spanish corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.244" offset="1032882">The complaint was composed of four causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.555" offset="1070184">The first was a cause of action against both the Spanish Line and Garcia &amp; Diaz under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.923" offset="1119608">And the second cause was against the same two defendants for maintenance and cure and then there were third and fourth causes.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.331" offset="1161300">Third was cause of action against International Terminal Operating Company's negligence and also the same cause of action against Quin Lumber Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.993" offset="1215948">Mr. Romero stayed in the hospital a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.223" offset="1236846">The hospital bill mounted up to $3,750.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.371" offset="1265476">Payment was demanded by the hospital of Garcia &amp; Diaz, the agents of Spanish Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.493" offset="1293897">The payment has never been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.868" offset="1307376">Garcia &amp; Diaz has stated that they are prepared to pay only up to July 10; I do not know the exact date, and they want a bill for that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.024" offset="1351993">And they have received the bill, but it goes I believe to July 14, just few days more.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.872" offset="1379474">They had not paid for that bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.948" offset="1391700">The Spanish seaman received an artificial limb which cost $195 which has not been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.259" offset="1429002">There was $25 bill for the burial of the amputated part in the Catholic cemetery that has been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.817" offset="1471216">Case law on the calendar, we requested preferences and finally we did come to that point where the case was marked ready for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.667" offset="1526596">We appeared before Judge Sugarman who was to be the sitting judge at that trial with a jury and the demand for a jury had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.953" offset="1587722">On that morning a motion was made by the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.452" offset="1609770">The motion was to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.853" offset="1651357">In the brief of the Spanish Line they have stated there were two motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.914" offset="1679569">There was no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.018" offset="1684062">There was only one motion, and I would like to read that particular page in the transcript which appears on 194(a) where the court says.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.451" offset="1761802">The court; the court can proceed under the rule of sua sponte in the absence of jurisdiction in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.237" offset="1804852">However, so there will be no misunderstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.344" offset="1821362">I am presiding on the basis that each of the four defendants has moved orally which brought on this pretrial hearing for a dismissal of the complaint upon ground of lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.557" offset="1878204">Mr. Quinlan; that is right and yet in Mr. Quinlan's brief he stated there were two motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.831" offset="1919269">Judge Sugarman proceeded to try to obtain a stipulation as to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.448" offset="1957721">As he went along they got the citizenship of Mr. Romero, Spanish citizen, the Spanish Line and the other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.076" offset="2004219">But there came a point where the question of the management of the ship, the management and operation came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.352" offset="2049358">It was conceded that the Spanish Line ownership, but the plaintiffs contended that as far as management and operation it was a joint affair between the agents and the owner of the ship, Garcia &amp; Diaz and the Spanish Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.234" offset="2128875">On that point the judge took evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.547" offset="2154162">He had the deposition which had been taken out of the secretary to Garcia &amp; Diaz and he also received a contract between Garcia &amp; Diaz and -- the agency contract between Garcia &amp; Diaz and I believe a Cuban branch of Garcia and Diaz and the Spanish Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.636" offset="2238485">Then we continued on with the stipulation and the court came to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.381" offset="2265443">The seamen had signed a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.633" offset="2274429">On top of that contract it said, roundtrip voyage starts as Bilbao goes through New York, I think down to Mexico and ends when it gets back to Bilbao.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.693" offset="2338691">It was on the second trip -- there was the roundtrip and then he went out two trips more and on that second one was when this injury occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.846" offset="2391353">There no written extension of that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.495" offset="2413923">The judge took evidence on the point of whether the contract could be extended under the law and at that point, Mr. Quinlan called one of the lawyers who I believe is with the Spanish workmen's compensation administration in Spain, and the plaintiff called an expert on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.220" offset="2528862">Meanwhile, there had been repeated motions that the judge had no right to entertain – to hold this pretrial hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.422" offset="2601587">The judge apparently was a little -- he wondered about it, because in the transcript you will see that he asked several of the counsel if they had ever seen any or heard of any other procedure of this type for this kind of the thing and they said, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.560" offset="2686224">Then the motion was made.</text>

            <label>Mr. Narciso Puente, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="685.436" offset="2741708">Our objection is this that the plaintiff had pleaded the general maritime law and the Jones Act and upon his pleading that and providing it was not sham, the court had jurisdiction providing there had been no objection to a general appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.276" offset="2829061">I mean, if the defendants had put in a special appearance on that they appeared general, but once it got to that point, we had, so to speak, given the magic word, we pleaded the Jones Act and the general maritime law and we were qualified to have a trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1393.266" offset="5572963">I do not see where it was disturbance of the tranquility of the port in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1418.759" offset="5674945">But my last point, and I want to finish up is that I would I like to point out to the Court that in the Sieracki case the Court stated that the great humanitarian quality about, well, in that case it involved a longshoreman who sued under seaworthiness and the Court maintained that people in such hazardous occupations, the law protected them and it would be humanitarian about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.268" offset="5821022">Now here we have a case where we have pleaded on seaworthiness where we have seaman and we have the Jones Act which is to help seaman and are we to cut off an individual who come into Hoboken on his ship and he suffers this injury, are we going to cut off these humanitarian benefits from him?</text>

            <text syncTime="1677.707" offset="6710753">This wire runs through those blocks at the foot of the Samson post and at the top of the Samson post and out to the end of the boom, which of course you are very familiar from other cases where these accidents have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.105" offset="6788389">The fault that brings these American companies into it, the stevedoring people who were aboard and the Quin Lumber people, all of whom belonged to the ILA they call it, a union, the foremen or (Inaudible) called the bosun away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.528" offset="6874070">He was the superintendent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.505" offset="6882011">This winch was a good strong winch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.584" offset="6894237">There were no defectiveness that we know of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.017" offset="6908029">It was old type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.128" offset="6916493">It was built in Denmark about two years or about the time the ship was built.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.439" offset="6941675">Strong enough, big enough, but it has four men and this deck here which the spool is located and the drawing of the cargo in turn in the same direction at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.579" offset="7002279">There are no gears that can control them separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.005" offset="7024013">So when the bosun left his place where he was engaged in taking the slack wire that came from a cargo pull and he moved from there on request of the outsider, this man over here who was clearing the wire, Romero was holding here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.786" offset="7115128">This wire is described by Romero as very old and worn and very kinky that it would have been strange and its threads had been impaired so it did not evenly hold itself and would twist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.066" offset="7184196">And when this man left and this man jumped over here to take the cargo pull without any orders from anybody, the winch driver did not stop the winch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.814" offset="7227246">It kept it going and another wire came up here and hit the spool which caused it to lose its traction in spite of Romero's efforts and the boom fell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.289" offset="7293074">He tried to get out of the way, but his leg was carried in these two steel blocks here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.288" offset="7317107">They are shown at close abbreviation, this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.954" offset="7327765">This is a (Inaudible) in the deck that holds the lower one of those blocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.229" offset="7352842">This distance would be up as the boom would go down the toping lift would go up on the boom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.092" offset="7392340">So you can see that if this bosun, the Spanish Line were let out of this case on the ground that some ground that we would not go into and the men were relegated to a suit against the American companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.725" offset="7462870">When the case was tried the lawyer for the American companies would have to say, well, the real cause of this accident was the un-seaworthiness of the ship, because the wire was worn out.</text>
