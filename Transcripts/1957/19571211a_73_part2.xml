            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="4.328" offset="17241">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.330" offset="29257">By way of further answer to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question as to the legality of a dual rate formula used by a single carrier, let me refer to the first case arising before the Shipping Board as to dual rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.937" offset="111700">In 1922, the Eden Mining Company case which is cited and quoted and discussed starting at page 51 of the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.655" offset="158616">That case arose and was decided by the Board not under Section 14, since Section 14 was not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.252" offset="200934">That's a collective retaliation section but under Section 16 and 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.160" offset="224549">And the Board found that a dual rate formula, when used by a single carrier, is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.634" offset="254433">And the Board said that it is evident that the purpose of Congress in enacting these provisions of the statute was to impose upon common carriers within the purview thereof, the duty of charging uniform rates to all shippers we've seen in a similar transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.100" offset="320366">The Board went on to refer the leading I.C.C. case, the Western Union Telegraphic Company case, 181 U.S., reading from the bottom of the page, but that principle of equality does forbid any difference in charge which is not based on difference in service and even when based upon difference of service must have some reasonable relation to the amount of difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.890" offset="411481">Now, we have undertaken to meet the argument on the other side that there's been a consistent administrative construction of the Board here.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.702" offset="442723">The dual rate system is perfectly all right by showing as Judge Frank pointed out in his opinion for the three-judge District Court in the North Atlantic case.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.103" offset="480340">But the Board -- the Board which really of course represents four successive agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.447" offset="501760">First, the Shipping Board then the Secretary of Commerce then the Maritime Commission and now the Federal Maritime Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.773" offset="523076">Their decisions of every -- have gone every which way on this and it wasn't really until 1933, 17 years after the Shipping Act, you have the first case upholding a dual rate system when used by carriers.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="148.724" stopTime="150.125">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="148.724" offset="594860">What year was that did you say?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_elman" startTime="150.125" stopTime="591.405">
            <label>Mr. Philip Elman</label>
            <text syncTime="150.125" offset="600398">1933.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.271" offset="604996">That's the Rowley case which is discussed in our brief immediately after the Eden case.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.912" offset="627566">That's the secondary case.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.240" offset="632895">That -- that is 1933, 17 years after the Act, far from a contemporaneous interpretation, inconsistent with the Eden case which I've mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.576" offset="674273">Now, I have -- I said at the outset that we -- we regard the order of the Board here which is under a -- which is what's on the review as being infected with areas of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.905" offset="727562">We think that the Board applied an erroneous standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.853" offset="739370">The Board here conceded that the dual rate system was discriminatory, that it was monopolistic, conceded that it was -- its purpose was anti-competitive to eliminate an independent -- from business or to join a con -- conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.783" offset="799033">The Board nevertheless said, those -- that discrimination, that monopolistic feature is outweighed by the fact that it produces rate stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.067" offset="844173">It eliminates competition among carriers as to rates and stability of rate is a good thing and it's a justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.651" offset="874580">Now, we find on our reading of the statute and our reading of the committee report that while Congress was concerned with rate stability and was anxious to maintain rate stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.773" offset="931004">It didn't make an absolute dogma of rate stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.562" offset="942184">It permitted the Board in considering whether to approve conference agreements under Section 15, to consider whether such an agreement would be desirable, would produce stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.747" offset="998922">But that was an agreement among the carriers themselves as to what each one of them was charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.636" offset="1026508">And -- and Congress has said “Yes, the Board has the power to permit this car -- conference carriers to form an association among themselves so they can fix their own rate, they can eliminate rate competition among each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.264" offset="1076976">You can have stability to that extent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="271.786" offset="1087112">But Congress didn't stop with Section 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.230" offset="1104875">Congress put in the statute, Section 14 and Section 16 and 17 -- 16 and 17 which are on -- in the appendix to our brief 60 -- pages 65 and 66, those provisions are taken from the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.739" offset="1166942">As this Court pointed out in the Cunard case and the Swayne &amp; Hoyt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.853" offset="1183347">Congress permitted the Board to suspend pro tanto the antitrust laws to the extent that it could approve these conference agreements fixing rates among themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.139" offset="1236532">But congress went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.977" offset="1243847">It subjected these conferences to the -- the restrictions of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.280" offset="1269029">That was done in 16 and 17, 16 and 17 says that there shall be no discrimination between shippers, that's the consequence of dual rate system.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.191" offset="1300689">But specifically, Congress didn't even stop with 16 and 17, Congress put in Section 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.051" offset="1328170">Section 14 is cashed in terms of outright prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.291" offset="1345097">It prohibits in Section first the deferred rate -- rebate system.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.914" offset="1363592">Now, the deferred rebate system was the system which was then widely used prior to 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.680" offset="1390655">That was the system for eliminating competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.279" offset="1401104">That was the system for producing rate stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.426" offset="1413642">That was the system that would prevent rate wars to the extent that it was effective, you have a complete destruction, elimination of independent competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.886" offset="1447497">Congress said “No, you --” to the Board, “you can't approve that because in Section 15 the grant of power to the Board to approve conference agreements is specifically limited.”</text>
            <text syncTime="371.543" offset="1486158">The Board is given no power to approve any agreement which is that it -- which is unjustly discriminatory unfair as between carriers which operates the detrimental commerce of the United States or in violation of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.763" offset="1543001">And to find out whether it's in violation of the Act, you look to the whole Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.800" offset="1555122">Not just Section 15, you look at 14 as well as 16 and 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.924" offset="1571631">And if a -- if an agreement is in violation of Section 14, the Board has no power to approve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.159" offset="1592633">Now, Section 14, Second -- prohibits a fighting ship, again a fighting ship is a device to deal with competition of independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.853" offset="1627324">It produces rate stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.886" offset="1635474">But certainly, if the Federal Maritime Board could not enter an order today saying that a fighting ship or a deferred rebate or the specific restraint mentioned in 14 Third, a refusal or a threat -- or a threat of refuse of space accommodations, suppose it -- suppose a conference came to the Board and offered to setup a system providing further deferred rebate, fighting ship or refusal of space accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.306" offset="1741218">Could the Board use as the standard of law under Section 14, the proposition?</text>
            <text syncTime="440.627" offset="1762429">Well, this will produce rate stability and we think that in this industry, competition isn't a good thing and therefore we will permit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.318" offset="1797224">The answer is Section 14 precludes the Board from taking in to consideration that standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.596" offset="1822302">It's a standard for approving agreements among the conference -- conference carriers themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.123" offset="1844454">They can fix rates among each other but they can't -- they can't agree also that they will go after an independent carrier who wishes to stay outside the conference and drive them in to the conference or drive them out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.892" offset="1907566">Now, Section 14 Third which has been the main provision in this case, prohibits retaliation against any shipper by refusing or threatening to refuse space accommodation when such are available, specific or resort to other discriminating or unfair methods.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.926" offset="1987605">Now, Congress specifically outlawed these three things that were unused -- used then, but it didn't stop there, it flatly, sweepingly then every discriminating or unfair method which was used because such shipper has patronized any other carrier or has filed a complaint charging unfair treatment or for any other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.486" offset="2073913">So you have two catchall clauses here.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.183" offset="2084676">You've got a catchall clause condemning every method which is unfair and discriminating which is used to retaliate against the shippers who reserve the right to patronize carriers and retaliation is not merely for patronizing another carrier but for any other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.164" offset="2164611">Now, the Board has construed Section 14 and that -- and these errors of law light the very threshold of it's -- of its report.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.584" offset="2194286">The Board has construed Section 14 as if these two catchall clauses weren't in there at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.624" offset="2214452">I refer specifically to page 52 of its report where the Board said -- after referring to the Swayne &amp; Hoyt case and to the legislative material, Mr. Gardner has referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.747" offset="2278922">The Board says in -- in support of the view that Congress intended in the Act to prohibit only those practices specifically condemned, we offer the following testimony of a witness on another bill which did not become a Shipping Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.791" offset="2339109">The -- the Board expresses the view that Section 14 Third covers only the specific practices and if I may finish the sentence Mr. --</text>

            <text syncTime="592.775" offset="2371082">In page 58 -- in page 58 of its report, referring to the meaning of the word “retaliation” and this is in the question of administrative expertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.098" offset="2416327">The Board has no greater insight into the meaning of these words than others have.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.198" offset="2440777">The Board says the word -- quoting and relying on its prior opinion in the North Atlantic Freight Conference case, which was a case that came here in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.206" offset="2488738">The Board adopts the view -- that the higher rate cannot be said to be charged as a retaliation for patronizing any other carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.622" offset="2530429">It is charged because the shipper does not sign the contract regardless of whether or not he patronizes any other carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.611" offset="2558433">A non-signing shipper who does not patronize a north conference carrier is treated as harshly as a non-signing shipper who ships partially and exclusively with such a carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.633" offset="2594482">In other words, the -- or for any other reason, is -- is not given any concern of this -- of the 50 pages of this report, more than 32 pages are devoted to discussion of law, discussion of Swayne &amp; Hoyt case in which the Board takes out of context the footnote by Mr. Justice Stone referring to legislative history giving it a meaning it doesn't bare.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.154" offset="2692598">The Board has not quoted the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.014" offset="2703987">We think that there's an error of law in leaving out of its consideration of these two catchall clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.154" offset="2728542">Under the Board's construction if there were a flat refusal by conference carriers to -- of space accommodations specifically outlawed under 14 Third.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.215" offset="2772846">Nevertheless, it would be a violation of the statute if the refusal was not for patronizing another carrier but because they merely reserve the right to do so by failing to enter into an exclusive patronage of payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.167" offset="2816627">That we say is an error of law requiring reversal of the Board's order.</text>
