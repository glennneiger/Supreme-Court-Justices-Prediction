            <text syncTime="33.384" offset="133433">The issue in this case and in the next case which follows is whether when a person dies leaving an estate which is insufficient to meet income taxes which he incurred while alive, whether the United States can recover and collect from the beneficiaries of his life insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.319" offset="241267">Now, this question can be further divided into whether the beneficiary, if liable at all, is liable to the full extent of the receipts from the insurance company or whether it might -- the beneficiary might be limited in liability to the cash surrender value of the policies which the insured might have reduced the possession during his life.</text>

            <text syncTime="116.056" offset="464144">That is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.586" offset="466338">That's one of the basic problems in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.965" offset="487758">Now, the facts in this case are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.495" offset="497894">After Dr. Stern died in 1949, they discovered that he had been cheating on his income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.863" offset="535406">A substantial liability including fraud penalties was adjudicated against him in the Tax Court and the amount of that liability is not in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.949" offset="587755">At the time of his death, Dr. Stern had enforced 17 life insurance policies which had accumulated a substantial cash surrender values.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.781" offset="643030">His wife was named as beneficiary in each one of these insurance policies, but Dr. Stern has retained the right to assign the policies, to change the beneficiary, to borrow against the cash surrender value or to surrender the policies entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.320" offset="725264">Since they were insufficient assets in Dr. Stern's estate to meet his income taxes, the United States attempted to collect these taxes from the beneficiary of his life -- of his life insurance on the ground that she was an assignee, a transferee of these -- of this property from him and that since it was assigned to her without consideration when the taxes couldn't be paid that the United States was entitled to follow these assets in different hands.</text>

            <label>Mr. John F. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="219.064" offset="876251">I think we can assume that he was, at least the United States has not proved that he wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.476" offset="893806">So, the purposes of this case, it can be assumed he was so.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.623" offset="918465">Mrs. Stern submitted the question of her liability to the Tax Court and the Tax Court found that she was liable up to the full amount of the insurance benefits that she had received.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.327" offset="977293">She then appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and the Sixth Circuit reversed the Tax Court on the ground that a widow is not a transferee with respect to insurance policies and in addition, that under Kentucky law, a widow, a beneficiary of insurance cannot be liable for her husband's death.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.307" offset="1081156">Since this decision was in conflict, at least in part with the case of United States against Bess which was decided in the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.510" offset="1117936">The United States petitioned for certiorari and that's why we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.735" offset="1142909">Now, just a word about the nature of these policies that were involved, there were 17 of them and they were not termed insurance which is pure insurance in the sense that there is no savings element in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.181" offset="1196722">These were ordinary life insurance policies under which the insured pays a amount in excess of the pure insurance cost during the early years of the policy and a reserved accumulates which he, under his insurance contract, is entitled to borrow against or in case he surrenders the policy, he's entitled to withdraw the cash surrender value in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.425" offset="1317616">Now, also with -- with respect to these policies, the insured retain full control to change the beneficiary at any time up to his death or to assign the policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.019" offset="1428062">Premiums were paid up until the time -- were paid by Dr. Stern up to the time of his death.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.124" offset="1460454">Now, the courts have reached diverse results in cases on substantially similar cases -- similar facts to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.988" offset="1495876">The Tax Court has uniformly held that the beneficiary of such insurance is liable to the -- to the full amount of the principal amount of the insurance paid to the beneficiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.436" offset="1549688">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has held that the beneficiary is liable but only to the extent of a cash surrender value of the policies which the insured could have reduced the possession during his life time.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.327" offset="1609247">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has held that there is, in fact, a transfer from the insured to the beneficiary of a cash surrender value, but it's held that the beneficiary is not liable because liability is governed by New York law and under New York law, the insurance goes to the beneficiary free and clear of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.748" offset="1706945">The Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Circuits have held that the insurance beneficiary is under no liability to the Government at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.412" offset="1749577">Now, basically, the results in these cases do not rest upon any particular language in the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.964" offset="1783850">This particular action was brought under a Section called Section 311 of the 1939 Code which is merely a Section which provides for the procedure of collecting a liability against the transferee.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.873" offset="1847484">It is uniformly agreed in the cases that Section 311 does not itself establish the liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.123" offset="1876428">The basis for the Government's claim in these cases is the so-called trust fund doctrine and that in very simple words is, that when a debtor transfers part of his assets to a third person without consideration at a time when he is insolvent or when this transfer will -- a transfer will make him insolvent that the creditor can follow those assets into the hands of the transferee.</text>
