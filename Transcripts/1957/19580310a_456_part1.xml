            <label>Mr. Harry Kisloff</label>
            <text syncTime="14.812" offset="59246">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.368" offset="69381">This is a Jones Act suit whose over mastering purpose is to afford a seaman injured in the cause of his employment and indemnity remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.195" offset="120686">The dispositive issue in this case is whether or not the petitioner was a member of the crew of some vessel within the meaning of the exclusionary clause of the Defense Bases Act, that Section 1654.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.446" offset="181708">This involves not merely a tally of the evidence, taken in a light most favorable to the petitioner in view of the fact that there was a directed verdict from the District Court but it also involves a question of construction of congressional legislation with legislative history and Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.698" offset="262792">The facts are that the respondent entered into a contract with the United States government to receive a complete Texas Tower afloat at East Boston and to tow it to Georges Banks, high seas to elevate it and to install it and to complete all fabrication as necessary in accordance with plans and specifications submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.427" offset="365610">In order to perform its contract, the respondent went about to gather materials, men and boats to perform this job and then went directly to the Pile Drivers Union because the man in that union possessed the required skills for doing all kinds of maritime tasks.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.140" offset="428513">It then went about and chartered with rules, two tugs and chartered without rules, two barges, intending to take personnel from off the tower and use them to men these barges when they arrive at the tower with supplies because the barges have to be anchored in close proximity to the tower so that the supplies would be removed from the barge to the tower.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.649" offset="526524">The plaintiff joined this craft at East Boston where he did maritime work readying him to sea, taking aboard supplies, lashing them, storing them, securing them and did some work upon the case on at sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.611" offset="582426">He then went with this boat and a group of 25 and all consisting of various types of workmen and he made up the bridals that secured the lines from the tower to the tug and then he watched the lines and he also made up or assisted in making up a bulkhead to prevent boarding seas from coming over the tower.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.935" offset="675736">When the tower arrived at its site, he performed maritime tasks to anchor the tower which was to handle windlasses.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.085" offset="704261">And then when the tower -- after the tower was anchored, he then performed some tasks to assist in getting the tower elevated and that required him to go over the site of the tower under very hazardous conditions with seas breaking over him.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.272" offset="773016">When the first barge arrived with supplies for the tower, he was ordered along with several -- with eight others to leave the barge and board that tower and he did so under perilous conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.531" offset="818051">He had to leave the tower via a cargo net in rough seas and then after being transported to the barge, he worked for a period of some six hours doing work at a purely strictly maritime nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.404" offset="869564">And then he left the tower, got onto a tug and then, as the weather became more mirky, and the sea more rough, they took out a contraption that was rigged from -- direct on the tower and he boarded that contraption from a tug and no sooner that he leave the contraption that it hit the overhang of the -- of the tug and he received his injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.577" offset="962247">The court below made a policy decision, wherein it excluded all Texas Tower workers from the operation of the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.519" offset="1006028">They ruled them all out.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.354" offset="1013342">Contrary to clerk announcements of this Court both with respect to the rule relating to the submission of such an issue to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.909" offset="1051585">And also, contrary to the decisions of this Court relating to the policy of bringing in under the Jones Act such maritime workers as Congress did not clearly exclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.504" offset="1094008">The plaintiff's first contention, assuming for the moment that these words, “member of the crew” have the same meaning as the exact similar words in the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act assumed that they have that identical meaning then this plaintiff contends that there was a factual question as to whether or not he was a crew member of this barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.125" offset="1180421">The barge was undoubtedly a vessel, she have no crew, if he was not one of its crew then who were its crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.691" offset="1210723">His work was strictly of a maritime nature far different than any kind of work that dredge man do upon dredges and they have been held to be crew members on -- at least on a factual question.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.878" offset="1267461">Now, actually he wasn't --</text>

            <text syncTime="329.640" offset="1318557">In other words, his work aboard the tower as a crew men required him to go and to leave under hazardous and perilous conditions of the sea and it was that activity that produced his injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="355.499" offset="1421897">Is that your point?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_kisloff" startTime="356.681" stopTime="810.353">
            <label>Mr. Harry Kisloff</label>
            <text syncTime="356.681" offset="1426704">It was that activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.001" offset="1431928">The trial judge considered that it was his activity at the time that controlled his status and as a matter of fact, he thought his status aboard the tower was very interesting but not material.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.997" offset="1475918">And he followed a decision of this Court in O'Rourke against the Pennsylvania Railroad, where O'Rourke who was essentially a railroad man was considered a harbor worker in view of the fact that he happened to be on the top float at the time his injury occurred and that this Court so ruled as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.324" offset="1549270">Following that decision, the trial judge considered him a crew member of the barge but the trial judge directed his attention to Section 1651, forgetting that there were other Sections such as 1654.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.664" offset="1606635">And he thought, that no crew member of the barge could recover under the Jones Act if the work that he did was preparatory and ancillary to the work upon the tower because he said, that any exclusionary clause had to be derivative to the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.856" offset="1671419">And he came up with the thought that because of the broad language of Section 1651, negative, any -- any incorporation into the Defense Bases Act of the exclusion clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.974" offset="1719798">In other words, all Congress intended to include was the compensation features of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.831" offset="1755324">The judge made an error of oversight but the Circuit Court of Appeals held that this man was no crew member of the barge because even if injured on the barge because they said his work was of a temporary nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.464" offset="1825855">And that suggests that ship owners can avoid the measure of their responsibility to crew members by a device of temporary crew members.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.239" offset="1868904">And this Court has in the case of Seas Shipping -- Sieracki against Seas Shipping Company passed on one aspect of that question when the Court said that a ship owner owes to longshoreman, a duty to provide a seaworthy vessel because the longshoreman does the work of a crew member.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.474" offset="1941838">In other words, he could delegate the work but never the responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.980" offset="1955840">Those men who do the work and take the risks should be afforded the same relief as regular crew members.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.011" offset="1988023">So that, taking this case even in its narrow aspect, Congress intended to afford to such persons who do strictly maritime work upon a strict vessel, the same relief because they endure the same peril, they do the same work and their need is just as great.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.967" offset="2067853">Now, apart from -- apart from that the petitioner contends in the alternative that there was a factual question, as to whether or not this man was a member of the crew of the tower.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.761" offset="2135040">Having in mind that he had a permanent connection with the tower, having in mind that at that time this accident occurred, the tower was merely in the process of being elevated and it had not lost its character as a -- as a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.501" offset="2190002">The distinction, Congress intended to give an indemnity remedy for those persons who do the work of crew members take their risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.891" offset="2235559">And the shape of the vessel should not determine the -- the remedy that a man is entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.841" offset="2267324">If were -- if one were to go through the three cases that this Court has -- the two cases of this Court has passed upon, one was -- is the Gianfala case where the barge was sunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.252" offset="2312986">Certainly, it was temporarily withdrawn from navigation, yet apparently, the man who did the work upon that thing and do the risks that men endure, that crew members endure.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.070" offset="2368261">And then, if you were to analyze the Senko case and say, well in that case the vessel was merely a “tie by lines”, what difference does it make if the vessel was nailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.160" offset="2416640">He got this thing out on the high seas and you have these men subjected to all the perils and all the dangers of the sea and they do the identical work of crew members.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.455" offset="2473796">I have also argued in my brief that as a matter of fact, the Defense Bases Act does not restrict the application of the Jones Act one bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.778" offset="2511099">Although, the Defense Bases Act uses the identical words of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, yet in fact it does not restrict the application of the Jones Act to any seaman because in that very act, it has incorporated the provisions of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.045" offset="2584137">In that Act, Congress intended that only longshoremen and harbor workers working within the territorial waters of the United States should have a compensation remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.744" offset="2626873">That Act is a restricted Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.543" offset="2634083">It does not apply to any longshoremen or any harbor workers working beyond the territorial waters of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.538" offset="2662087">That Act was incorporated into the Defense Bases Act so that the only thing left is whether the broad language of Section 1651 negatives or shows an intention upon the part of Congress to pass a Compensation Act for a segment of seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.327" offset="2729273">And nowhere in the legislative history of the Defense Bases Act is there any indication that Congress intended to pass a Compensation Act for any segment of seaman.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.391" offset="2773473">That broad language got in as an Amendment because after the Act was apparently drafted, there was a loophole in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.983" offset="2803879">The original Act provided for accidents on bases and left alone accidents off bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.866" offset="2827389">So, in order to take care of the loophole that there was in the law, Congress then went on and use very broad language indicating that they were covering up this loopholes, so not only did it cover accidents on base but it covered accidents off base.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.120" offset="2888411">And also, the mere words, “members of the crew” because they happen to be identical with the mere words of “members of the crew” as used of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act is not indicative that Congress intended to pass a Compensation Act for any segment of seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.032" offset="2968033">And having in mind the policy of this Court to bring within the hold of the Jones Act, all maritime workers who are not clearly excluded, there isn't anything in that Defense Bases Act that shows that Congress intended to -- to exclude a segment of maritime workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.617" offset="3038459">Finally, the last argument that has been made that where a man is put in a position where he is in doubt as to which Act he falls under, the choice of the remedy should be his because of the over mastering purpose of the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.144" offset="3100526">Now, my brother relies upon a definition of member of a vessel, meaning, a craft or any matter of craft used or capable of being used in navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.109" offset="3148382">That definition is inclusive but not -- but not -- it doesn't exclude other definitions, it's an inclusive definition but not a definition that is a limitation of other classes.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.012" offset="3208046">I believe I'm covered, sorry.</text>

            <text syncTime="824.847" offset="3299370">The Texas Tower that's involved in this litigation may it please the Court, is an artificial structure, three photographs which are contained in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.374" offset="3341479">It's located something over hundred miles beyond Cape Cod on the Georges Bank and was specially designed to constitute a warning base, a radar warning base sufficiently out to sea, so that our land based aircraft defenses might possibly have the time to intercept an enemy aircraft invader.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.971" offset="3459866">My brother has argued to you in part of this argument that this unusual structure of which there are now several and others are going up in all parts of the world wherever we have bases, is and was advancing toward the reasons that after it was constructed by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation for the United States Navy on contract with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.186" offset="3592673">It was told from the Bethlehem Yards, in East Boston in Boston Harbor, 110 miles out of sea by Cod to the place that had been selected by the Airforce as the proper place to establish this artificial island.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.119" offset="3676473">And a picture of the -- the structure being told is also contained in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.292" offset="3705104">The plaintiff was engaged from the Pile Drivers Union, it does work on this structure for the sake of helping get it directed at its permanent side of the Georges Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.060" offset="3780232">He was engaged from that particular union for a fairly sound reason because in that union they have the men who had the skills for the erection of structures in water, in maritime waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.202" offset="3844807">He went to work at the East Boston Yards and work there for three weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.864" offset="3859435">And before the tug came to tow the structure out to sea, he signed a contract, plaintiff, which is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.467" offset="3917845">He went with the structure out to sea and when it arrived at the permanent site on the 12th of July in 1955, immediately went to work to get the structure elevated out of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.424" offset="3973642">And one of the exhibits, the photograph shows the structure out of the water either 20 feet above the high water mark, as the plaintiff testified or 60 feet above the high water mark as other witnesses testified but in any event forever out of the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.321" offset="4073221">The structure was lifted out of the water according to the indisputable testimony, the day after it arrived at the site.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.705" offset="4098717">It was lifted out of the water on the 12th of July.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.388" offset="6481502">The Jones Act was passed in 1920 for now, perfectly clear on obvious reasons and very salutary ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.584" offset="6514312">The Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act was passed in 1937 and this Court indicated, that the passage of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act changed the meaning of the word “seaman” in the Jones Act and thenceforth confined it to members of a crew of any vessel and came a decision which indicated that masters are entitled to the very same protection as members of crew and lump them all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.441" offset="6637714">We were approaching the war in 1940, the Lease Lend Act had gone into effect and the nation was preparing for the inevitable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1681.041" offset="6724127">The Court will recall that we started with Bermuda and some of the other islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.894" offset="6747533">Congress passed an Act incidentally, very vigorously sponsored by Senator Pepper in order to induce skilled American workers to go out into those hazardous areas and that was in 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.786" offset="6815138">And build our defense bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.932" offset="6823706">And then came Pearl Harbor, we're at war and the Act was found to be insufficient, so the Congress went ahead and passed the Defense Bases Act which is amended to the 1940 Act in December 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.321" offset="6885251">And the purpose of it from the Congressional debates, some of which I have brought to the Court's attention in my brief were to make certain that we got our bases built and that workers who were hurt or killed would have quick sure certain protection for themselves and their families.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.920" offset="6983680">I don't suppose this Court took certiorari of what is essentially a case of very minor personal injuries in order to decide the merits in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.066" offset="7032163">It seems to be now that in light of the overpowering purposes of the Defense Bases Act and the fact that we are enlarging our defense bases all over the world that this Court may take this case as the opportunity to instruct the bar and the lower federal courts, as to what standards to use in the determination or whether or not there is sufficient evidence to decide whether a person who comes in to Court as a plaintiff is a member of a crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.593" offset="7186286">And if a Court can determine that on standards laid down by this Court to intelligently instruct the jury so that a jury of untrained layman and apply some standards and determine whether a claimant is or is not a member of a crew of a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.592" offset="7270296">And just as in the negligence cases, to which allusion was made in the majority opinion of the Senko case if the evidence is not sufficient, just as I sincerely believe that it is not sufficient here, a Court is to direct a verdict and where it is sufficient the findings of the trier of facts whether it would be a commissioner as it was in the Bassett case or a jury as its been in so many other cases, should stand whether or not the appellate court likes the result.</text>

            <text syncTime="1895.613" offset="7582407">Judge Wyzanski, stated that under the Defenses Bases Act, having in mind the particular provision of that statue with talks of work preparatory and ancillary to the main provision that this man could not recover under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.958" offset="7659729">He went on to say that if this man worked for another employer, he might be considered a member of a crew of a vessel and that language at first flash maybe misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.297" offset="7713123">If this man, as I understand Judge Wyzanski's position, worked for a navigation company and his employment was to work on the barge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.000" offset="7759935">He would be a member of a crew of a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.300" offset="7773100">My brother's point however was, that Judge Wyzanski didn't observed the exclusion of the Defense Bases Act which excludes from its coverage masters and members of a crew of a vessel but relied on the identical exclusion in the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.914" offset="7843631">Well, I don't believe for a minute that Judge Wyzanski overlooked the exclusion in the Defense Bases Act nor does it make any difference whether he did or not because the exclusion in each of the two statutes are absolutely identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.983" offset="7899847">And if he had overlooked them both, it wouldn't make any difference because where the Court's ruling is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.849" offset="7927327">This Court has never considered itself bound by the Court's reasons even if they did wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="2037.509" offset="8149995">We observed the dissenting opinion was printed first then came the per curiam opinion of the Court of Appeals by Chief Judge Magruder and Justice Woodbury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.510" offset="8185940">The court of -- the majority of the Court of Appeals held pretty clearly, that on no construction of the facts whatsoever could this man be considered to be a member of a crew of any vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.873" offset="8243409">And the Court start its opinion with some such language as to indicate that it will be a perfectly futile act, to send it back to -- for jury to termination on the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.045" offset="8296176">Well, as I indicated before, may it please the Court, I'd also boast for a minuted that this Court was interested in this case purely because the special facts of this case except as those special facts give the Court an opportunity which would be extremely salutary and very helpful to the bar and the courts to state the principles that are to govern the determination by trial judges, by juries and by Courts of Appeals of who is and who is not a member of the crew of any vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.704" offset="8454792">It is a fact that some of the cases have indicated that some over emphasis should be made on what the individuals doing at the moment he was hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.406" offset="8505574">And other cases have indicated that it makes no difference whatever, where he was or what he was doing at the moment he was hurt but it depends upon whether or not he had a permanent connection with a vessel, as defined by this Court, which is not a structure like a Texas Tower, not even a floating dry dock but a vessel in its true sense.</text>
