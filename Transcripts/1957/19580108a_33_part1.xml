            <label>Mr. Robert W. Kenny</label>
            <text syncTime="21.951" offset="87771">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.803" offset="99161">The petitioners had planned to divide their argument and my purpose would keep the -- me to discuss the facts in the record, the procedural steps that brought us to this Court and then my colleague, Mr. Margolis will discuss the constitutional and legal questions that are applicable to them.This case involves the black list in the entertainment industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.956" offset="191739">This black list is now over 10 years old and it's still in existence today.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.563" offset="214204">And because of it, men and women are still excluded from callings to which they haven't devoted their entire professional lives and careers.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.238" offset="260911">The existence of this black list is admitted by the pleadings.No judicial relief, however, either by injunctions or by damages has ever yet been given to the victims of what is conceded on the pleadings to be the concerted action of a monopolistic group that controls all of the employment opportunities in this particular industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.436" offset="369685">We have never even had a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.273" offset="376999">And on the pleadings, this is a -- this is a case of a complete monopoly of both the production and the distribution of motion pictures and of all employment opportunities in that industry in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.523" offset="450038">American history, I believe, has very few parallels to such a situation as continues to exist in the motion picture industry today.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.290" offset="489117">The facts alleged in the petitioner's complaint are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.911" offset="507611">There are 23 petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.658" offset="518583">They are actors and actresses and writers and research workers and backlot workers, one classified as a grip.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.053" offset="560170">At the time they filed their complaint in the state court of California in March 1953, these petitioners had each, from five to 25 years, of experience in their professions.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.431" offset="613669">And many of them had acquired reputations, national reputations for excellence of work in the motion-picture industry and at one high esteem professionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.078" offset="660271">The respondents, that is the industry respondents, are the motion-picture distributors and producers of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.492" offset="697887">Between them, they control all of the production and distribution of motion pictures and they control, as I've said, all employment industries for all employees in the motion-picture industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.431" offset="753685">Two of the remaining respondents are members of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, and the third is an investigator employed by that Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.370" offset="793391">The complaint alleges that these respondents acted both officially and unofficially.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.074" offset="824216">The agreement of the respondents is that prior to March of 1951, and we alleged the agreement was made, they agreed first to exclude from employment in the motion-picture industry all persons who sought employment who had been subpoenaed as witnesses before the House Committee and who relied on their federal constitutional privileges including the Fifth Amendment to answer questions that pertain to their political affiliations and associations or beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.655" offset="954619">18 of the petitioners fall under this category.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.644" offset="974576">Second part of the agreement was among the respondents that they would exclude from employment in the industry all persons who had been named as communists but who had failed to appear voluntarily before the Committee and upon such voluntary appearance submit to committee inquiries without asserting their constitutional privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.365" offset="1069453">And five of the petitioners fall within this group.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.642" offset="1090560">Furthermore, this agreement among the respondents was that they would persuade all other employers in the industry to desist and refrain from employing all such persons with the intent of preventing them from obtaining any employment in the motion-picture industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.726" offset="1162867">Then as one of the means of effectuating this agreement, all of the respondents published and circulated throughout the entire industry a list which contained the names of all such employment, the employees who came within these two categories with the direction and intent that they'd not be employed and the publication and circulation of such a list continues today.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.287" offset="1269133">While alleges that the purpose of the agreement was first, to limit control and direct the political activities of all employees of the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.921" offset="1315631">And second, to coerce and influence in the motion-picture industry all employees by threat of loss of employment and thereby to coerce them to refrain for -- from adopting or following any political action or relying which was not acceptable to the House Un-American Activities Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.917" offset="1411657">And third -- the third purpose was to limit employment to those persons whose political believes were acceptable to that Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.045" offset="1444153">And fourth, to limit the production of motion pictures by the industry to those the conduct -- the content of which was acceptable to the House Un-American Activities Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.992" offset="1507892">When it states that the defendants and each of them by this conduct wrongfully, maliciously and without justification have interfered with and injured the right of said employees and other persons reasonably to expect employment in the motion-picture industry and to pursue their professions and occupations therein and it prevented their employment there.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.166" offset="1600575">The -- as I said, the complaint was for injunctive relief and for money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.801" offset="1627115">Thus, in the original complaint, the petitioners sought enforcement of three federal rights by the California state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.596" offset="1666299">These were, first, the right to pursue their chosen callings in the industry, second, their right to attend as witnesses in a federal forum and to invoke there their federal constitutional privileges, and third, their rights to freedom of speech and press an assembly to be exercised free from coercion and interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.211" offset="1768803">Now, the pleadings in the state court conform to the California rule that ultimate facts only can be pleaded and that references to statutes and constitutional provisions and principles of law are not properly part of the pleadings themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.251" offset="1840901">The respondents demurred generally to the original complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.806" offset="1867128">And in California as elsewhere, a demurrer admits the truth of all facts that are properly pleaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.882" offset="1891474">The trial judge in the law and motion department of the Superior Court there in Los Angeles sustained these general demurrers up to the original complaint and a minute order which gave no indication of the grounds and had no opinion but gave his leave to amend.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.032" offset="1964095">And since the demurrer was impart based upon the ground that the words "black list" and "conspiracy" were conclusions of law, we amended omitting the use of those words but otherwise, the amended complaint was identical with the original complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.563" offset="2034207">And there, the respondents again demurred generally to the amended complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.399" offset="2057509">This time, the trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.246" offset="2084885">However, this time, the trial court rendered a written opinion, which is part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.325" offset="2113202">I point out that despite the arguments that the respondents had made to the trial court despite those and contrary to them, the trial court held that we, the petitioners, did have a standing to sue in the Court for an invasion of our right to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.089" offset="2188330">And the trial court, in its opinion, recognized that we were asserting a right to pursue as petitioners, the -- their chosen professions to attend as witnesses in a federal form and to evoke their federal constitutional privileges without losing their right to work and their rights to freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.573" offset="2274220">However, the trial court did sustain the demurrers upon the ground that the burden was upon the petitioners to plead a lack of justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.144" offset="2324480">And they were required to -- the court rule, that we were to plead a lack of justification for the acts of the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.671" offset="2354678">And the trial court held that the terms of the agreement, with respect to the invocation of constitutional privileges and its purpose of limiting the political beliefs of the employees and of restricting the content of motion-picture, trial court had held that all of that did not show, as a matter of law, a lack of justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.046" offset="2440150">And in the trial court's written opinion, it was discussed, it was discussed first the relationship of the right to work, to due process and to the privileges of -- and immunities of citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.464" offset="2493753">And we say that this is the constitutional case which permeates the entire -- it is the constitutional point that permanetes the entire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.599" offset="2526354">Second, the trial court, in its opinion, discussed the -- state the Fifth Amendment and the duty of the State to protect against private action directed out of its exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.394" offset="2577554">We say that these are the questions obviously arising under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.450" offset="2601796">Third, the trial court held that since the State Government could fire employees who were claiming the Fifth Amendment, this, I might say, was written before this Court's decision in Slochower, the Court said, "Well, since the State can fire employees and take the Fifth Amendment, a reason from that that private employers have the same rights."</text>
            <text syncTime="673.600" offset="2694374">And fourth, the trial court opinion contained a likely discussion of -- of free speech, political sense, association, the censorship, allegations of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.104" offset="2740349">But it held that a private combination of private employers which act -- acted to suppress these rights was not unlawful.So the trial court sustained, as I say, the general demurrers without leave to amend and this made an entry of the judgment of dismissal mandatory and a judgment of dismissal so entered is final and appealable.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.850" offset="2843376">And we appeal, we appeal to the District Court of Appeals, which is the intermediate Court of Appeals in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.260" offset="2872947">And in that appeal, we urge that the judgment of dismissal, which held the petitioners to be without any remedy at all, that that judgment had deprived the petitioners of their liberties and properties without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.658" offset="2958629">We urge that the monopolistic combination of the respondents had deprived the petitioners of their fundamental right to work for a living.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.134" offset="3004500">We urge that the combination of respondents had arrogated powers that were denied the Government itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.958" offset="3035742">Fourth, that the conduct of the witnesses before the Committee and their exercise of constitutional privileges, including the one against self-incrimination, did not justify this concerted agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.869" offset="3087464">And we finally urged that the respondents had invaded rights secured by the constitutional laws of the United States and that the purpose of the conspiracy was patently violative of the freedom of speech and press and assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.101" offset="3160398">The District Court had appealed and handed down its opinion which completely disregarded the reasoning of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.193" offset="3200731">And the trial court's reasoning was that the justification was not a matter -- it was not a matter of defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.559" offset="3222152">It was a matter that we had to overcome affirmatively by our own pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.749" offset="3238975">The District Court of Appeals disregarded that and instead, the District Court of Appeal, for the first time since the inception of these proceedings, held that the complaint was insufficient because it had failed to allege any existing contract or any prospect of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.673" offset="3314625">And the appellate court went on to say that in view of that conclusion, it didn't reach any of the other part -- points that have been urged by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.698" offset="3354749">So I say this was the first time that the state courts have ruled in favor of the respondents' argument that the petitioners could not prevail unless they were able to plead a right based on a specific contract or the prospect of one.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.019" offset="3427997">The petitioners then filed a petition for rehearing in the District Court of Appeal in which we again argued that the appellate court had denied us the equal protection of law and deprived us of property without due process when it had held that we had no legal regrets against admitted wrongdoers who would deprive them admittedly of their right to pursue their chosen avocations merely because the petitioners were not able to allege the existence of a contract or the probability of a contract for employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.710" offset="3582746">That petition for rehearing was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.522" offset="3594031">Thereafter, we, petitioners, petitioned the -- the State Supreme Court for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.863" offset="3631438">And we again raise all of the previously discussed constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.330" offset="3653277">The Supreme Court denied this petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.835" offset="3663308">However, Mr. Justice Carter was of the opinion that the petition should have been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.803" offset="3691207">So I say the petitioners' case is grounded primarily on their contention that the conduct and agreement of the respondents wrongfully and unjustifiably impaired their reasonable expectation of employment in the industry and their federally protected right to pursue their professions and occupations.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.779" offset="3771037">The respondents' contention, with which the state court agreed, is that the petitioners had no standing to sue at all because they could not allege that they had an employment contract or a specific prospect of one.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.288" offset="3829133">We contend that it was the exclusion from all work opportunity by this monopolistic combination and not the deprivation of some specific contract that was the wrong committed here.</text>

            <text syncTime="991.261" offset="3964970">The opinion of the court below was based upon the assumption that the complaint in this case alleged interference with a specific contract or a specific business relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.018" offset="4032052">A reading of the complaint makes it readily apparent that the unambiguous allegations of the complaint charge not interference with a specific contract or a specific business relationship but rather alleged total exclusion from the opportunity to work from the right to pursue a calling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.019" offset="4132049">What they alleged in fact, we assert, is total exclusion from entry into the marketplace in which contracts of employment and business relationships are negotiated and consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.695" offset="4198713">It is this total exclusion from the marketplace which at one and the same time is the principle injury alleged and is the coercive power used by this monopolistic combination to deprive the petitioners of other constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.167" offset="4284604">Under our system, individuals are not guaranteed that they will ever have a specific contract or that they will ever enter into a specific business relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2319.199" offset="9276709">The Congress of the United States, under the Constitution that has been held by this Court, has the power to investigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.985" offset="9303876">Pursuant to that power, Congress has enacted a series of laws giving Congress the power to subpoena witnesses, requiring them to testify, establishing penalties for their refusal to testify and setting up a whole body of relationships between the witnesses and Congress, which body of relationship has been supplemented by the decisions of this Court, some of them last term, holding that the various federal guarantees of the First and the Fifth Amendment and other guarantees applicable to persons generally apply in -- to witnesses subpoenaed to appear before legislative hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2392.659" offset="9570534">The respondents take the position that the supreme law of the land does not apply here because the only interference, the only retaliation against these witnesses came from private sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.252" offset="9640960">In the first place, and this, I think, is perhaps the least important answer to this, in the first place, this is not the fact as alleged in the pleadings and as admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.888" offset="9687458">It is alleged in the pleadings that this was a conspiracy involving federal officials, that is officials of the Federal Government, acting jointly with a private monopoly combination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2693.404" offset="10773525">By the state sanctioning, a private monopoly, together with members of a federal committee engaging in a joint agreement and course of action designed to deny to individuals the right to pursue a calling because they had exercised their constitutional guarantees as witnesses before a federal committee and for the purpose of controlling their political ideas and association and for the further purpose of controlling the content of motion-picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.547" offset="10930155">It is our position that the state sanctioning of this kind of monopolistic control of the right to enter a calling based upon the surrender of constitutional rights constitutes a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.535" offset="11006119">And here once more, we are not concern with the question of whether or not the State could take away all tort remedies from everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.995" offset="11063902">The question here is whether this monopoly which control all employment opportunities in an entire industry may in effect set itself up as a licensing agency and determine who may and who may not enter into a particular calling and may, in the process of doing so, establish conditions calling for surrender of constitutional rights which must be met before access to that particular calling will be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.930" offset="11231713">Here, we have the sole point that has been raised that there is a no state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.899" offset="11271523">It is our assertion, our position that the State of California acted when it dismissed the complaint here and the State of California acted when the Court -- District Court of Appeal wrote an opinion establishing a policy of law, a policy of law that private monopolies have this power and that they may do these things and that the State will permit this to be done without affording its citizens any protection whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.680" offset="11402658">It is our position that this is very much like the case of Marsh versus Alabama, that where a private combination arrogates onto itself the kind of powers which belong to the Government, there was the running of a power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.792" offset="11479144">Here, it was the -- it is the determination of what the conditions are or what the prerequisites are for entering into a calling for having the right to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.773" offset="11531076">We say that there is no greater right in a private monopoly combination to run a town or to control who may enter a calling than there is in such a combination to operate a town and to utilize that town as a means of depriving people of their constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.162" offset="11620624">In effect, what they have done here is to set up this monopoly as a licensing agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.547" offset="11646119">And what they have said to this monopoly is you are free to bar from the profession anybody that you want to bar from entering into this industry for any purpose that you desire, for any reason at all as long as that person does not already have a contract or a reasonable prospect of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.102" offset="11732323">Now, if this is the law, then this monopoly can say, "We will not take any of the graduates of a particular university because the president of that university has criticized the motion-picture industry and has injured the motion-picture industry and we will not take any graduates from any university in the future where there is any criticism of the motion-picture industry," and there would be no wrong which the State was bound to protect under the Due Process Clause because the students graduating from that -- those colleges obviously did not yet have contracts or prospects of contracts of employment or this monopoly could exclude absolutely any political, any religious, any national, any social group which, at any particular time, was unpopular as long as the member of that group did not already have a contract or reasonable prospect of a contract and could exclude them on whatever ground the industry choose but the grounds here being that the employment of such people by one person in the industry would injure other members of the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.814" offset="12011207">As a matter of fact, this would give a private monopoly complete unequivocal control of all opportunity to determine who may or who may not work in an entire industry in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.234" offset="12080901">It is our position that to the extent that such powers may be exercise at all, they belong to the State and that even when the State lays down requirements for entry into a profession, witness the Konigsberg case, that State may not lay down unreasonable qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.769" offset="12175047">No more may a private industry -- industrial combination exercising monopoly powers in effect state powers lay down unreasonable and unconstitutional conditions for entry into a calling assuming arguendo that they have the right to lay down any conditions whatsoever.</text>
