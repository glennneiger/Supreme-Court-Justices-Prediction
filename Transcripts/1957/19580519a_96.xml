            <text syncTime="16.023" offset="64052">-- and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.292" offset="73143">The question presented to the Court on this review is, I think, simply stated, while this petitioner who was a pauper, an indigent person denied adequate and effective appellate review under the rule of this case in Griffin versus Illinois by the State of Washington because of his poverty in that first, he was denied a statement of facts whether that statement of facts be in the form of a stenographic transcript or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.473" offset="189858">And secondly, in that he was not afforded the assistance of counsel on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.317" offset="233221">In brief statement, the facts before this Court are as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.473" offset="253806">The action is here on certiorari to review the judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington denying the writ of habeas corpus sought by this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.018" offset="304065">Under the record, an information was filed back in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.629" offset="322456">The petitioner was charged with murder in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.726" offset="334890">He was represented by appointed counsel in the trial court, was appointed on October 17th.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.076" offset="356206">A trial of some nine days began on November 4th.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.182" offset="376686">The judgment and sentence following a verdict of conviction was entered on December 14th, and two days later on the 16th of December, he was incarcerated in the Washington State Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.423" offset="421616">There, while in the prison and without the benefit of counsel, he sought by correspondence and subsequent motion filed with the trial judge a “transcript of all the records” in his case and in other references that was designated as a transcript to the evidence -- a transcript to the trial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.319" offset="509179">The State represented by the prosecuting attorney and the trial judge treated the application or request as an application for a statement of facts, which is a term of art incorporated to the Washington procedural rule in statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.227" offset="576888">The petitioner sought the transcript of records or stenographic transcript or statement of facts, whatever you please to call it, under the provisions of a Washington State statute establishing our official court recorder of system under the terms of which to an indigent defendant, the transcript or stenographic transcript of the trial record which is made by the official court recorder, may be furnished at county expense to the indigent defendant if in the mind or in the opinion of the trial judge, the “ends of justice” will be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.994" offset="763925">The application was resisted by the county attorney who went to the point of securing an affidavit from the previously appointed trial counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.800" offset="815125">The application was denied by the trial judge who concluded that the ends of justice would not be served by the furnishing of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.520" offset="853995">And thereafter and within the time for appeal, the petitioner sought a writ of mandate in the Washington State Supreme Court requesting that the Supreme Court of Washington be directed to compel the trial judge to furnish the transcript as requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.501" offset="933930">Now, in his application, the petitioner's application for this writ of mandate, he asserted trial errors which are outlined in the brief of petitioner at pages 22 and 23 which on -- I shall not state, they were errors, suffice to say which could not be resolved, save and except by a review of the entire trial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.418" offset="1025672">They were not errors appearing on the so-called clerk's record which would consist simply of the docket entries for the papers of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.109" offset="1072379">The State made and does make no assertion that the appeal was prosecuted other than in complete good faith nor is there any contention that this is a frivolous appeal or that the petitioner sought a frivolous appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.549" offset="1146149">Furthermore, I think, they're appropriate to point out that before the trial court, the State did not contend that the complete transcript of the trial proceedings in stenographic form or otherwise was unnecessary to the review by the Washington State Supreme Court of the judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.702" offset="1230785">There was adequate showing made in the trial court and in the Supreme Court of the State of Washington as to the indigence of the defendant and he endeavored in both the application for writ of mandate and in his application for the free transcript to proceed without the benefit of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.134" offset="1340500">There is no waiver of the right of counsel on appeal in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.286" offset="1357113">He did advise the trial court that he would proceed pro se, as he indicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.685" offset="1466723">The short answer to that, sir, is that this petition or the writ of habeas corpus was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of Washington following the Griffin case, and those are the issues that we seek here to elaborate upon.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert W. Graham</label>
            <text syncTime="380.877" offset="1523461">That is correct, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.015" offset="1528059">It is a post-Griffin case, however, I think it appropriate to point out that it does not reach -- one of the questions that was raised in one of the four opinions in Griffin of the plaintiff so-called “sleeping” on his rights in that he did endeavor in the trial court to get free transcript and he endeavored to get the Supreme Court of the State of Washington to direct it to him.He sought, as I indicated, the writ of habeas corpus below and the Supreme Court of the State of Washington denied his application for writ without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.846" offset="1675285">Unfortunately, that perhaps is in violation of the Washington statutes but I think that's of no concern to us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.546" offset="1698168">I would point out that in his petition for the writ of habeas corpus, while he did not specifically request the trial court nor the Supreme Court of the State of Washington to furnish him counsel on appeal, he did assert in his application for writ that the defendants are entitled to right of counsel and he certainly did not waive any such known constitutional right if such be declared.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.096" offset="1800359">Now, presumably, certiorari was granted by this Court to in effect review and determine the scope of the Griffin case as applied to procedure in the State of Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="513.660" offset="2054583">I think there is no question as between the respondent here and ourselves as to the requirement that insofar as those assertions of error are concerned, they cannot be reviewed upon the so-called clerk's record.</text>

            <text syncTime="555.662" offset="2222602">Now, I don't mean to -- perhaps I should indicate to the Court that in terms of a statement of facts, which is somewhat of term of art, the statement of facts or formerly have to do with criminal law, the bill of exceptions must have been such as to encompass all of the matters intended to be raised on the appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="764.445" offset="3057685">Now, under our statutes, there is -- it is a jurisdictional prerequisite that the statement of facts be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.233" offset="3096869">Griffin rules, if I understand it correctly, that the statement of facts may be something less than the total transcript of the testimony of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.563" offset="3150158">The question is not before this Court as to how much less might have sufficed in terms of all of the errors asserted nor does it reach the question as to how anything less than the total stenographic transcript may be arrived at.</text>

            <text syncTime="823.813" offset="3295190">It also suggests procedures as to how that decision may be arrived at.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.125" offset="3316402">I submit that those questions are not here before the Court.The prosecuting attorney in the trial court and the judge in the court below assumed that the entire transcript of proceedings was necessary to the prosecution of this petitioner's appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.463" offset="3397799">There was no question in the trial court as to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.877" offset="3415458">It was assumed that without the so-called statement of facts or the so-called transcript of trial proceedings that he did not have a right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.870" offset="3455478">As a matter of fact, the trial judge and the prosecutor treated the appeal as a discretion or as a discretionary matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.921" offset="3491631">Now, I'd like to advert, if I might, to the question which is post by the last question and that is whether or not the stenographic transcript was so-called necessary within the rule of the Griffin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.545" offset="3562162">And I would point out that the state here for the first time, now contends that something less than the entire transcript of proceedings would suffice pointing out that under the procedure of Washington law in earlier statement, may be used in place of the entire transcript of proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.811" offset="3659233">As a matter of fact, the decisions of the Washington Supreme Court indicate that an appellant cannot be required to file an entire stenographic transcript of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.954" offset="3699775">There is no question as to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.460" offset="3721822">I would point out with respect to the same issue raised in the dissenting opinion in the Griffin case that neither in Washington nor in Illinois was the filing of a complete stenographic transcript a jurisdictional prerequisite to get in to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.508" offset="3810011">Both here and in Griffin the petitioner alleged that it was "necessary" or it was needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.182" offset="3840627">This Court assumed in view of the statement of the Attorney General of Illinois in argument, that while it was available in Illinois, nobody used it.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.136" offset="3884513">This Court assumed that it was needed or necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.033" offset="3916069">That issue has been controverted here in that the State has filed and it refers to the application for the writ of habeas corpus and in the petition on certiorari has -- has in effect denied that that was necessary or denied that the petitioner has been deprived a constitutional right by the failure of the State of Washington to furnish the so-called transcript of proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.776" offset="4011050">It seems to me that the rationale of the Griffin decision is simply stated that, those are procedure of the State of Washington as in Illinois placed the petitioner at a substantial disadvantage because of his poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.492" offset="4069878">In short, with respect to the evidence to an adequate and effective appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.313" offset="4089208">Now, I suggest that not only, was a statement of facts either in the narrative form in some fashion, not made available nor was the stenographic transcript to the proceedings made available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.939" offset="4151693">Certainly, the transcript of -- of the stenographic transcript of proceedings was in fact necessary to the effectuation of this plaintiff's appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.045" offset="4200176">And a reference to the court rules of the State of Washington in the elaborate procedures which were required of even the most confident counsel would certainly indicate that this petitioner, incarcerated in the Washington State Penitentiary, with the -- a theoretical right to furnish a narrative statement could not, certainly in fact, do such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.314" offset="4305189">I would point out that not only did he make however application for the stenographic transcript, but he made application for a statement of facts in whatever form might be appropriate or necessary to comply with the appeal procedure requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.216" offset="4376764">This record, I submit, raises an additional question as to the additional obligation on the part of the State of Washington to remove the substantial disadvantage under which this petitioner labored and that he did not have the benefit of counsel in the pursuit of his appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.735" offset="4442906">The record, I think, is clear that he certainly did not waive, he did not -- contrary to the State's brief and response - did not discharge his trial attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.112" offset="6012447">The facts as outlined by Mr. Graham are substantially correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.262" offset="6037002">I may add these additional facts following the charge of first degree murder being lodged against the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.902" offset="6067513">He contacted the firm of Donovan and Donovan Attorneys who for some period of time were cognizant of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.874" offset="6115474">These same attorneys at the request of the petitioner when the petitioner could not raise funds, were appointed by the trial judge in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.350" offset="6161345">I think a fair examination of the record would indicate that the petitioner in this case is not an illiterate or ignorant man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.609" offset="6206380">I think a fair analysis of the documents he has filed in our Appellate Court would indicate that he is a contentious, aggressive and literate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.113" offset="6264372">When the petitioner in this case requested the trial judge to grant him a transcript of the records in my case the trial judge treated this as a request for a full stenographic transcript under the statute enforced at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.085" offset="6336261">The trial judge decided that justice would not be promoted, which is the language of the statute, by granting this petitioner a stenographic transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.432" offset="6393626">From this decision of the trial court, the petitioner took a writ of mandate directly on this point.Our Supreme Court reviewed the precise action of the trial judge in this case and decided that the writ of mandate did not lie.</text>

            <text syncTime="2484.434" offset="9937711">Counsel inferred that the petitioner made an election to request a statement of fact or transcript of the entire proceedings and waived his right to request a clerk's record which might review certain errors of the -- I think the record does not support that, if the Court please that this man asked in his own language for the transcript of the entire proceedings including everything in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.432" offset="10053695">And under our statute, it was the clerk's obligation to furnish that to the Supreme Court of the State of Washington and that wasn't even done.</text>

            <text syncTime="2604.595" offset="10418364">There is correspondence that is not in the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.560" offset="10430171">The transcript was prepared by agreement between myself and the Attorney General's Office and I believe that it does include all of the documents of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.651" offset="10462563">There are certain matters of correspondence that, I think, just as -- as counsel the case would not be here material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.204" offset="10488790">There is some confusion, I think, in probably my own mind as well as in terms of this concept of bill of exceptions, statement of facts, and transcript and so forth, I think, it perhaps has been clarified that under the procedures of the State of Washington, to review the question as to whether or not the verdict is not supported by the evidence, the Supreme Court must have before it either in question and answer form, by transcript or the stenographer's notes or a full and complete narration helps and are not a -- not a part on that premise, that the -- that the statement of facts may be either narrative or question and answer form, but the fact is it must be of the entire proceedings, all the testimony of the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.494" offset="10685962">And as the Court will note in the court rules, to which I have referred and which I have incorporated in toto in the appendix to our brief, he not only must file that statement of facts and transcript but also must prepare an abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.085" offset="10744268">And the abstract in detail must show the witness, who he was, what he said in all of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.407" offset="10769554">My point is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.553" offset="10774152">This man is in prison in the State of Washington without access to counsel, certainly without access to the court reporter's notes of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.910" offset="10811559">It was -- it's a completely illusory position to suggest that he himself could prepare a statement of facts sufficient to constitute a narrative statement that would warrant the review of the entire evidence in the proceeding.</text>
