            <text syncTime="1617.396" offset="6469486">And remember always that this disclosure was made in the year 1948 when the Treasury maintain and said in so many words not by oral testimony alone but by the published regulations of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that we will allow no credit or your so-called over-ceiling payouts for raw material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.304" offset="6589127">And I don't care what the perjury lawyers now say about how agents had to investigate how this money was spent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.311" offset="6621205">The published regulations prohibited every agent of the Treasury from 1948 until after this indictment in 1942 from allowing a taxpayer one dime of credit for anything spent on the black-market no matter if he came in with gold engraved receipts to show who he paid it to and what he paid it for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.745" offset="6714932">And the Court of Appeals was imminently correct and it used the only term that could possibly use when it said that the Treasury disavowed this disclosure simply because it was trying to get these taxpayers to turn informer on the recipients of their payments who of course might have proved to be tax violators.</text>

            <text syncTime="3564.444" offset="14257737">But I don't doubt as there'd be much dispute that the Government -- of the Government's view is to put on all its evidence in a case of the defendant's right to have that evidence, that record to his conviction, adjudged by the evidence standing before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.935" offset="14327641">It seems to me that your dispute comes in connection with the motion by the Government here to remand in order to get everything in connection with the subsidiary motion made in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3598.654" offset="14394514">Our research may have been insufficient but we looked and searched and I am sure that the Mr. Solicitor General did and no one has come up with a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.813" offset="14451252">There's a point on these facts and I think -- I think it is solid grain in the whole system of criminal jurisprudence, precisely what you're talking about no one has ever carried this kind of a point into a court the last resort where it's been reported.</text>

            <text syncTime="3654.969" offset="14619794">Well, I would answer that the same way I did that the right of a court to protect itself from a verdict or a judgment obtained by fraud of course must be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.791" offset="14683115">But the right to criminal process in accordance with our established processes, as a due process of law and not in violation of the double jeopardy provision is equally sacred and where the two come in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.800" offset="14739122">If they do here, you still don't have much of a real problem in the administration of justice because the Court can be protected at any time and very adequately by an indictment for perjury and indictment for obstruction of justice in the precise question --</text>

            <text syncTime="3764.538" offset="15058129">The mandate of the Court of Appeals is, I will not quote it precisely, but in substance it says, “The case is remanded with directions to grant the motion to suppress and retry the case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3782.072" offset="15128242">Now, insofar as any of this new evidence goes to the question of suppression, I take it that that mandate would prevent use of that evidence for that purpose.</text>
