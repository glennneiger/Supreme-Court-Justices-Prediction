            <label>Mr. Harold Rosenwald</label>
            <text syncTime="11.802" offset="47125">Mr Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.463" offset="69799">In this case, there was an indictment in three counts under Section 254 of former Title 18 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.633" offset="118491">First count charged to the petitioner with conspiring with another person named Cameron to violate Section 254 by means -- by conspiring by means of deadly and dangerous weapons to assault two agents of the Alcohol Tax Unit of the Treasury Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.114" offset="232385">The second count alleged that at the same time and place, the petitioner and Cameron actually did assault one such agent named Reed and used -- assaulted him by the use of a deadly and dangerous weapon to wit, a -- a loaded shotgun.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.151" offset="328516">The third count charged a -- a similar assault with loaded shotgun against a second Alcohol Tax Unit agent named Frost.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.690" offset="414720">The second count stated that the federal agent who is the victim of the assault was seriously wounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.628" offset="466442">The third count simply alleged that the federal agent there involved was wounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.253" offset="504999">The defendant -- the petitioner rather, was arraigned, placed on trial in the District Court in Mississippi and pleaded not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.915" offset="567589">He was found guilty by the jury on all the three counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.304" offset="597159">And on the same day, he was sentenced to two years on the first count to be concurrent with the sentence on the second count for ten years on the second count and the ten years on the third count was sentences under the second and third count to be consecutive or a total of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.210" offset="700813">There was no transcript of the evidence at the trial, whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.359" offset="721398">There was no appeal taken from the conviction at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.685" offset="738638">There is nothing of evidence in this record before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.003" offset="763925">There is, that crept into the record someway, an affidavit taken before a credible investigative agents, which I don't know whether it was in evidence in the trial it shouldn't have been and it was rejected by the Court of Appeals as having any value bearing on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.704" offset="874789">In the -- after serving more than ten years, the petitioner filed a motion under Section 2255 of Title 28 to correct this sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.039" offset="936124">This motion was filed on January 22 of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.919" offset="963605">A -- a motion alleged that the sentences under the -- that the offenses charged in the second and third counts were only a single offense, and therefore the sentences under those two counts should not have been consecutive.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.929" offset="1059631">The motion doesn't clearly state but it surely implies, that at the time of the offense, the -- a gun was used but was only fired once.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.741" offset="1110936">And apparently it is claimed that the -- this was a shotgun with pellets scattered and the one shot struck the two federal agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.884" offset="1175510">The motion of the petitioner was denied by District Judge Mize on the grounds, stressed that he had a personal recollection of more than one shoppers-by although the crowd that it occurred more than ten years prior to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.456" offset="1249802">It made that there is no transcript taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.500" offset="1261923">And he said that in any event, each count of the indictment alleged the separate offense meaning the second and third count alleged separate offenses because separate victims of the shot were named.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.287" offset="1349068">He also made a statement that the motion had been denied on a prior occasion and cited as his authority to that statement, his own decision overruling such a motion filed by the petitioner's co-defendant and it's quite clear that the petitioner himself had never filed a motion to before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.374" offset="1445407">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard the appeal that was filed by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.795" offset="1487099">He proceeded in the form of progress in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.982" offset="1515833">And the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Judge, rejected the recollection of the District Judge as having any bearing on the question, found no evidence in the record worthy of consideration by the Court that there was more one shot fired and treated the case on the basis that the motion of the petitioner clearly stated that one shot and one shot alone was fired and that that one shot resulted in the wounding of these two federal agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.676" offset="1698691">And the Court of Appeals held that the one shot striking the two men constituted two offenses under Section 254.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.507" offset="1762011">And this Court granted certiorari, and the case is here as we submit on that narrow question whether a single shot of a shotgun which strikes two men can constitute more than one offense under Section 254.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.394" offset="1829512">The Government has stated the question quite differently and we are in complete disagreement with the statement of the question as it's presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.384" offset="1865456">Government statement should be a shot was fired on the same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.658" offset="1894609">There are two federal agents wounded on the same day or some safe language and to ignore the critical question in the case which is whether the single discharge of a shotgun can constitute more than one violation of the statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold Rosenwald</label>
            <text syncTime="539.908" offset="2159595">I stand corrected, Mr. Justice Whittaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.439" offset="2169731">One discharge of the shotgun and a number of bullets, pellets or whatever is in the -- attracted to it, using a shotgun scattered and struck two people.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.569" offset="2250188">Now, in this case, unlike the two preceding cases, we don't know delicate problems of state and federal relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.916" offset="2287595">Nor do we have is like to see the matter any constitutional questions where it come here with a simple matter construing a statute of United States Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.248" offset="2356976">The statute has two clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.165" offset="2384562">The first clause makes it an offense to forcibly resist, oppose, impede, intimidate, or interfere with certain designated federal officials referred in the prior section of the code or to assault any such official on account of his official duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.393" offset="2493544">There are six things that are forbidden.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.967" offset="2515801">The second clause of the statute proscribes the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon in the commission of any of the six forbidden acts mentioned in the first clause of the statute and prescribes a 10-year penalty for violation where the dangerous weapon is used and there are three years under the First Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.077" offset="2640248">Now, I think we can almost dispose of this case on the face of the statute itself without going beyond it or any extraneous resistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.016" offset="2716003">The Government argues and the two courts below seem to hold that this case -- that this statute condemned an assault with a dangerous weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.355" offset="2769398">They completely ignored the other things forbidden by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.908" offset="2787579">Now, we have to test that the decision of the court below against this statute as a whole, resistance opposing, impeding, suppose that the present forcefully holds the door against six federal agents who were attempting to enter a room in the performance of their duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.352" offset="2893322">That this Court say or where the court below had said under those circumstances, that there were six separate violations of the statue or I suppose that instead of using a simple force in case of arms, the petitioner here could wave the clock or the butt of a gun in other words deadly or dangerous weapon, of course, make it a knife as long as it's deadly and dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.879" offset="3023412">And he didn't point it at anybody, he didn't stab or strike anybody with this weapon, but he certainly resisted and opposed and perhaps added a few threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.373" offset="3093420">And in such a case if there were ten agents, would there be ten violations of the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="779.453" offset="3117767">Would the man be properly sentenced for ten years for each agent who was affected by his unlawful act, perfectly willing to agree with the -- would have violated the statute for how many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.220" offset="3168862">Once for each agent affected by what he did?</text>
            <text syncTime="796.471" offset="3185789">Now in this case on the face of the statute when the petitioner held his shotgun and before he fired, he's violated the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.466" offset="3233855">He committed an assault and pointed at them, I assume they knew what was happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.490" offset="3253917">But in any event, he pointed it at them, he made ready to fire, and his offenses should make this complete then and there.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.373" offset="3289443">He violated the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.803" offset="3295190">What happened to those bullets if they hit two federal agents with a stick, of if they hadn't hit any of them, he's violated the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.954" offset="3339807">But I don't think he violated at more than once because the statute says it should be upon the use of a dangerous or deadly weapon and he used it and that he might, it seems to me clear from the face which said to himself was the unit of prosecution in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.271" offset="3417025">The use of the gun in whatever way may have been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.679" offset="3442625">Consequently to, it's not material.</text>

            <text syncTime="1010.155" offset="4040620">What the -- there is such raised also in this case the question that's been before this Court several times in the last couples of years of the construction of a statute which is not clear and for this purpose I'm willing to assume for the sake of argument that the Government's position, the position of the courts below is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.890" offset="4207491">That this statute simply said whoever resorts to the dangerous weapon and we will assume that here you may take into account the consequences or at least notice it could be good (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.066" offset="4288261">In such cases, similar cases, this Court has stated several times that whether or not multiple punishments were intended to the -- to be imposed or may be imposed with the consequences of a single criminal act, depends upon the intention of the Congress in adopting the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.540" offset="4438100">And in determining there the intention we look at such, helplessly find or may find in the legislative history of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.611" offset="4502361">The logic -- logical problem is too difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.489" offset="4517930">It leads us to frequently, to an impasse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.828" offset="4531304">And whether one blow constitutes two more offenses under the common law, whether one shot that strikes two people is one murder or two murders is a matter that's been the subject of philosophical consideration where the courts (Inaudible) and it leads into a great quagmire of logical difficulties and fine distinctions that this Court has supported completely in such cases as Bell against United States and Prince against United States and the C.I.T. Credit Corporation case and has held that this is really a question of what Congress intended and the look -- the primary intention and if there is no clearly stated intention to impose multiple punishment for a single criminal act then we resolve the doubts in favor of the criminal defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.092" offset="4772362">Now, we have examined in our brief the legislative history of Section 254.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.925" offset="4811651">It's interesting but not very illuminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.964" offset="4827847">The statute was introduced at the request of the Department of Justice, and in 1934, there was a letter of the Attorney General to both Chairman of the House and Senate Committees and the judiciary respectively which is set forth -- and that is set forth in full in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.141" offset="4924500">And in that letter, the Attorney General requested that the Congress adopt general legislation to protect federal agents and he cited specific statutes already in existence, one of which made it an offense to wound the federal officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.189" offset="5012689">From this, we argue that the Congress said before it a suggestion at least or at least it was called to their attention that they might make an offense to wound the federal officer, and thereby, the consequences of the act condemned would be more significant than they are here but that, nevertheless, that course was empowered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.487" offset="5129927">There's nothing in the statute about wounding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.468" offset="5141838">The statute reads simply as it reads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.720" offset="5166811">Now, at -- there's very little more the debates in -- in the Congress are not very helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.551" offset="5198158">The -- there was a committee report referred to in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.704" offset="5210802">It does nothing more than paraphrase the statute as it was firmly written.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.058" offset="5228147">And I think the legislative history is -- is frankly helpful but I can't -- to say it's overwhelmingly imposed that Congress had any specific intention in the matter before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.339" offset="5285303">Now, of course, in these cases when statutes of this kind are under consideration by the Congress, nobody really says, “Well, now suppose if somebody shoots a shotgun and hits two people with the same shot, and this have no such specific help in this case and that the same suggestion that there was no intention, at least to deal with the consequences of the condemned act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.114" offset="5420408">Now -- but in the Prince case, it was probably more helpful legislative history but the rule stated in both Prince and Bell is that unless the legislative history, as I read those cases, unless the legislative history shows an intention to impose multiple punishments, the Court will not impute that intention to Congress because there would be penalties are too harsh and I cited a number of cases where multiple punishments were imposed in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.375" offset="5581427">It shows just how harsh they can, they can be terrific.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.761" offset="5610998">I did refer in the brief to the legislative history of Section 111 of -- under the 1948 revision of the criminal statutes, Title 18, Section 254 involved in this case and Section 118 of former Title 18 were combined to form this new Section 111 of Title 18 which covers the ground at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.989" offset="5795944">And that this Section 118 that was combined with 254 I trace back to the Criminal Code of 1909 and to the original connecting of that statute in 1905.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.365" offset="5857384">That statute for which and was specific statute to -- to 254 and covered only employees of the Bureau of Animal Industry of the Department of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.731" offset="5914854">And in its original version, that statute provided that it was an offense to discharge any deadly weapon at any officer or employee of the Bureau of Animal Industry or to use a deadly or dangerous weapon in resisting them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.130" offset="6000431">And the offense was clearly defined in that statute as discharging any weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.928" offset="6031673">In other words, the offense was done when the weapon was discharged, that was when the consequences were not material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.714" offset="6066782">I submit that that statute suddenly goes where it's about discharging a deadly weapon were dropped when the statute was included in the 1909 Criminal Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.464" offset="6145776">And I suggest in my brief that the reasons for the omission is that the words were considered redundant and really covered by the words “the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon” that the two statutes Section 250 -- no that we can and therefore infer that it was understood by Congress in adopting the Criminal Code of 1909, but the statute meant what it originally said that it's the use of the weapon or the discharge of the weapon that was condemned, that the consequences were not material and you didn't look to them and this statute being combined with 254, the two of them should be construed in the same way and therefore, 254 means just what 118 meant, and the offense is simply the use of the dangerous weapon without regard to the consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.740" offset="6442945">I've been discouraged by the statements of this Court in the Prince case and in the Bell case not to refer to cases decided under other statutes and yet it seems that this is always done so I could mention just a few of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.956" offset="6547749">The leading one, I think, is the Bell case in which this Court held that the transportation of two women at the same time in interstate commerce, in the same vehicle and on the same occasion for immoral purposes constituted only one violation of the Mann Act, that we don't count the number of victims of the unlawful conduct, that the deed is single and the offense is single.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.196" offset="6708767">The Government used that the words in this statute before the Court was singular whoever assaults any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.541" offset="6758087">They were just as singular in the Bell case, the words in the Mann Act, “whoever transports any woman -- any woman or girl”, it is customary in statutes to use single language of -- of -- in the singular, and that was not so controlling in the Bell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.140" offset="6864457">The bank robbery cases have some relevancy, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.004" offset="6896013">This Court held in the Prince case that Congress didn't intend to make it a separate offense to enter a bank and the felonious purposes and also separate offense to consummate the purpose by robbing the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.496" offset="6977933">That was all part of the same criminal transaction and only one offense or the statute was meant to cover alternatives and view the prosecutor in Court pick the alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.130" offset="7036447">We're not dealing, of course, in anyway with the validity of the indictment here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.824" offset="7063197">An indictment was all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.361" offset="7069362">The trial was all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.864" offset="7075422">The question comes up on a matter of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.005" offset="7091931">The prosecutor could frame his charge in a variety of ways, in the alternative in effect would provide for the exigencies of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.721" offset="7138847">But the question is how many offenses after all the evidence is in, how many offenses were committed?</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.110" offset="7176359">The bank robbery cases which have a real bearing on this case are two decisions, Lockhart against United States and Dimenza against Johnston decided by the Courts of Appeals, I think in the Sixth and Ninth Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.499" offset="7253995">And dealing with the clause of the bank robbery statute that makes it an offense in the process of robbering -- robbing a bank to put in jeopardy the life of any person and when the bank robber robs a bank with an armed -- with -- with a deadly weapon and puts in jeopardy the life of any person, that is a 25-year offense under the bank robbery statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.739" offset="7398922">But if he puts in jeopardy the life of several persons, it is not under these two cases more than one offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.527" offset="7446047">Now, I think that those cases have -- have a very important bearing on the case we have here because the way the statute is written, if petitioner had merely threatened with the use of a gun several federal agents, he would have been in almost exactly the position of the man in these two cases who walked into the bank that committed a robbery and put in jeopardy the life of more than one person and that in these two were recent cases is held to constitute only a single offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.298" offset="7741127">The mail bag cases start with the important decision of Ebeling against Morgan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.251" offset="7796924">Ebeling against Morgan held that it was a separate offense to cut each mail bag where they were all cut at the same time under a statute making it an offense to cut any mail bag with the intention of stealing the contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.806" offset="7871216">Ebeling against Morgan is a rather harsh case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.860" offset="7903399">There they were to be sure a successive act and the case that Mr. Justice Harlan put to me at the beginning of my argument is answered perhaps by Ebeling against Morgan answers of the day of their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.818" offset="7967242">There the man probably -- well, apparently went through the night and cut the bags immediately one after the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.445" offset="7993678">And one might think that that was one criminal transaction and only one violation of the statute and which went for the authority of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.022" offset="8035997">But it is a rather an old case, and I think it's somewhat inconsistent with some of the later cases if the Court which has decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.664" offset="8066612">And I would like to see it overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.979" offset="8087824">In effort to escape that case, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Kerr against Squier held on to another clause of the same statute and it was only one offense to steal three mail bags at the same time and made the very unconvincing distinction that you could steal three mail bags at the same time but you -- but to cut them you had to make separate motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.806" offset="8199210">Well, I had seen some of these mail bags and I don't think I could let three of them at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.188" offset="8220735">I think that would be even hard in cutting three of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.472" offset="8237871">It's certainly more of muscular effort, but the case is very easily explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.969" offset="8271830">Somehow, Ebeling against Morgan seems a little too tough to follow and so they made a distinction which is not very convincing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.735" offset="8326896">The common law doctrines are much less helpful than the cases under other federal statute because they don't help us in determining what the intention of Congress was in enacting this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.963" offset="8399830">And nevertheless, in addition to that, the common law cases were in great conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.994" offset="8435879">I do believe that the simple type of situation where a person fires a gun and strikes two persons with it, that the majority rule would hold that that is indeed two separate offenses, but there is authority tot the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.474" offset="8537861">On the other hand, where there is negligent homicide, the automobile cases the majority rule, quite inconsistently it seems to be that, there is only one offense if someone operates an automobile with -- in a criminal way and kills more than one people that is only one offense under the majority rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.535" offset="8638067">The Government has cited the minority decisions and doesn't mention the majority decisions in -- in the Government's brief.We wouldn't know if that is the minority rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2185.840" offset="8743288">Counsel for petitioner and the Government on agreement as to what constitutes the basic issue in this case and that is to discern the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.938" offset="8791667">What has Congress made the allowable unit of prosecution under this statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.530" offset="8818103">This case is therefore, free of any problems of -- of constitutional law, of double jeopardy, of consecutive trials such as represented in the two preceding cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.353" offset="8873378">Nor is there involved here as they were -- as there was in the Prince case decided last term whether Congress, whether earlier steps which later were consummated in a finally completed crime, are merged with that final crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.527" offset="8950073">This is a punishment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.610" offset="8958433">An issue now before this Court is whether Congress intended that a defendant, hereby, a single discharge of a shotgun releasing the many shotgun pellets who assaulted two federal officers and who intended two assault two federal officers on account of the performance of their official duties because the statute requires that there'd be that specific intent as to each of the federal officers assaulted whether such a defendant might be punished more severely than one who assaults only a single officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.806" offset="9131154">To discern congressional intent, we begin of course with -- with the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.734" offset="9154873">And the reading of the statute, the Government submits, discloses that the unit protected, the individual federal officer, the basis for federal jurisdiction, the performance by that officer of his official duties and the intent of the defendant required by the statute to be a specific intent to assault that individual federal officer for a reason specified in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.830" offset="9271275">These are all personal and individual as to each federal officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.486" offset="9297920">And, therefore, as a matter of statutory construction, the assault on each officer on account of the performance of his official duties is accepted offense and the number of shots fired is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.485" offset="9369913">This the Government submits, appears from the language of the statute itself but if the language is ambiguous, we look to the legislative history and the Government shall attempt to show that that legislative history also reveals that the intent of Congress was to protect each and every federal officer and that therefore that is the unit of crime.</text>
