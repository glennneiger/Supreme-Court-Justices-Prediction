            <text syncTime="16.732" offset="66873">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.644" offset="78576">I represent the petitioner who was the plaintiff below in a suit to recover treble damages caused by injuries by violations of Section 3 of the Robison-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.553" offset="162168">The question presented here today in this suit now is whether a party injured by a violation of Section 3 has the right to sue for damages and injunction under Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.156" offset="240536">Underlying that issue is whether Section 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act became a part of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.544" offset="274077">If it did, then it's one of the antitrust laws for which remedy is given by Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.780" offset="323082">Let me describe the Robinson-Patman Act in general now and I would be a little more particular of it later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.893" offset="359549">It consists of four Sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.378" offset="377417">Section 1 of the Act or Section 1 of the bill clearly amended Section 2 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.252" offset="420989">Section 2 of the bill and which is also in regard to Section 2 of the Act is a saving clause preserving rights of action under pending causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.233" offset="480862">Section 3 is the Section in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.967" offset="499775">Section 4 is an exemption of cooperative associations from the provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.528" offset="554109">Our position briefly stated this time is that the internal or what might be called an internal evidence consisting of the Robinson-Patman Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.348" offset="617326">And what I might call the external evidence consisting of the debates in the proceedings in Congress, all, I contend, clearly show that Congress intended that all Sections of the Robinson-Patman Act should amend and become a part of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.906" offset="703530">Now, let's get back to the Clayton Act for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.325" offset="733205">Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, respectively, give the rights of action for treble damages and for injunction for injuries and violation of “the antitrust laws.”</text>
            <text syncTime="200.794" offset="803109">Section 1 of the Clayton Act defines antitrust laws and it provides that the antitrust law shall include three named acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.465" offset="865802">These acts are named by their titles.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.401" offset="877505">One is the Sherman Act the title is given.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.958" offset="891820">One is the Wilson Tariff Act and the third is the Clayton Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.105" offset="924317">Therefore, whether a cause of action exist to the plaintiff here under Section 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act depends upon whether of not Section 3, became a part of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.194" offset="1004774">We contend it did by amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="290.667" offset="1162658">Now the title and the enacting clause, the Act itself is setup in the appendix 1 of our brief, starting at page 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.075" offset="1232248">The title and the enacting clause refer only to Section 2 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.656" offset="1282612">The enacting clause purports to amend only Section 2 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.959" offset="1311765">The Court of Appeals also I should say that quotation marks appear before and after the various paragraphs of Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.077" offset="1376235">But they do not appear before any of the subsequent Sections, Section 2, 3 and 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.699" offset="1410717">The Court of Appeals took the position that because the enacting clause only referred to Section 2 and because of the presence of those quotation marks only before and after the very paragraphs of Section 2 that that showed that Congress did not intend that Section 3 should become a part of the Clayton Act by amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.029" offset="1572049">It is our position that whether or not Section 3 amended and became a part of the Clayton Act, depends upon what Congress intended regardless of whether or not Section 3 was referred to in the enacting clause and regardless of whether or not there were quotation marks that it is a question of the intent of Congress and that the intention of Congress is not to be overwritten by the presence of the quotation marks only before and after Section 1 and because of the nature of this particular enacting clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.299" offset="1781133">It is our position that the entire Robinson-Patman Act was amendatory of the Clayton Act and that all four Sections of the Robinson-Patman Act are in an integrated part as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.250" offset="1860963">Now, I want to call your attention -- the attention of the Court first of all to the fact that quotation marks are absent from Sections 2 and 4 as well as absent in Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.710" offset="1930762">Now, Section 2 as I've stated before, is this Section that preserve pending causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.721" offset="1982798">Clearly, Section 2 was amendatory of the Clayton Act itself because it goes to the very heart or it doesn't go to the heart but it affects Section 1, equally absent with from quotation marks is Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.263" offset="2077048">Section 4 is the exemption of cooperatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.924" offset="2107664">Clearly, Section 4 amended the Clayton Act because the exemption affects Section 2 of the Clayton Act as amended by Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.916" offset="2163566">Now, if these two Sections clearly amended the Clayton Act in the absence of quotation marks, surely, the absence of quotation marks would not prevent Section 3 from amending the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.646" offset="2250501">There is another matter of conserve or importance in connection with Section 2.</text>

            <text syncTime="588.177" offset="2352692">Pending or orders the Federal Trade Commission issued on the effect or pending on review based on Section 2 of the said Act of October 15th, prior to the effective date of this amendatory act.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.554" offset="2414132">Now, the adjective “amendatory” with the noun “act” is not only used in an isolated instance there but it's again used in the next line, Your Honor, amendatory act and then about the six lines down amendatory act.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.649" offset="2490514">And then about five or six lines from the bottom, again, amendatory act so that Congress by its own words clearly characterized the entire act as being an amendatory act.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.622" offset="2586436">We -- It's a familiar principle of statutory construction that every word used in a statute is suppose to have been used deliberately and upon a purpose unless it can be said clearly to the contrary that it's a desperate unnecessary word.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.580" offset="2686224">And I say that when Congress in Section 2 used the word amendatory act four times, Congress clearly characterized the entire Act as being an amendatory act.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.231" offset="2760829">Then another element that indicates clearly that Congress intended the entire Act to be amendatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.495" offset="2821956">The cooperative exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.745" offset="2834913">The cooperative exemption in Section 4, nothing in this Act shall prevent a cooperative association and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.057" offset="2864170">Now, that applied -- that exemption applies indifferently not only to Section 3 but to Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.402" offset="2909518">So that Section 4 is, as I've stated before, clearly a part of the -- had become a part of the Clayton Act and if having referred indifferently to both Sections to -- for the exemption to having applied differently to both.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.143" offset="3008470">There is additional strong evidence that all four Sections were intended to become a part of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.813" offset="3075239">Now, it is our further position that the -- what the Act itself did, that is the Robinson-Patman Act, was to simply raise the horizon of old Section 2 of the Clayton Act and continue it in an extended matter beyond what Section 2 had originally applied but it's simply raised the horizon of that Act and that all Sections of the Robinson-Patman Act are integrated parts of the whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.601" offset="3282338">Let me call Your Honors' attention and it might take me the time here as to the nature in that respect of Section 3 and a comparison of Section 3 with Section 2 or Section 1 of the Act and Section 2 of the -- Section 1 of the bill but Section 2 of the Clayton Act as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.960" offset="3387768">Now Section 1 of the -- or Section 2 of the Clayton Act before its amendment had dealt primarily and above all with matter of price discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.025" offset="3488078">In the Morton Salt case, this Court commented that the original Section 2 had been construed to permit quantity discounts and the purpose of the Robinson-Patman Act was to limit this practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.174" offset="3552653">Now, Section 2 in its amendment, takes former Section 2 and makes some changes on it but retains the provision as to price discrimination which is at primary -- was its primary provision before and still remained it primary provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.482" offset="3677832">Then it divides the entire Section up into paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f).</text>
            <text syncTime="932.411" offset="3729554">At paragraph (b) places the burden of rebutting a prima facie case before the Federal Trade Commission about a person charged with this violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.145" offset="3788487">Now, (c), (d), (e) -- (c), (d) and (e) are parts -- the forbidding parts in addition to paragraph (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="960.951" offset="3843762">I'll come back to them in just a moment if you'll permit me.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.529" offset="3858077">Now, let me go to Section 3 before I make this comparison with the other Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.658" offset="3902589">It consists, why it was not paragraphed, it consists in essence of three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.217" offset="3940833">One part forbids discrimination by selling goods in any part of the United States that price is lower than those who have acted elsewhere for the purpose of destroying competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.027" offset="4000078">Another, to sell goods that are unreasonably low prices for the purpose of destroying competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.111" offset="4024424">Then the third, to discriminate against competitors of the purchaser in granting any discount, rebate, allowance or advertising service to a purchaser over and above a similar grants available competitors to respective goods of like grade, quality and quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.588" offset="4106344">Now Section 1 is similar in many respects or that the number one, the one I just put ahead, I marked here one, excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.516" offset="4185966">What I last read to discriminate against competitors of purchasers and grantingany discount is similar in many respects to paragraph (c) of Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.056" offset="4256183">It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce in the course to such commerce to pay or grant or to receive or accept adding of value as a commission, brokerage or other compensations or any allowance or discount in lieu thereof of getting back to the language or Section 3 to discriminate against competitors of the purchaser and granting any discount, rebate, allowance or advertising service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.579" offset="4386273">Now, paragraph (d) shows another similarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.045" offset="4408111">I'm trying to show that -- what I'm trying to show here is that Section 3 is in the same area, general area as these parts forbidden in Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.778" offset="4483030">I don't contend they're identical.</text>

            <text syncTime="1193.973" offset="4775811">Now compare that with Section 3 which forbids to discriminate against competitors for the purchase and granting any discount, rebate, allowance or advertising service.</text>

            <text syncTime="1540.074" offset="6160196">Now, he goes on, he discussed the features of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.929" offset="6179631">He then yielded if for questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.101" offset="6192379">The first question came from Representative (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.174" offset="6208679">I understand that Borah-Van Nuys is a separate and distinct Section from the whole provisions at some of the contraries on the part of the House state in me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.796" offset="6243161">There is no inconsistency and the House provisions for bail but that the Borah-Van Nuys amended was simply an additional remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.194" offset="6272731">Mr. Celler, I ask the this gentleman to read Section 3, the Borah-Van Nuys provision and then read Section 2 and Section 1 and see whether that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.416" offset="6313587">And let me point out that this bill is an amendment of the Clayton Act which provides that anyone agrees to find discrimination price or discount or allowance consumed or cover treble damages from the person guilty of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.712" offset="6382759">In addition to same act of discrimination as treble damages, the businessman can by Section 3 of the bill be held the Court and fine $5000 or imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.929" offset="6423615">Now skipping along, Mr. Celler, then he goes out, if a vendor is found guilty of discrimination as provided earlier (Inaudible) agree so far as treble damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.657" offset="6474606">Mr. Celler, if he violates provisions of Borah-Van Nuys provisions of the bill will be in subject to penalties or a criminal nature and you committed the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.964" offset="6515775">Mr. Hancock, would he also be liable for triple damages?</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.483" offset="6533851">Mr. Celler, “He would also have to respond in treble damages under the provisions of the Clayton Act anyone can agree and can sue”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.760" offset="6570945">Then Representative Miller took up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.474" offset="6581812">Representative Miller then began explaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.768" offset="6599053">Representative Miller also had been a member of the conference committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.324" offset="6613264">He then began explaining the various features of the bill then this colloquy we occurred on page 37.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.109" offset="6656418">Section 3 is the Borah-Van Nuys amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.322" offset="6669270">We accepted this amendment for the reason and this reason only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.915" offset="6683585">The first Section that bill is reported back here, amends Section 2 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.643" offset="6710544">I see my time is -- does the bill agreed to by the contraries carry the penalty of triple damages and also upon the earnings of criminal law.He said the penalty of treble damages is the old law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.493" offset="6757878">In other words, we made no change in that particular provision of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.852" offset="6775327">Section 3 which the gentleman from New York talks about is the Borah-Van Nuys amendment and is that is a criminal section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.666" offset="6802599">The first part of this bill has nothing to do with criminal offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.967" offset="6815765">It deals primarily in my opinion with the authority of the Federal Trade Commission to regulate and enforce provisions in Section 2 of the Clayton Act is amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.746" offset="6846903">Section 3 of the bill is placed in effort to make the criminal effects apply only to that particular Section and I believe it is a reasonable construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.964" offset="6879817">There is not criminal offense involved or anything outside or within that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.924" offset="6899670">In Section 3, Mr. Hancock of New York, it is not perfectly clear that any vendor who discriminates in price between purchasers is guilty of a crime and is also subject to triple damages to anyone who claims to be aggrieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.389" offset="6957453">Mr. Miller: “That is true but the criminal part is included in Section 3 and Section 3 only."</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.295" offset="6981172">Mr. Hancock of New York: “But it is part -- is part of the same act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.985" offset="6999876">Then here is the part that the court quoted, the Court of Appeals: “Of course it is but it is not -- the Clayton Act is amended by Section 4 of the Clayton Act is amended by Section 2.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.430" offset="7045642">All he was calling attention to was the fact that the other -- Section 3 did not amend Section 2 and that the criminal -- the criminal provision of the Act applied to Section 3 and Section 3 only.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.761" offset="7106978">Now, Mr. Celler “Is it possible for a man to violate Section 3,” may I finish this sentence?</text>

            <text syncTime="1835.737" offset="7342916">Nashville's entire case is based upon the contention to Section 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act as an implied amendment of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.144" offset="7380532">It does not claim that it was an express amendment that it became part of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.305" offset="7401117">It relies solely by implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.750" offset="7410939">Now, at the outset, Nashville is met with the burden of overcoming the rule of statutory construction of the presumption against implied amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.466" offset="7445838">Our first position is that it has not overcome this presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.013" offset="7460049">In order to do that, it must show more than there is a mere possibility that Congress might have thought or indented that Section 3 will become part of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.704" offset="7494740">It must show that was a necessary intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.037" offset="7512085">Now, let's examine three aspects of Nashville's contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.778" offset="7539043">First is Section 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act and amendment of the Clayton Act at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.556" offset="7570181">Secondly, assuming arguendo there is an implied amendment of the Clayton Act is that the kind of amendment that becomes a part of the Clayton Act and does one of the antitrust laws as defined in Section 1 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.746" offset="7642906">And then thirdly, what do we find in the legislative history with respect to the intent of Congress as to whether Section 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act was or was not to become part of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.607" offset="7706331">Now, as to the first point, a definition of an amendment of an act is set forth in Nashville's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.147" offset="7748545">It's one sentence that appears on pages 17 and 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.920" offset="7763592">It states that a law is amended when it is permitted to remain and something is added or taken from it or it is in some way altered to better accomplish its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.651" offset="7802567">In this case, the Clayton Act was allowed to remain insofar as Section 3 is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.023" offset="7828062">Section 3 certainly takes nothing from the Clayton Act and it does not alter the Clayton Act in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.551" offset="7862126">The question then is whether it adds something to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.641" offset="7874560">We submit that Nashville has confused the addition of something to the antitrust laws with the addition of something to the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.855" offset="7911340">Section 3 adds something to the antitrust laws but adds nothing to the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.189" offset="7932656">If Section 3 has been written to say, an act in violation of Section 2 of the Clayton Act as amended by Section 1 of the Robinson-Patman Act shall be subject to criminal penalties then in that case the Section would have added something to the Clayton Act but it did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.644" offset="8006531">It set up its own separate standards of what constitutes prohibited acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.986" offset="8031922">So our position is that this Section 3 stands as a separate piece of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.765" offset="8067030">This is illustrated by a consideration of what would -- what effect a repeal of Section 3 would have on the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.349" offset="8097332">If were repealed as the Clayton Act would be completely ineffective, it would stand just as it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.131" offset="8120424">Similarly, you could repeal the Clayton Act in Section 3 which stands completely in its own feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.175" offset="8144666">It sets forth its own standards of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.317" offset="8157205">It sets forth its own penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.145" offset="8168490">So we submit that Section 3 is not an amendment of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.954" offset="8207778">Next quest -- and it's no more in amendment for example than other laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.766" offset="8230975">The antidumping provisions of the Revenue Act of 1916 prohibited persons from bringing -- importing articles into the United States and selling them at substantially less than or actual value with the intent to injure industry and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.121" offset="8300460">Under the theory advanced here if Section 3 is an amendment of the Clayton Act, similarly this antidumping provision of the Act of 19 -- Revenue Act of 1916 is an amendment of the Sherman Act and one of the antitrust laws referred to in Section 1 of the Clayton Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2112.431" offset="8449672">Now, the next -- that's the next point I'm coming to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.391" offset="8465554">We draw distinction between the use of the word amendatory and part of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.879" offset="8487497">Now, counsel for Nashville in his argument stated correctly we think at the beginning that the question was whether or not Section 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act became part of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.765" offset="8530965">And then he used the word it's amendatory to Clayton Act with the assumption that any act that was amendatory became part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.662" offset="8566596">Now, to us the word amendment could have many meanings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.378" offset="8585509">It could mean something becomes part of.</text>

            <text syncTime="2203.879" offset="8815491">That Section provides antitrust laws as used herein includes then at least by title, the Sherman Act, the Wilson Tariff Act as amended and this Act, meaning the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.621" offset="8874423">Now, it's shown in our brief Section 1 of the Clayton Act was intended to be exclusionary, and to answer the first question asked by Mr. Harlan, at the time the Clayton Act was passed by Congress, it had only a few weeks before passed the Federal Trade Commission Act which was also an antitrust act in the broad sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.692" offset="8974733">And we think the -- one of the -- that was one of the reasons why that definition of antitrust laws was put in the Clayton Act was to exclude the Federal Trade Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.065" offset="9016216">Furthermore, if Congress had not intended Section 1 to be exclusionary in character, it did not have to define antitrust laws at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.748" offset="9046936">All it had to do is use the word antitrust laws in the body of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.139" offset="9064490">And any subsequently enacted antitrust law would automatically be subject to treble damages than the injunctive rights in private parties provided by Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.404" offset="9117571">So we say that the test is whether or not Congress clearly intended that the statute become part of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.253" offset="9165009">Now another I mentioned the expressed amendment by revising the text.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.660" offset="9182563">Another means Congress has used to indicate it wanted a section to become part of the Clayton Act is found in the 1955 statute by which Congress gave the government a private right to sue or right to sue for single damages when it was injured by reasonable violation and the Section 5 which they provided for uniform statute of limitation in private treble damage suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.389" offset="9273469">In that bill, Congress said, the following Sections, number 4 (a) and 4 (b) shall be added to the Clayton Act immediately following Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.922" offset="9319654">In those two instances, you had a clear intention of Congress that the two instance the Robinson -- Section 1 of the Robinson-Patman Act, the revision of this text and this 1955 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3198.235" offset="12792895">Well, the next point is legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.847" offset="12807314">Section 3 originated as a language of Section 3 originated in the Senate the language of the Borah-Van Nuys bill which died in the Senate, now referred to as the Borah-Van Nuys language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.690" offset="12858723">Now when the bill became the Robinson-Patman Act was under consideration in the House, a motion was made to substitute the Borah-Van Nuys language for the language of the House bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.092" offset="12908356">The language of the House bill at that time was substantially the same as it's now found in Section 1 of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.025" offset="12936046">That motion was defeated so that when our present -- the bill that became the Robinson-Patman Act left the House, it has the history of the House rejection of what is we now find in Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.542" offset="12990067">When the bill after enacted by the House, went to the Senate, the Senate rewrote its text and it added what is now -- the language now found in Section 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.455" offset="13045760">And it did not add it as a separate Section outside of quotation marks so we find it today, it added it as a part of the amendment of Section 2 of the Clayton Act and made it subsection (h) within quotation marks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.578" offset="13098214">If that Senate bill had become the final form of the statute, we wouldn't be here today because Section 3 would purely be a part of the Clayton Act and one upon which treble damage actions could be founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.088" offset="13152340">So in this posture, the two forms of the bill went to the conference committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.527" offset="13174073">The conference committee compromised differences between the House and the Senate by accepting substantially the House version of the amendment of Section 2 of the Clayton Act which did not contain the Section 3 language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.899" offset="13227572">And took the Borah-Van Nuys language out of where the Senate had placed it as an amendment of the Clayton Act and made it a separate statute with a separate number were it is not a part of the amendment of the of Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.816" offset="13291207">Our position is that that was the liberate action by Congress and shows that it intended that Section 3 was not to become a part of the Clayton Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3361.353" offset="13445329">But when it is remembered that many of the acts that violate Section 1 of the Robinson-Patman Act or Section 2 of the Clayton Act as amended, also violates Section 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act then we think that the meaning of the debates becomes clear.</text>

            <text syncTime="3392.741" offset="13570926">It's possible of course for a man to violate Section 3 and by the same act be guilty of violation of the other sections of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.058" offset="13600183">That would be entirely possible.</text>

            <text syncTime="3422.225" offset="13688895">And where that very same act also violated the different criteria set forth in Section 3 of the Robinson-Patman Act then the man would be subject to the criminal penalties, and that we think is what they were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.984" offset="13747931">There are many such instances because of the Section -- the first part of amended Section 2 of the Clayton Act relates to price discrimination.</text>
