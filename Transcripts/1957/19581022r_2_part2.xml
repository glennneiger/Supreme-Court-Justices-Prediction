            <text syncTime="61.028" offset="347512">There's a concept that there must be some finality to direct review of -- of criminal judgments and that's a policy which should be respected.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.158" offset="388054">And then the district judge should not be asked now to hold a hearing to determine what was the evidence that was introduced at a trial some 13 years ago and to resolve disputes as to what that evidence was.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.558" offset="453569">That's not a collateral attack.</text>

            <text syncTime="584.903" offset="2442951">That's the whole point for suspending a 2255 case back to the trial judge because it's remanded is the most familiar with the dispute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold Rosenwald</label>
            <text syncTime="602.834" offset="2514735">May it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="607.450" offset="2533125">The Government has introduced various matters that -- what the evidence was in this case, there is no record.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.927" offset="2579101">Unless we keep, there is no record here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.790" offset="2590490">We don't know what the evidence was.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.496" offset="2597386">Mr. Sand has stated that the co-defendant, Mr. Cameron, had a shotgun though it is -- there was no evidence to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.717" offset="2630196">As a matter of fact, in the overt action of the indictment, it is stated that the defendant, Lovander Ladner was carrying a shotgun in his hand and nothing whatever is said about a hammer.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.642" offset="2669902">And in this affidavit which the Government has claimed, which appears, too in this brief, it is also said that, “Well Mr. Carter.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.094" offset="2703757">I noticed that Lovander Ladner was carrying a shotgun in his hand,” nothing whatever was said about the co-defendant, Mr. Cameron.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.130" offset="2735940">We don't know what the (Inaudible) had before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.087" offset="2747747">We don't know what the evidence was that was presented and whether it was contragrated or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.566" offset="2781602">We simply don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.106" offset="2795813">Here are just a few matters I want to mention briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.750" offset="2822353">Government predicates most of its argument and claimed that the words in the statute on account of the performance of his duty, it appears in Section 254, mean that there was some kind of a specific intent on the part of petitioner or anyone who brought a statute to commit the offense against the injured party.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.439" offset="2973132">I don't read those words as showing any specific intention whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.810" offset="2998627">It merely -- those words merely describe the circumstances under which the assault or the resistance or the opposition occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.778" offset="3042513">The words are no different from the other words in the -- or just above them while engaged in the performance of his official duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.858" offset="3086817">And as the Court will notice in the present brief of the statute, Section 111, of Title 18, those words are pronged together.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.088" offset="3155675">They're no longer separated.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.959" offset="3163199">There's one compendious phrase, “While engaged in or on account of the performance of his official duties.”</text>
            <text syncTime="774.526" offset="3201442">The Government is using those words to support an argument and then goes on and says, “That the intention must be personal with each defendant, therefore, there's a separate offense of each defendant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="788.775" offset="3258493">That the -- the conclusion is the premise's end justified, the conclusion of course with regard with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.874" offset="3302902">Now, I want to -- I made no contention whatever that if the statute said, “Whoever wounds an officer -- a federal officer, let the wound in the two officers (Inaudible) under the circumstances in this case would constitute two offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.704" offset="3378239">What I said was if the statute so read, and we would -- we would have to and go to the problem of the Bell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.877" offset="3422856">And I argued the Bell case on that assumption but it did say.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.139" offset="3447933">But, I certainly didn't concede that there would then be two offenses if the statute so read and I am clear that there wouldn't be.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.048" offset="3507597">Now, with respect to Section 2255, I would suppose that the words of the statute itself were clearly broad enough to cover this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.858" offset="3566843">They are quoted on page 3 of my brief and they allow a prisoner in custody under sentence of a Court to be released if he shows that the Court was without jurisdiction to impose a sentence or if the sentence was in violation of the constitutional laws of the United States or is in excess of the maximum authorized by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.268" offset="3684394">I can't imagine how we could come more clearly within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.303" offset="3704560">There's nothing in the -- in the statute about what facts can be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.715" offset="3726190">If the records of the Court don't show conclusively that he's not entitled for relief, under the statue, he is entitled to a hearing and what facts are necessary to show whether they were brought before the jury or not, the statute decided on all of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.036" offset="3787525">The remedy has been used repeatedly in cases of excessive sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.039" offset="3803512">It was used in the Gore case.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.308" offset="3808632">It was used in the Bell case.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.694" offset="3822111">In most of the cases cited in my brief, either habeas corpus or Section 2255 were used to attack an excessive sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="973.339" offset="3996714">We can always -- we can do it both ways, do it any time as long as the matter is still moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.816" offset="4018657">As a matter of fact, the early occasion seemed to hold this will tell you, certainly, the legal party is sentenced, you may not invoke habeas corpus or 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.863" offset="4054810">Those two half the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.999" offset="4059408">It's too bad we have to go back there in 13 years and I suppose the petitioners thought that until he served the 10-year legal sentence, he has no right to bring this motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.298" offset="4096606">He did not have to raise it on appeal and the question remains open to that.</text>
