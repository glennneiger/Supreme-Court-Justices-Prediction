            <label>Mr. William H. Foulk</label>
            <text syncTime="18.206" offset="72725">If Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.464" offset="77845">At adjournment yesterday, I had said that the appellant's first pleading in the trial court in Florida was a motion to dismiss on the ground of the Florida court like jurisdiction of the subject matter of the suit which was the 1935 trust, and of the trustee and the appointees of the property of that trust who were nonresident parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.412" offset="209607">The trial court heard that motion and properly found as we thought, though this case is primarily concerned with the valid -- validity and effect of certain powers of appointment rather than a will, recognizing our position right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.939" offset="307722">He went on to hold that he was inclined to think that the matter sought to be presented by this motion can best be determined at the final hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.181" offset="352653">We weren't satisfied with that and we petitioned the Supreme Court of Florida for certiorari on the ground that the trial court had no jurisdiction and that the parties should not be put to the expense of a final hearing if the Court had no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.092" offset="436349">The Supreme Court of Florida heard us but deny our petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.543" offset="462158">The executrix send and pleaded all of the parties in -- an action in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware, which, as Your Honors will recall, had the raise in its State and had control over the Wilmington Trust Company as trustee of the 1935 trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.927" offset="555677">Having -- she brought that suit for two valid reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.642" offset="574485">One, because she wanted to expedite the settlement of the State and two, she had been charged in the Florida proceedings with a failure to capture assets and therefore a dereliction in her duty as executrix.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.289" offset="653061">Having brought that suit in Delaware, she came back and filed her answer or the appellants joined with her in filing an answer in which she said to the Court, “Now, the Delaware law applies to this trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.528" offset="730070">It's a trust that has its home in Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.877" offset="743445">And we are filing with this complaint a copy of our complaint or with this answer, a copy our complaint in Delaware and we're again raising in this answer the question of the jurisdiction of your Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="203.475" offset="813871">At the same time, the appellants filed a motion to stay the Florida action pending the determination of the validity of the trust in Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.444" offset="865698">The respondents or the plaintiffs in the lower court, the appellees here immediately filed a -- an application for an injunction against the executrix pursuing the suit in Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.106" offset="940408">It was a rather meaningless gesture because she had merely acted as an inner pleader in the Delaware proceeding and asked the Court to decide who was entitled to her mother's property in this trust, whether or not her stepsisters or half sisters got property under the will or her children got $470 -- $400,000 and the other appointees, $17,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.996" offset="1063915">Surprising it may seem in that application for an injunction, the plaintiff said that the Circuit Court had already decided the question of jurisdiction and that the executrix was guilty of bad faith in going to Delaware and filing this action to do just what they charged then with not doing, and they went on to charge that she was trying to lose the case in Delaware to benefit her children.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.321" offset="1197244">The Court -- another judge then the trial judge who had heard the motion to dismiss, granted the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.233" offset="1236846">Thereafter, both of the parties filed motions for summary decree or summary judgement in the trial court in Palm Beach, and that hope, I neglected to say, we again appeal or petition the, so far as the Supreme Court from certiorari from the denial of the trial court to grant our petition to stay and from its grant of the injunction against the executrix going forward in Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.205" offset="1392744">That was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.476" offset="1397864">Then we -- both parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.004" offset="1420016">And the case was argued before the trial court, and the trial court found that as to jurisdiction, the trust assets and the trustee in Delaware, no personal service has been handed upon the defendants who have failed to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.158" offset="1500578">Therefore, the trial court dismissed the case as to the Wilmington Trust Company trustee and as to the persons who were appointed to the $417,000 under the power -- powers of appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.247" offset="1568914">But it went on to say that as to the answering defendants, the executrix and her three children that the Court was going to decide, determined that this trust agreement of 1935 was testamentary in character and not having met the requirements of the statute of wills, it was valid, and therefore all of the property, the $417,000 plus the remaining million dollars that went to the executrix under the power, anyway, passed under the will to the -- the beneficiaries of the will rather than the trust.</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Foulk</label>
            <text syncTime="469.247" offset="1876950">This was simply a suit with the avowed purpose of determining what passed under the will of a Florida domiciliary.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.087" offset="1916343">We claim that the will was crystal clear and needed no determination that the whole crux and the only question in this case is the validity of a Delaware trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.984" offset="1975902">We asked for a rehearing from the trial court on the basis that the trial court had held that it had no jurisdiction over indispensable parties and it could enter a final force -- enforceable decree because the indispensable parties were not there, that motion was denied without argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.034" offset="2072033">We then appealed to the Supreme Court of Florida on two bases.One, that the Court had no jurisdiction because of the absence of the trust res and indispensable parties including the trustees and the appointees, and two, that they were wrong in -- that they had not applied Delaware law and that they were wrong in the law that they did apply which presumably was -- was Florida law.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.202" offset="2216751">In the meantime, the Delaware case had proceeded and before we got to the argument in the Florida Supreme Court, the Delaware Chancery -- chancellor, ruled that he was not bind down by the decision of the Florida trial court and that the trust was a Delaware trust and under Delaware law it was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.463" offset="2321763">We filed a petition in the Supreme Court of Florida to remand and dismiss on the basis of the Florida or the Delaware Chancellor's decision and again brought to the Court's attention that Delaware was the only jurisdiction which had the right to declare the validity of this trust and it is spoken in -- it was entitled to full faith and credit and res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.759" offset="2442971">That motion was heard at the same time appearing on the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.667" offset="2466586">And in its judgment, the Supreme Court of Florida found -- dismissed that petition to remand and determine that it had jurisdiction over all parties because this was in reality the construction or the determination of what passed under a will.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.038" offset="2560104">And it went on to -- to find that the lower court is right in finding that this was a testamentary disposition and it added to that that it was a mere -- that the trust was a mere agency agreement and therefore, no rights passed under the power of appointment, and that was true under Delaware law.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.199" offset="2680790">It specifically rejected the application of Delaware law.</text>

            <text syncTime="736.837" offset="2947344">Now, we filed a petition for rehearing in the Florida court and we raised every question we could think of that we raised up until then lack of jurisdiction full faith and credit failure to grant due process in applying the applicable or the proper choice of law and that was denied without argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.649" offset="3078583">Then before the time run out for the appeal to this Court, the Supreme Court of Delaware sustained the chancellor in Delaware and found that -- that was not stopped by reason of the Florida court's decision and that the trust was a valid Delaware trust and it had the right to determine the policy of the State of Delaware on the press that existed in its State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1438.379" offset="5753417">Section 8702 of the Florida statute annotated, deals with declaratory decrease, provide that any person claiming to be interested or who may be in doubt as to his rights under will, may have any question of construction or validity arising under such will determine and obtain a declaration of his rights thereunder.</text>

            <text syncTime="1522.890" offset="6091546">Under that power of appointment, that $400,000 will be taken out of these trust assets and placed in two existing trust for two of her grandchildren who were children of her daughter, Mrs. Hanson, who was named the executrix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.220" offset="6148807">So over here, we have -- if the trust of the State is good and if the power is good, the $400,000 go into two trusts, existing trust for two grandchildren.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.491" offset="6189871">However, if either their trust agreement was invalid or if the power of appointment was not properly exercised, then under the terms of the will, that same $400,000 would go into two different trusts for two other daughters of hers other than Mrs. Hanson, the executrix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.191" offset="6256744">Now these two daughters started this action to challenge the validity of the trust and the exercise of the power under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.353" offset="6301362">They named as defendants, these two grandchildren, their mother, and many other people who are really unnecessary to this question because there were other earlier powers and everybody practically whoever been named was put in as defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.379" offset="6369489">The two children preserved and then their mother came in and had herself appointed as a guardian ad litem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.396" offset="6397492">So the executrix within the Florida court, she was guardian ad litem for her children in a family squabble over $400,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="3218.902" offset="12875546">Because when she died on November the 20th, 1952 as a domiciliary of Florida, she left a will which had been made on December 3rd, 1949 and she left executed on that same day, December 3rd, 1949 a so-called power of appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.650" offset="12974498">And thereafter, another paper of July, 1950, and she says in the original trust that the disposition of that trust shall be upon her death in accordance with her last writing accepted by the trust company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.165" offset="13052656">And her last writing doesn't even exercise the power of appointment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.320" offset="13073241">So after she died, eight days letter -- later, Mr. Foulk, who is in these affidavits, submitted to the Court, describes a general counsel for the Donner estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.553" offset="13138129">Mr. Foulk wrote a letter and he's telling some beneficiaries on November 28 at page 79 of the Florida record, about this trust with the Wilmington Trust and he says that certain monies are to be paid to this executrix after the payment of the following specific legacies and he's talking about legacies in describing the so-called remainders in the trust.</text>

            <text syncTime="3315.185" offset="13260696">And thereafter sir, this executrix and her counsel Mr. Foulk filed an inventory as required by the Florida law and listed these assets of the Wilmington Trust Company trust as part and parcel of this Florida State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.465" offset="13349825">More, she, the executrix of Florida domiciliary, Mr. Foulk her lawyer permitted in Florida to represent her, both took fees and commissions on that inventory which included these assets even though they were located in the State of Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.231" offset="13444911">These were the facts that came before the Court.Our people who are the appellees here had a right to rely upon that inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.951" offset="13487752">And when the time was passing, and nothing was happening about disposing of the estate, the appellees brought this suit in the State of Florida and please let's not be confused further, page 12 of the record in Florida shows that the plaintiffs pray one, that the Court construe and determine the question of what portion of the trust property involved herein passes under the residuary clause of the will of the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.831" offset="13615229">Why is that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.787" offset="13623066">Because in her will, she said that her Florida State should pay all the taxes even on this trust, which he described in Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.189" offset="13668728">So when this action was commenced, what happened first?</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.980" offset="13695896">Well, low and behold, Mr. Foulk and the executrix rushed into the court in Florida, went to pay back the money and correct the inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.099" offset="13732362">Up to that time, they'd never done anything of a kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.706" offset="13746782">The Florida court refused to take back the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.938" offset="13759739">That procedure is stayed to this very moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.354" offset="13773322">Now what did they do next?</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.591" offset="13782309">Everybody including these trust companies had been cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.568" offset="13798191">I said that in her will she gave directions to the Wilmington Trust Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.385" offset="13817522">It's mentioned in the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.397" offset="13825567">I said that under her will, the Delaware trust company which Mr. Foulk is the Director and Head of the Trust Committee by the way, that Delaware trust company is a legatee under this will, and both of those trust companies were notified like all the other parties by constructive service, mailing by the clerk to their last known address under the records of Florida statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="4908.182" offset="19632692">The -- because of the time limitations or rather I should say the number of counsel limitations which were imposed, the Wilmington Trust Company and Delaware trust company has also consented that I say what need to be said on their behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.403" offset="19693610">I have represented neither of those institutions in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.262" offset="19724957">The interest of my clients, of course, is sustaining the Delaware judgment and the validity of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.971" offset="19759856">Let me cite preliminarily what I think is not an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.553" offset="19786188">This Court is not concerned with the merits of the question of whether the 1935 Trust was an agency agreement or an inter vivos trust that presents no federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4962.262" offset="19848986">There is substantial authority which would support the Delaware view on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.430" offset="19869675">Recent action taken by the restatement in May of this year, cited on page 5 of the brief of the Wilmington Trust Company is authority for the validity as a trust of such an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.789" offset="19939056">What this Court is concerned with is or are two constitutional questions which were separate in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4995.622" offset="19982420">And as it seems to me clearcut analysis the problem requires at all times that a distinction be kept in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.546" offset="20030171">The first is the full faith and credit question as to whether Delaware should be bound by the Florida judgment because as we contend, Florida was lacking in jurisdiction over indispensable parties and hence the judgment is binding on no one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5026.467" offset="20105822">The second constitutional question is one which would arise if the Court should resolve that first question adversely to my clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="5036.630" offset="20146469">On the hypothesis, as to Mr. Justice Black, put it that everybody was, in fact, before the Florida court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.971" offset="20175830">Did Florida choose the right law when it shows Florida law and not Delaware law?</text>
            <text syncTime="5051.191" offset="20204669">And under teachings of this Court, the erroneous choice of law can interrupt -- can deprive a judgment based on the erroneous choice of law of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.406" offset="20253571">Now there are two separate questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5066.000" offset="20263915">Let me address myself first if I may to the question of the jurisdiction of the Florida court over the Delaware trust company and the Wilmington Trust Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5079.513" offset="20318041">That jurisdiction purportedly came about by virtue of a Florida statute which contained 10 subdivisions, 9 of which dealt with in rem actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5092.944" offset="20371749">The one, under which the Court purported to act presumably and the decision of Florida says nothing about it, is one which authorized the service by publication for the construction of a will, deed, contract or other written instrument and for the judicial declaration or enforcement of legal or equitable rights thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.902" offset="20471536">And let me start and approach the problem with what I'm going to call pre-McGee law and then speak of McGee against Insurance Company and what if any impact it may have on the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5129.858" offset="20519393">Certainly -- certainly, absent the minimum contact theory, the Court where a will has been probated has no jurisdiction in a plenary action to determine whether out-of-state property, owned by out-of-state people or let me put it this way, whether out-of-state property claimed by out-of-state people, ownership of which is claimed by out-of-state people can be rested and determine -- taken from and repost in the hands of the administrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="5169.928" offset="20679680">This isn't a question and I think the distinction is important as to whether or not out-of-state properties owned by the decedent passes in one way or another under the Florida will.</text>
            <text syncTime="5182.354" offset="20729313">This is a much more basic question than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5184.979" offset="20739866">This is a question of whether out-of-state property is, in fact, owned by the Florida decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5190.826" offset="20763272">And I suggest to Your Honors that this case is no different leaving aside minimum contacts for the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.330" offset="20793260">This case is no different that it would have been if the administrator had filed a suit against the Delaware resident who held shares of stock owned by the decedent and claim that those shares of stock had been transferred by the decedent during her lifetime, as a result of fraud and deception practiced upon her and had asked that that ownership or rather claim of ownership out-of-state could be adjudicated in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.953" offset="20919798">I see that there's no difference this Court in the Bakers, the Eccles case has held that the Court of domicile of a decedent could not determine in a plenary action against the nonresident where intangibles were held that the interest of that nonresident in those intangibles was cut off.</text>
            <text syncTime="5258.557" offset="21034214">Now that has been -- was based on Pennoyer v. Neff and I think Pennoyer v. Neff has never been willed away in those circumstances unless, and I'm going to come to the minimum contact, it was on some minimum contact theory.Let me say preliminary about minimum contact.</text>

            <text syncTime="5390.652" offset="21562514">Florida doesn't have a minimum contact statute such as California had which provided that if an insurance policy was delivered to a beneficiary in California and premiums were paid from California that that insurance company was amenable to in personam jurisdiction in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="5410.750" offset="21642971">This statute which I read doesn't profess to do that, it doesn't profess to lay down any standards of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5416.435" offset="21665646">And as a matter of fact the Florida court didn't base its theory on any minimum contact theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="5422.152" offset="21688529">And I submit that the Delaware court was entitled to take that Florida decision as it would writ without minimum contacts and measure it against constitutional requirements to see whether it was right or whether it was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="5436.980" offset="21747879">It wasn't incumbent on the Delaware court to delve around the theories of all sorts to see whether the Florida court might have relied on those theories but didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="5446.960" offset="21787794">But passing that, passing that and coming down to the minimum contact business, the Delaware trust company, as appointee of $400,000, it was the trust company of a trust, as to which the decedent had no -- nothing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5470.943" offset="21883716">The decedent wasn't the settlor of the trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="5476.126" offset="21904405">The decedent wasn't the income beneficiary of the trust and the trust was irrevocable.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.020" offset="21931990">So that the content which Florida had with the institution which now holds the assets and which held the assets as a result of the distribution which was made before the Florida suit has began.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.490" offset="21989878">The only contact which Florida has -- had there is because the beneficiary is under that trust resided in Florida, that's the contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.175" offset="22024673">Now, is a contact which those beneficiaries have with the trustee because of their beneficial interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="5512.660" offset="22050586">Such a contact as to permit a third party to come in and say that because of that isolated, insulated type of contact, a third party can hale into the Florida court and get, if you please, not in rem jurisdiction but as the Florida court said clearly, in personam jurisdiction, in personam jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.093" offset="22152359">I submit that that's not the kind of a contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5541.317" offset="22165211">It's not the kind of an evil which this Court was dealing with or considering in the McGee against Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5550.348" offset="22201365">Now, what was the contact which -- and I say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5553.513" offset="22214008">That in the absence of the Delaware trust company regardless of what contacts the Wilmington Trust Company might have had, in the absence of the Delaware trust company which holds those assets and held the assets when the Florida action was began, Florida had no jurisdiction to make an adjudication unless it had jurisdiction over the trust company and those minimum contacts I've described is more than sufficient to give it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5579.401" offset="22317558">Now, so far as the Wilmington Trust Company is concerned, the 1935 Trust was created when Mrs. Donner lived in Philadelphia in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="5594.686" offset="22378684">Nine years later, she moved to Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="5599.823" offset="22399269">She exercised of the first two powers when she lived in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="5605.076" offset="22420271">She exercised the third power when she was residing in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="5610.864" offset="22443363">She exercised it in Pennsylvania as shown by the Delaware record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5615.879" offset="22463425">And she exercised the fourth power in Montreal, Canada.</text>
            <text syncTime="5622.558" offset="22490175">And that's shown in the Gold affidavit which is not mentioned in our brief but is at page 295 of the Delaware record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5635.588" offset="22542315">Now it's true that Mrs. Donner did reserve a life interest in the right to exercise these powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5642.558" offset="22570214">But that wasn't a contact which she had when that trust was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="5648.844" offset="22595291">Wilmington Trust Company didn't go into Florida by any voluntary act of its own; it was taken into Florida, so to speak, when the settlor moved into Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="5661.552" offset="22646178">And I suggest to you again that that type of contact is completely different than the type of contact you have in a case like International Shoe where you have business being solicited by the defendant who would be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.134" offset="22700513">The type of contact you had in McGee against Insurance Company or the type of contact you have where you served a non -- a nonresident motorist to voluntarily come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5686.717" offset="22746802">Now, my friend may argue that -- that the Wilmington Trust Company could have gone into Court and asked to have been relieved of its responsibilities and that type of non-action resulted in its further contacts in distributing income, and let me say something about that in some sort of a contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5709.367" offset="22837394">But the fact of the matter is the Delaware record shows that there was no income sent down to Florida to Mrs. Donner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5719.296" offset="22877100">It was all put in the Wilmington Trust Company who worked out and the advisors of the trust in Philadelphia were informed of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5729.168" offset="22916598">The record also shows that when there were purchases and sales of securities, Mrs. Donner was never advised of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5736.914" offset="22947631">The information all went to these life long associates or her families in Philadelphia who were advisors of the trust and they were told about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5745.611" offset="22982426">When proxies were sent for execution, they weren't sent to Mrs. Donner after the banks had signed them for sending into the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5755.358" offset="23021401">They were sent to -- in Philadelphia, so that those contacts with Florida were of the minimal variety.</text>
            <text syncTime="5763.842" offset="23055360">And I suggest that this matter of -- of minimum contacts, if given the comprehensive scope which my adversaries would give to it, would result in this sort of a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5775.825" offset="23103216">Stockholder and corporation, many contacts between a stockholder and a corporation, proxy materials sent, proxies are set in, dividends sent and whatnot.</text>
            <text syncTime="5786.430" offset="23145639">Can it be said that that type of contact gives the State where the stockholder lives, jurisdiction over the corporation in any suit which would be brought against them, they're much more extensive than these contact are in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5802.635" offset="23210527">So much for minimum contacts as we see, we think that the doctrine of the McGee against Insurance Company which of course we filed to was a doctrine which was understandable, which was under a statute which prescribe standards of minimum contact, and did result in the avoidance or will result in avoidance of an evil of which -- which was -- which many of us are cognizant of these polices being written and the burden being put on a -- a beneficiary to chase.</text>
            <text syncTime="5840.670" offset="23362664">Now, let's pass the question of -- of jurisdiction and make the assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="5849.082" offset="23396310">That on some theory, the Delaware trust company and the Wilmington Trust Company, were brought in to Florida court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5857.830" offset="23431314">I think it can't be sustained for the reasons I have stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5861.952" offset="23447719">But if that position should be sustained, then I suggest that you have this further question, namely, whether Florida was wrong in applying Florida law to strike down a relationship which was valid under Delaware and whether or not, that error was not so vital and basic as to constitute a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5893.356" offset="23573420">Now this Court has spoken on that subject on several occasions and I -- I'm sure it's a little naughty problem because one time Court goes one seemingly on fine distinctions goes one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="5905.854" offset="23623367">But the case we rely on is the Hartford against Delta Land Company case, where there was fidelity bond written in the State of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5919.485" offset="23677910">That case, Your Honor, is referred to -- on -- it's 292 U.S. 143 and it's referred to on pages 29 and 30 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5935.598" offset="23742380">There was a case where there was a fidelity bond in -- written in Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="5942.384" offset="23769443">A defalcation occurred, a defalcation occurred in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="5952.698" offset="23810717">The plaintiff was a Mississippi corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5956.884" offset="23827435">The defendant was an out-of-state corporation but both were doing business in Mississippi where the defalcation occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="5966.000" offset="23863902">The bond contained a provision which limited liability after a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5973.635" offset="23894518">That provision was good in Tennessee where the bond was ready.</text>
            <text syncTime="5977.236" offset="23908937">It was bad under the statutes and public policy of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="5981.459" offset="23925760">Mississippi therefore said, “Plaintiff can recover on the bond.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5986.329" offset="23945300">The case went to this Court and this Court reversed saying that the contract was a contract which had its intimate relations with the place where it was written and that law and not Mississippi law was controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="6007.318" offset="24029205">We suggest that -- that this relationship which was created, which I call a trust and my friends call an agency in Delaware was a much more static and less ambulatory or transient type of relationship than you have in the case of a fidelity bond which ensures persons against losses all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="6031.933" offset="24127634">And by a fortiori reason, by a fortiori reason, the principle of the Hartford case would apply to this situation and that it was wrong for the Florida court to cease all the Florida law to strike down a relationship which was valid in the State where it was entered into.</text>
