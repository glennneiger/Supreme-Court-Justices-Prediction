            <text syncTime="193.889" offset="775523">Well, is it fair to say that the cases before us on the pleading, leaving one side the problem that was amended, it is a Section 3 case.</text>

            <label>Mr. John B. Tittmann</label>
            <text syncTime="201.459" offset="805825">It is purely a Section 3 case on the pleadings now before this Court and has so been treated both by the court below and by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.922" offset="851592">I would like to address myself briefly to the reasoning of the Court of Appeals of the Tenth Circuit and for your information, the prior authorities which were available to that court and also the court of the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.100" offset="936333">The decisions on this question in the District Courts were very limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.946" offset="955768">There are only two outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.629" offset="966426">Our Court of Appeals relied upon Judge Yankwich's decision in the Balian Ice Cream case in California which was cited in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.522" offset="998087">Adapted its reasoning and based its decision on that wholly.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.995" offset="1019925">After that decision, our District Judge, Judge Rogers analyzed that case and decided contrary specifically and our Court of Appeals overruled him but the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit relied on Judge Roger's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.375" offset="1085440">So we have two conflicting District Court decisions and they are the only ones of any importance because they are the only ones that analyze or attempt to analyze the problem and two conflicting Circuit Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.245" offset="1136953">Now, all of those courts had assumed that the position was sound that the definition of antitrust laws as used in Section 1 of the Clayton Act was exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.192" offset="1200692">Judge Yankwich, as well as our Court of Appeals took that position so that any litigant trying to recover for a violation of Section 3 alone of the Robinson-Patman Act have to somehow establish that it was one the antitrust laws for which the Clayton Act in its Section 4 created the treble damage remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.892" offset="1311556">Otherwise, they were faced with the problem that is I think well accepted law if our Congress creates a new offense and fixes the penalty, that is the penalty and unless a violation of Section 3 can be brought within the definition as being an antitrust law defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.892" offset="1411553">There is no private treble damage remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.211" offset="1424823">The remedy is exclusively to criminal, fine and imprisonment provided for in that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.321" offset="1453244">Now to do that, Judge Yankwich and our Circuit Court, talked about whether it amended or not and used that term in a very broad sense of whether it is generally in antitrust field.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.735" offset="1522939">Whether it adds something to the congressional effort to control monopoly and to regulate restraints against commerce and we submit that one of the fallacies of both Judge Yankwich's decision and our court, is if they are using a term, which I think Mr. Justice Frankfurter suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.822" offset="1635265">It is not helpful because its only use is to by calling something amendment you therefore assume that it is within the definition and the argument that if this amends, it automatically -- Congress automatically intended it to be within a definition and therefore to have a treble damage remedy, we think solves the question by assuming the answer and that the answer must be found in Congress' actual intention regardless of the term amendment as to whether a violation of this Act should have a private treble damage remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.956" offset="1831811">And we submit that the entire course of the Act that it was adapted.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.137" offset="1876532">The actions of Congress in other examples subsequently indicate that it was not that intention.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.537" offset="1934106">I do not want to review again the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.108" offset="1956362">I would be repeating mostly what Mr. Williams has said but I would like to point out that this question of whether there is treble damage remedy for violation of Section 3 was before Congress and was discussed on the floor but only in this sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.106" offset="2044343">Representative Celler was opposing the bill because he believes the penalties were too strict.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.203" offset="2068793">He did not want a criminal penalty on the businessman for the same Act for which he is subject to treble damages, an Act by the way that is common, can be common competitive practice selling at a lower price and to become the very malodorous criminal activity that Section 3 seeks to reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.313" offset="2181224">It has to be characterized by some very bad purpose and the purpose can be a matter of degree so it is a very vague and indefinite offense in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.647" offset="2230544">But every time in Congress when the question of treble damages for violation of Section 3 occurs, it was always the same act of discrimination, the same act of discrimination can violate both.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.341" offset="2297313">Now the first clause of Section 3 deals with discrimination in illegal discounts and the discounts, and the quantity discounts and the discrimination in price were what Congress was concerned with and there is no where any discussion or even adverting to sales that are unreasonably below prices for the purposes of injuring competition and what that might mean.And nowhere is there an indication that Congress intended that if a man sold in unreasonably low prices for the purpose of enduring competition which by the way is this Section 3 as its ancestor in the Canadian criminal code that has been dictated in the brief that nowhere do they indicate that that type of thing is going to be subject to a treble damage remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.222" offset="2516846">Now, that -- the failure to realize or the failure to specifically bear in mind that the same act, same violation which could create both remedies, was always a discriminatory act prohibited by both Sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.028" offset="2604095">The -- the same matter is referred to by this Court in the opinion of Bruce's Juices in which case the purchaser of cans was seeking to avoid the payment of the balance due because of the fact that he only received a 1% discount for buying 500,000 cans a year or $500,000 I believe whereas some of his competitors received the 5% discount for buying a million or more, whatever the figure is.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.516" offset="2761979">This Court in the opinion made a remark that a violation of the Clayton Act and Robinson-Patman Act created a remedy, civil remedy for treble damages and did not distinguish.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.720" offset="2834808">Well, it's true that if in illegal discounts where an illegal discrimination would violate both Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.603" offset="2878380">The violation would bear treble damage remedy but not under Section 3 as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.841" offset="2899278">That case is of course cited as authority for the position counter to ours and we take the position that the remark was not necessary to the decision in that case in its dicta but again, as illustrative of the danger of not distinguishing between the act of discrimination that violates both Sections and whether or not a civil remedy is created by both Sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.762" offset="3022994">That opinion pointed out that the violation that it referred to had to have two sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.671" offset="3062596">Well that's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.572" offset="3066253">That's true with the discrimination but it's not true of Section 3 because Section 3, under the last clause, could have one sale at a tremendously unreasonably low price for the purpose of destroying competition in that area and that would be it.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.821" offset="3143262">Therefore, we believe that the problem presented to this Court cannot be solved by the use of mere words such as amendatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.740" offset="3198955">I don't think it's a good tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.849" offset="3207314">It's what Congress actually did in enacting his legislation and that also present --</text>

            <text syncTime="819.019" offset="3276069">I might point out that in the remarks or even on the Florida House.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.151" offset="3304594">One of the Representatives was objected to combining these two Acts and that's what Congress did.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.209" offset="3324761">They combined two Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.316" offset="3333224">He was willing to vote for Section 3 alone but he was not willing to vote for them in the same bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.231" offset="3360914">And his characterization was that this is a hodge-podge.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.417" offset="3377633">He further indicated and I think I'm close enough to quote him.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.550" offset="3402188">The courts will have the devil's own time resolving the inconsistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.852" offset="3431340">What happened was that the Patman bill was introduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.713" offset="3454851">The Borah-Van Nuys language was rejected by the House but included in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.625" offset="3486407">You had in effect two Acts separate and distinct, attempting to reach generally the same purposes and the Borah-Van Nuys language was left in to get an Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.518" offset="3541995">And I think it was Representative Patman who's testifying before a congressional committee on this very subject in 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.450" offset="3577731">It's the language in citation that's here in the brief, he testified before the committee that Section 3 was included just for that very purpose to get a bill and that it had never been carried as one of the antitrust laws and that in his opinion it should be and that he hoped in 1950 that Congress will do something about it and amend Section 1 of the Clayton Act to specifically include it.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.457" offset="3693819">I would like to advert briefly to the opinion in the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.453" offset="3733734">The basis -- one basis of which was and again they were using this word amendment, which I do not consider it very helpful method of solving the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.494" offset="3789949">But they took the position that the Robinson-Patman Act in its entirety amended the Clayton Act, therefore was in antitrust law, therefore treble damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.027" offset="3848046">But the reason they took that was that there was no enacting clause in the Robinson-Patman bill other than at the beginning and the opinion in the Tenth Circuit appears in the record beginning at page 32.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.473" offset="3937802">They base there wholly in part anyways on the fact that bill only had one enacting clause is hereby enacted that Section 2 of the Clayton Act is remanded to read as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.802" offset="4027141">And that since they didn't have an enacting clause on 2 and on 3 and on 4, that 2, 3 and 4 under one enacting clause therefore had to be an amendment as characterized in the enacting clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.045" offset="4088163">It is significant I think that no other Court has ever used that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.859" offset="4107389">It may be significant that no counsel in this litigation anyway has attempted to rely on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.957" offset="4143752">The answer I think is to be found in the brief of the Carnation Milk Company in the previous case that the enacting clause of any bill in Congress, the form of it is set by law and it only includes, be it by Senate Congress and simply or something be it enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.027" offset="4248033">And the enacting clause form of it does not contain the purpose of the Act so that that particular ground of our Court of Appeals decision, we submit, is without any foundation and particularly because in addition to fixing the form of the enacting clause, the laws, Congress has adapted specifically provide that it shall only appear once at the top.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.084" offset="4368300">I mean it is not permissible as a matter of congressional form to have an enacting clause preceding every Section.</text>
