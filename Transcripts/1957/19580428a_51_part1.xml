            <text syncTime="841.505" offset="3365930">The essence of the Government's position can be briefly summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.596" offset="3382335">Initially the opinion of the District Court requiring turn over rested on three ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.762" offset="3406994">First, that the United States had been using and was using the grand jury transcript to prepare a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.904" offset="3439595">Second, that it would be useful to the defendant to have the grand jury transcript to prepare their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.549" offset="3466136">And third, traditional reasons for grand jury secrecy no longer apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.286" offset="3489123">At the outset, let me make clear that there's no question whether the United States was using transcripts to prepare a civil case.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.288" offset="3521097">Indeed the attorney general is obliged once the grand jury has been lawfully convened and properly conducted to make use of evidence it adduces in the fullest performance of those public responsibilities Congress has placed upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.582" offset="3586299">Beyond that we have no reason to disagree that access to the transcripts would be one useful tool for defendants to prepare their case.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.530" offset="3622034">Indeed, this would be likely be so in every complex civil case following a grand jury investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.083" offset="3652232">Our sole disagreement with the court below stems from our view that the basic integrity of grand jury process requires that with limited exception, secrecy surround that testimony given before even beyond the grand jury's discharge.</text>

            <text syncTime="939.761" offset="3759020">From this it follows that each exception to the traditional rule of grand jury secrecy must be based on a delicate balance between on the one hand, the reasons underlying the rule of the grand jury secrecy and on the other, the need of a civil defendant for a particular bit of testimony for a particular purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.574" offset="3846269">This delicate balance, the court below does not deem it necessary to undertake.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.590" offset="3866331">The Court concluded that there were no reason which had survived the grand jury's life, which any longer support of the need for secrecy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1073.920" offset="4295680">As this Court stated in the United States v. Johnson, and reiterated only recently in the Costello case, entered role to the administration of federal criminal justice that the institution of the independent grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.914" offset="4351582">Indispensable to the grand jury's function, it follows that the ability to compel on travel disclosure by witnesses before it of all data within their knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.642" offset="4394527">Such ability would be dissipated we urge, where witnesses to know their testimony would be disclosed even short of trial to those very person on whose witnesses economic existence depend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.989" offset="4455863">The call from this Court's opinion in United States v. Johnson, intrusion into the indispensable secrecy of the grand jury as important for the protection of the innocent of the pursuit of the guilt would subvert the grand jury secrecy -- would subvert the grand jury's function by all sorts of devices which some state's opinion could permit such as (Inaudible) inspection of grand jury minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.068" offset="4560248">From this involved that the Government's position basically is that the basis of integrity in grand jury process requires that secrecy surround testimony, even after the grand jury's discharge absent any but the strongest and most particularized sort of showing that basic justice requires to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.751" offset="4650945">That sort of showing for the Government's view was not made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.440" offset="4669753">Initially at the time motions were made for access to the grand jury minute, defendants conceded that they knew the names of most if not all the people that testified before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.569" offset="4722207">Beyond that, the record is barren of any efforts by defendant to secure via deposition an alternative means to learning the facts within witnesses present knowledge to secure by alternative means such as deposition, relevant facts within grand jury witnesses, present knowledge was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.262" offset="4809038">There was no effort that they tried the deposition route.</text>

            <text syncTime="1460.956" offset="5843801">First, at trial, when the Government gets the trial, if it does, will not much of what went on before the grand jury to be revealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.157" offset="5880581">There are three answers to that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.369" offset="5893433">First, the great bulk of civil antitrust cases do not reach trial, roughly 75% are settled before trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.914" offset="5927602">Second, even as to those cases that reach trial, a crucial element of prosecutor's judgment is the balance between on the one hand, the need to call a particular witness to make a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.665" offset="5978593">And on the other, the need to protect a particular witness from economic harm that may come to him by putting him on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.032" offset="6012029">Third, even if the case is trialed and even if it becomes necessary to use a particular witness, then left in a very carefully exercised discretion of the Court at the expense to which that -- particular witness' grand jury testimony will be exposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.446" offset="6077753">So Mr. Justice Brennan, I suggest that in practical terms, the use -- the proceeding by the United States to trial or prosecution of the civil case does not in effect constitute a waiver or intrusion into the secrecy of grand jury --</text>

            <text syncTime="2431.335" offset="9725283">I -- I would respond by first reciting very briefly the chronicle of events on which the defendant's contention depends.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.894" offset="9759556">The District Court in April of 1956 had rendered its opinion saying the United States would be obliged to turn over the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.080" offset="9788291">After denying the United States' motion for reconsideration in July of 1956, the court on July 24th, 1956 entered its first turn over order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.572" offset="9838237">The July 24th, 1956 order specified or obliged the United States to turn over any and all grand jury transcripts within 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.677" offset="9886616">Some eight days before that July 24th order, 30-day deadline was to expire.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.092" offset="9912320">In short, on August 16th, of 1956, the United States moved alternatively to stay the order's effectiveness so its validity could be tested on appeal, or to amend the order to specify that if the United States did not produce the transcript, the complaint would be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.689" offset="9990687">The reasons for that motion stated by an affidavit that the Attorney General submitted at the time the August 16th motion was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.783" offset="10027050">He said, “It is my considered judgment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.827" offset="10035304">It would be unseemly for the Chief Law Enforcement Officer of the United States to be placed in the dilemma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.334" offset="10061322">Either of having to comply with the court order which he considers erroneous and compliance with which he deems contrary to public interest or alternately they would -- being required to disobey the order without first having an opportunity for effective appellate review of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.096" offset="10136346">The Government's motion was brought on for argument soon after it was made on August 16, defendants acquiesced in the Court's amendment with July 24th order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.305" offset="10181172">The order was amended August 21st to provide that if the United States did not turn over the transcript, the case would be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.821" offset="10215236">When the August 24th deadline expired, the Court wrote defendants as well as the United States to determine if in fact the transcripts have been turned over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.989" offset="10259853">When the Court determined that the United States had failed to turn over the transcript, the September the 13th dismissal order from which the United States here appeals were entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.786" offset="10303112">Against this background of event, the United States replied to defendant's contention has three (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.076" offset="10332264">First, that the United States appeals not from the August 21st amended order but rather from the September 13th dismissal order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.924" offset="10367687">The September 13th dismissal order in turn was not the inevitable result of the August 21st order, instead it was the inevitable result of the United States' failure to produce in response to the August 21st order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.993" offset="10427873">Second, regarding the August 21st amended order, our position is that the United States did not consent with the substance of the August 21st order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.481" offset="10465907">Indeed, on two occasions it had sought with all its vigor to object to the substance of the turnover order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.306" offset="10497149">Instead, it sought merely to have the Court in advance of the order's deadline specify what the remedy for noncompliance would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.101" offset="10540304">This is a -- this Court said in Thomsen and Cayser is known -- thus, as this Court said in Thomsen and Cayser, the plaintiffs did not consent to a judgment against them but only that if there was to be such a judgment it should be final in form, instead of interlocutory, so that they might come to this Court without further delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.824" offset="10627239">This case -- the Government's position here is even stronger than the plaintiffs in Thomsen and Cayser because the other remedies the Court might have applied would have enabled the Government likewise to appeal and indeed appeal with far less drastic consequences to the Attorney General qua litigant in this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.645" offset="10702576">For example, had the District Court held the Attorney General in contempt and had he appealed, and had the Circuit Court or the Supreme Court later agreed that the District Court was in error, or was not in error, or sustained the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.642" offset="10762553">Then left for the United States would again be the choice whether or not to comply or abandon the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.078" offset="10784287">We've given up that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.635" offset="10790452">The Attorney General chose for himself a path that had no advantage to him as a litigant, specifying the remedy of dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.259" offset="10820963">And his sole motive was to avoid the unseemly situation of the Attorney General of the United States applying a Court order.</text>

            <text syncTime="2880.046" offset="11520104">There are two separate questions involved in this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.369" offset="11533375">Although both are aspects of the administration by federal trial courts of what has come to be known especially in the antitrust appeal as the (Inaudible) case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.213" offset="11572767">The first question is as to whether the Government is entitled by the simple device of the voluntary dismissal to seek review of an interim discovery order, which in no way affects the ability of the Government to continue the prosecution of its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.670" offset="11642671">Now, the second question is the merits of the order production of the grand jury minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.199" offset="11664718">Since there are three of us arguing on our side as a plan of argument subject of all -- it was of course to the approval and the wishes of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.638" offset="11698469">I shall address myself to the first the question, General Royall will follow to address himself to the second, and Mr. Fortas will sum up any remaining aspects of both questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.200" offset="11744758">Now, if the Court please, at the outset they're certain of the facts which have been adverted to you by counsel for the plaintiff, the appellant, which need to be stated a bit more fully perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.599" offset="11806302">As has been stated the original discovery order here was ended in July 24, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.653" offset="11834514">It was a usual form of Rule 34 order in the sense that it directed plaintiff to produce the grand jury transcripts for inspection and copy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2968.889" offset="11875474">The Government, although, consenting to the form of the order at time it was ended, stated that it -- then there that it did not propose to comply with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.105" offset="11916330">Defendants thereupon stated that they would wait the 30 days provided by the order for compliance and if at the end of that time the Government continue to adhere to its position that it would not comply, they would take such action under the rules as they were then advised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.208" offset="11984771">No one, the Court, the Government, or the defendants suggested at that moment, that is on July 24, 1956, what action should or would be taken in the event of ultimate non-compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.884" offset="12043494">Now, thereafter, on August 16, 1956 as has been stated, before the expiration of the 30 days, plaintiff brought out a motion asking that the original order of July 23rd, directing the plaintiff to produce be set aside and that they be substituted for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.612" offset="12118413">An amended order proposed by plaintiff, which would provide no direction upon plaintiff to do anything but simply would provide that the action would be dismissed unless plaintiff had produced the transcripts by August 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.077" offset="12180271">In proposing this amended order, the plaintiff asked in the alternative but we think it's significant only as a second choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.287" offset="12221127">That is in -- the plaintiff said in the event that the Court does not see fit to enter plaintiff's proposed amended order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.135" offset="12244532">Then and only then, plaintiff asked the Court for a stay of its original order of July 23rd, 1956, in order to permit the filing of an appeal by plaintiff from that original order or the filing of an application for an extraordinary writ or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.439" offset="12325721">Now, defendants entered no objection to the plaintiff's motion and the Court accordingly granted the plaintiff's first choice and ended the proposed amended order in substitution for the Court's original order of July 23rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.081" offset="12384235">Now, if the Court please, thereafter, has -- has been noted the court below wrote to all the counsel for the parties, including Government, to find out after July 24th whether or not the Government had turned over the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.125" offset="12464483">And, the Court said, this was pursuant to the Government's amended order, and the Court went on to say, if the transcripts have not been introduced, I shall dismiss the action pursuant to the amended order of August 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.879" offset="12539507">Now, if the Court please, the effect of these procedural maneuvers of plaintiff, if they are upheld is one, to deprive this Court of the opportunity of passing upon the renewability of the original production order, whether as a matter of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.314" offset="12617247">The complainant originally said they might appeal that or as a matter of an application for the issuance of an extraordinary writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.684" offset="12650684">Now, additionally, the procedure followed by a plaintiff would have the effect, if again is validated of requiring this Court to review the discovery order on the basis that if the order is sustained, the action is dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.650" offset="12714527">Now, we submit, if the Court please, the plaintiff was under no compulsory to adopt this course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.843" offset="12739291">It was perfectly clear that the court below would have entered the stay proposed by a plaintiff as its second choice and it thus enable the plaintiff to seek review in this Court of the original discovery order.</text>

            <text syncTime="4149.089" offset="16596323">Mr. Correa has well represented the aspect of the case relating to the dismissal of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.478" offset="16637910">My presentation will be directed to the question of whether the production order was a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.183" offset="16680647">The complaint in this case alleges antitrust violations extending since 1926 and it covers practically every aspect of the business of these defendants without residing them, of their selling, their promotion, their patents, their surveys, their meetings, their conferences, their embroiders, very elaborate territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.558" offset="16838217">And that includes and is intended to include a large number of oral conversations that was developed in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.327" offset="16893283">In this -- pursuant to this complaint, the plaintiffs subpoenaed scrolls of thousands of papers embracing hundreds of thousands of sheets of papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.785" offset="16991086">And their preparation which the trial judge commented on not too favorably during the trial extended over a period of five years before this order of production was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.862" offset="17087425">The plaintiff admittedly used the grand jury transcripts first in bringing the action and framing the allegations of the complainant so stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4288.783" offset="17155030">It used then in the preparation of the case and stated that they intended to use them during the remainder of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.297" offset="17221172">In a public announcement, the Department of Justice said the filing of this complaint results from a careful and thorough investigation of the industry including extensive grand jury proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="4362.171" offset="17448647">Now, from 1951 on this investigation and the lawsuit in the further preparation continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.641" offset="17486472">And as far back as 1954, the trial judge said, “One of my concerns is since the plaintiff has been preparing this case for probably three years.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4386.258" offset="17544986">That was two years before this order of production.</text>
