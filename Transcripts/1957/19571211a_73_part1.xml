            <label>Mr. Warner W. Gardner</label>
            <text syncTime="30.607" offset="122358">May it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="33.734" offset="134896">This case is here on writ of certiorari for the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.938" offset="167706">That court set aside orders of the Federal Maritime Board, approving a so called contract rate system proposed by the Japan-Atlantic and Gulf Freight Conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.247" offset="256940">A contract rate system is broadly an agreement by the member of lines of the steamship conference that they will contract with the shippers in the trade, so that in return for a promise to ship only by member lines, the shippers will be charged this smaller freight, here nine-and-one-half percent less than the rate charged non-signatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.825" offset="387239">By pre-hearing stipulation of that order, the review of the boards orders confined to the fact as found by the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.487" offset="433946">The trade involved is the trade from Japan Okinawa and Korea to the United States Atlantic and Gulf ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.102" offset="476369">The important movement is from Japan to the North Atlantic ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.854" offset="499357">The trade is overtonnage that is too little cargo moves for the 330 odd sailings made each year and all vessels carry substantial empty space on their inbound journey to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.920" offset="583680">The trade is served by 18 steamship lines operating a regular or berth liner service.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.963" offset="623804">All except one, the respondent Isbrandtsen here, are members of the conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.390" offset="657554">The stated purpose of the conference is to establish and maintain agreed rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.869" offset="691409">Any line regularly operating in the trade may become a member of the conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.807" offset="731220">Until March of 1953, the conference operated to prevent rate wars, to preserve rate stability and regularity of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.663" offset="790570">In 1949, Isbrandtsen entered the east bound trade from Japan to the United States Atlantic ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.163" offset="840620">Isbrandtsen, as a matter of policy, refuses to join conferences and quotes rates which are ordinarily 10% below the conference rates, whatever those rates maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.452" offset="917734">So long as it is thus freed of rate competition from conference members who adhere to their agreed rate, Isbrandtsen can, by its 10% differential, attract substantial cargos away from its competitors and to its own vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.364" offset="1005401">In each year, from 1950 through 1952, Isbrandtsen on the average loaded more than three times the amount of cargo that was loaded by the average conference line vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.999" offset="1079902">The conference lines considered that they must take protective steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.117" offset="1112398">The conference accordingly, in December 1952, filed with the board, a proposal to inaugurate a contract rate system upon the approval of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.695" offset="1178749">After notice, the respondents here entered protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.941" offset="1203722">The board sent the case for a hearing, but refused to suspend the contract rate system pending that hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.245" offset="1244891">The court below first restrained and then enjoined that interlocutory order holding that the contract rate system could not be inaugurated even provisionally without full approval of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.553" offset="1330155">The conference, in March 1953 with its contract rate system restrained, voted to open rates on 10 major commodities, that is to leave each line free to make the Isbrandtsen competition by quoting its own rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.112" offset="1420434">Within a short time the rates on all significant commodities in the trade had been opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.776" offset="1455020">The rates fell to about one-third of the March levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.289" offset="1477068">On a number of commodities, the rates were well below the costs merely of loading and discharging the cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.693" offset="1518759">There was, in short, a full fledged rate war.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.889" offset="1535478">Isbrandtsen dropped out of the rate war in May of 1953 and has since carried little cargo in the trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.299" offset="1581140">This is not a shipper's paradise.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.740" offset="1594932">While the rates are low they are fluctuating and unpredictable.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.279" offset="1617084">There is no assurance that competing sellers will not have different freight rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.251" offset="1644983">Forward buying becomes a gamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.620" offset="1658462">United States inventory values are made thoroughly unstable.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.095" offset="1680300">Orders were postponed.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.875" offset="1695451">In fact, the shippers, while believing that the March 1953 rates were too high, have requested the conference to close its rates and it testified in the hearing before the board that they considered the nine-and-a-half percent differential to be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.964" offset="1799837">The contract which the conference lines have here agreed to be submitted to the shippers is to be read against the tariff published by the conference which contains two rates, the contract rate and the non-contract rate, with the rate for contract shippers' nine-and-a-half percent below the non-contract rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.282" offset="1905058">The actual contract agreed to be submitted to the shippers has these salient provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.386" offset="1941525">The shipper agrees to forward all shipments by conference line vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.648" offset="1970573">The carriers agree to maintain a service adequate to meet the reasonable needs of the trade and to carry the goods so far as regular vessels are available and they note that they will always be available in this overtonnage trade 330 sailings a year, but should they not be, the shipper is released from his obligation to use only conference line vessels and the conference liability maybe put to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.854" offset="2111321">A shipper, who breaches his contract and patronizes a non-conference line, is to pay his liquidated damages, 50% of the contract freight rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.204" offset="2164715">Either party may terminate on three months notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.979" offset="2187912">Rate decreases are effective immediately, rate increases two months after the end of the calendar month in which they were noticed.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.085" offset="2244336">The board held four hearings and filed a comprehensive report covering 50 pages of the printed record here starting at page 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.244" offset="2284878">Its salient findings were these.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.761" offset="2302955">The contract rate system is necessary for the survival of the conference and necessary to preserve rate stability and regular service in this trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.653" offset="2366589">The nine-and-a-half percent differential, the board found to be reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.964" offset="2391771">It is generally accepted by the shippers to protect the conference lines against undue diversion of traffic to Isbrandtsen and yet will not drive Isbrandtsen from the trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.738" offset="2450913">In fact Isbrandtsen is about 7% of the sailings in 1953, who probably, the Board found, carried 10% or somewhat more of the traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.446" offset="2505770">Their well and short be that many shippers who will find it advantageous to use Isbrandtsen charging rates 10% below the contract rate and when necessary to supplement Isbrandtsen's fortnightly service to pay the full contract rate, to conference line.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.796" offset="2603154">Possibly a arithmetical example will make that a little clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.039" offset="2620082">If you assume a contract -- a non-contract rate of $33 a ton, the conference proposes to offer to the shippers a rate of $30 a ton if they agree to patronize the conference line.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.207" offset="2688731">Isbrandtsen on past performance and on the basis of the announcement made to the trade will reduce the $30 rate by another 10% making it $27.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.849" offset="2747350">Accordingly, for a number of shippers it'll be advantageous to pay $27 to Isbrandtsen, when they can use the Isbrandtsen service and $33 to the conference when they're forced to use conference vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.502" offset="2821956">Other shippers, and undoubtedly the majority will find it advantageous to pay the straight $30 to the conference who will accordingly sign the contracts proposed by the conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.551" offset="2886113">The Court of Appeals, on review, held that the board had no power to approve a contract rate system.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.223" offset="2936790">Its reasons were given in two opinions, in each of which all three judges joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.577" offset="2962286">Judge Fay said that the contract rate system was condemned by Section 14 Third of the Shipping Act of 1916, as a retaliatory and discriminating method resorted to because the shipper had patronized another carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.105" offset="3032398">Since we consider it was absolutely banned, the opinion continues that it's immaterial that the contract rate system maybe desirable, or that it maybe reasonable or that it's objectives maybe consistent with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.209" offset="3104810">Judge Washington added that the exclusive patronage contracts which were known to and impliedly proved by the Congress when the Shipping Act was enacted, for what he considered to be bona fide requirement contracts, quite different from those at the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.058" offset="3188193">We must start with Section 15 of the Shipping Act of 1916, printed at pages 77 and 78 of the Board's briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.497" offset="3233959">Section 15 requires that all agreements between carriers be filed, including those fixing or regulating transportation rates or fares, pooling earnings or traffic, allotting ports or regulating the sailings or volume or character of freight, and also those agreements giving or receiving special rates, privileges or advantages, and those controlling, regulating, preventing or destroying competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.139" offset="3400516">The Board is directed to approve any such agreement, unless it finds it to be unjustly discriminatory or unfair, detrimental to the commerce of the United States or in violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.124" offset="3452447">Approved agreements are accepted from the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.712" offset="3474808">The Shipping Act does not, the Court will note, enact a limited exception to the antitrust laws as does the Interstate Commerce Act, but moves along a broad car, very far in precisely the opposite direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.584" offset="3546279">No other statute enacted by the Congress, has ever gone so far away from the policy of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.029" offset="3592046">The statutory recognition of agreements controlling, regulating, preventing, or destroying competition is not an exception to, but in the field of ocean shipping is a reversal of the antitrust principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.380" offset="3665502">The explanation of Section 15 is not hard to find.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.045" offset="3684101">From 1875 onwards, when the steam engines had made regular liner service, the order of the day, it has been painfully evident that rate competition is almost inevitably destructive of ocean transport service and almost inevitably favors the large shippers over the small.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.811" offset="3787233">We show in our main brief the economic forces which inexorably drive competing ocean liners into rate wars, in which only the largest and the strongest line can survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.265" offset="3841045">It's sufficient here that the congressional committee which in 1912 set out under its resolution to investigate whether any such ship lines had formed any agreements preventing or destroying competition, ended up after long and careful investigation by authorizing just such agreements, these were the same men who contemporaneously were strengthening and expanding in fields other than ocean transport, the antitrust laws by enactment of the Clayton Act and the Trade Commission Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1009.810" offset="4039158">In 1915, the Second Circuit held that the so called dual rate system was not violative of the Sherman antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.990" offset="4083879">In 1917, this Court on a triple damage suit reached the opposite conclusion.</text>

            <label>Mr. Warner W. Gardner</label>
            <text syncTime="1030.060" offset="4120137">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.012" offset="4124003">The government's suits became moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.498" offset="4133930">One private triple damage suit survived and was decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.287" offset="4165068">I want to repeat the committee's reasons which must be remembered if the Shipping Act of 1916 is to be intelligible to a court, which is more familiar with the Sherman Act than with ocean trade rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.146" offset="4220552">Rate competition, the committee found, means rate wars, which in turn means the death of the weaker line and favoritism to the large shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.245" offset="4268931">Yet rate regulation by a single government was impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.092" offset="4312294">Having found rate competition intolerable and rate regulation impossible, the Congress provided a supervised conference system by which the carriers, subject to governmental protection against abuse, could reach rate agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.811" offset="4383242">Basically the question before this Court is whether the Congress, in 1916, intended that the conferences, they were thus establishing and making their main reliance for control of ocean shipping, were to have some capacity or none at all, to protect themselves against dissolution in the face of outside competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.783" offset="4487105">Specifically, the issue in this particular form is whether the contract rate system is forbidden by Section 14 Third of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.202" offset="4528797">That Section is printed at page 76 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.166" offset="4560562">It enacts four categories of offenses, each punishable by a fine of $25,000 for an offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.323" offset="4601208">Fourteen First, forbids deferred rebates precisely defined by the statute, as meaning giving a rebate for exclusive patronage, both during the agreed period in which it accrued and a further period of deferment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.744" offset="4686890">Fourteen Second, prohibited fighting ships, again precisely defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.846" offset="4719282">Section 14 Fourth, prohibited miscellaneous unfair practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.132" offset="4744464">Section 14 Third with which we are here concerned, admits, as a matter of grammar of at least three readings, literally it can be read, to make it unlawful to resort to discriminating methods for any reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.839" offset="4835265">This would contradict or make surplusage virtually the whole of the Act and is urged by none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.511" offset="4869956">The Court below and the respondents temper this extreme literalism and read two qualifications into the broad prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.676" offset="4914678">It's unlawful, they say, to retaliate against any shipper by resort to other discriminating methods because that shipper had patronized any other carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.493" offset="4985940">This reading of the Court below, makes Section 14 First complete an unnecessary surplusage, that the Congress thus intended by Section 14 Third to outlaw all expressive patronage rate inducements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.589" offset="5062322">It hardly found it necessary to make the detailed and precise condemnation of one deferred rebates which is found in Section 14 First.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.483" offset="5113835">We say the statute should be made consistent and surplusage is voided by carrying a gist in generous, one small step farther, so that it is unlawful to retaliate against any shipper by refusing a space accommodation or resort to similar discriminating or unfair methods, because such shippers patronize any other carrier or for any other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.457" offset="5233789">Under our view Section 14 Third is concerned with the denial of space or service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.063" offset="5264196">It is in that view unimportant here, whether or not a contract rate system could ever be called retaliatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.329" offset="5301290">That word is however important that Section 14 Third should be thought to reach to rate making.</text>

            <text syncTime="2091.739" offset="8366916">I would like to say in addition to what Mr. Gardner has told you that the following appears in the Alexander Committee Report which appears on page 161 of this joint appendix presented by the two government departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.043" offset="8460121">It's contractual shippers which maybe classified as follows, A) Joint contracts made by the conference as a whole, such contracts are made for the account of all of the alliance in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.556" offset="8518217">Each carrying its proportion of the contract freight as tended from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.956" offset="8539742">The contracting lines agree to furnish steamers at regular intervals and the shipper agrees to confine all of his shipments to the conference steamers and to announce the quantity of cargo to be shipped in ample time to allow for proper supply of tonnage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.099" offset="8612362">The rates on such contracts are less than those specified in the regular tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.298" offset="8637127">But the alliance generally pursued a policy of giving the small shipper the same contract rates as the large shipper i.e. willing at all times to contract with all shippers on the same terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.567" offset="8702224">The way that that appeared is a -- was accurately stated by Mr. Gardner, perhaps I should like to emphasis it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.584" offset="8742243">The carriers would produce pursuant to the subpoena or request of the Alexander Committee a contract which they had made say with the International Harvester Company at a certain rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.094" offset="8796369">Then they would be asked whether or not that same contract at the same rate would be open to other shippers of agricultural influence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.927" offset="8839628">The answer would be if they sign the contract, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.639" offset="8858540">And the question is what would they pay if they didn't sign the contract, and this was an exclusive patronage contract, the answer was they would pay then the regular tariff rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.737" offset="8906919">Now this -- there is no question about that that the Alexander Committee thought of such contracts and I think that after looking at the reply brief of the Federal Maritime Board with its 70 illustrations, I don't think there is any question that any one -- any reasonable person will be convinced that they actually did see that sort of contract and that they didn't condemn it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2253.304" offset="9013185">Well as I understood Mr. Gardner's hindsight was that the contracts that were before the Alexander Committee did not have interns, there was provision in the contract between the hearings whatever they extended themselves from 15, 16 whatever it was that there was no provision in the then outstanding contracts of the conference explicitly stating the lower rate for exclusive patronage, is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="2518.791" offset="10075115">That was the only difference but in substance there was actually no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.825" offset="10103223">There are a couple of points of fact that I would like to dwell on for a moment before I discuss the legal aspect of this thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.181" offset="10152647">Mr. Gardner I think fail to give to the Court the impression of the extent to which Isbrandtsen's rate cutting does diminish the carryings of the conference lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.683" offset="10226730">By 1953, after this had gone on for three or four years, Isbrandtsen's vessels were carrying three times as much Japanese cargo per vessel as the conference lines and I'd like just to canvas with you for a moment what the effect of that sort of difference is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.249" offset="10312934">The business of ocean carriage is one what the economists call a business of increasing profits or decreasing costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.662" offset="10362567">A ship is a tremendous carrying inflexible entity, and if you start that ship on its voyage you incur all of the expenses by way of crews' wages and subsistence on fuel and the overhead item such as depreciation, if she is full or if she is empty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.692" offset="10458697">The result is that if you pass a certain breakeven point on your costs, over and above the actual cost of loading and discharge, the more cargo you carry, the more profit you make and correspondingly the less cargo you carry, the greater your loses are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.876" offset="10543438">Therefore if you have the apparent anomaly that Isbrandtsen while charging 10% less than the conference, is making good money whereas the conference lines by carrying less than the breakeven point at a 10% higher rate are losing and losing very heavily, the evidence was here $500,000 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.439" offset="10649704">Another thing I would like to bring out is what is the nature of a conference?</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.256" offset="10673006">A conference is not a monolithic unit by any means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.488" offset="10693904">The conference agreement in this case demonstrates that their only common interest is in fixing rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.585" offset="10734237">They do not pool earnings, they do not fix sailings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.109" offset="10752418">They have no common interest by way of stock holdings and when they get through with fixing the rate, from that time on, they are the most vigorous competitors and that competition takes the form not of cutting rates, as long as the conference is not subjected to this sort of competition, but in the matter of service and today in these trades we have vessels that are capable of making 18 and 20 and greater speed than that, I'm speaking of knots, whereas in the days when the first conference here was organized they were happy to have a 10 knot steamer and only three a month and today as Mr. Gardner said they have 300 a year, that is the effect of eliminating rate competition and bringing into effect competition by way of service.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.626" offset="11134433">Now and therefore when Mr. Gardner said that as the Board found, the conference might carry approximately 90% of the cargo if the dual rate system was in effect and Isbrandtsen 10%, to find out what the individual conference line would average you would have to divide the 90 by 15 and you will see that Isbrandtsen would come out better even if we had the contract system in effect so far as carryings are concerned, although they would not have the tremendous advantage that they did -- that they have had up to the time when this great competition came in, when they were carrying three to one over us.</text>

            <text syncTime="2895.192" offset="11580709">Having passed over that -- those economic features, I'd like to consider with you something of the broad basis of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.197" offset="11628774">Now Mr. Gardner says it travels in the up direction which is opposite to the direction of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and I'd like to examine with you for a moment why that is necessarily so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.028" offset="11700036">When you come to ocean shipping, as contrasted even with such public service companies as the railroads and the telephone company, you have to deal with different nationalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.761" offset="11770984">In the course of every voyage, let us say in the Japan, Atlantic and Gulf trade, you have not alone the laws of Japan to take into account, but also the laws of the United States and vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.107" offset="11828349">In addition to that, we have engaged in this trade vessels of many other nationalities who have treaties of friendship and commerce with us and when you come to the matter of over tonnaging which Mr. Gardner expressed, when you come to the matter of that kind, you find that our government is not able to deal with the problem at all because we cannot shut our ports to the vessels of friendly countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.153" offset="11976516">The only possible way that we could deal with over tonnaging is by telling the American flag vessels that they should stop serving this American trade and that is directly contrary to the primary objective of Shipping Act 1916 and Merchant Marine Act 1936.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.669" offset="12062616">The next problem where the international phase comes in is the matter of rate fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.110" offset="12100336">We cannot fix rates by government edict in foreign commerce as we can in interstate and domestic commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.057" offset="12140147">Let's assume an illustration, let's take the -- a case suppose our Federal Maritime Board would say that the minimum rate on goods, on Chinaware should be $30.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.981" offset="12211827">And suppose the Japanese government would say that the maximum rate should be $25.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.019" offset="12236069">By then there is only one way that you could possibly dispose of that sort of an argument and that is by arising to the diplomatic level and having our consuls or diplomats get together to decide what rates should be charged in the carriage of goods from Japan to United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.896" offset="12335543">Now in all other countries, in all other countries, this problem has been dealt with by the meeting together of the ship owners and determining what the rates should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.934" offset="12403670">In all countries except Japan, which moved along our lines under the American post war influence, those conferences are without regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.683" offset="12454661">And the countries, the governments depend for the protection of the shippers on the enlightened self interest of the carriers because they know that if they charge rates which will put the Japanese merchant out of business here, that the German merchant will get the business and our vessels will carry even less cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.295" offset="12553091">Our answer, our answer to that problem is the, is the matter that engaged the attention of the Alexander Committee back in 1912.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.243" offset="12600947">And they came up with the answer that we cannot, we cannot outlaw conferences because if you do -- you are not alone going to have non-conference competition of one against all but every -- every carrier is going to be at the throat of every other carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.665" offset="12706586">And the committee said that they were convinced that in such a situation they -- that the large carriers would survive and the smaller ones would be driven out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.636" offset="12778475">Whenever you have such a situation prevailing in a public service field, it's always the small man in business who gets the worst of it and the big man who can hold out in this bargaining field who can get the best rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.616" offset="12862380">And that is the testimony before the Alexander Committee that the, that where there was open competition, it was in the interests of the big and contrary to the interest of the small carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.304" offset="12925179">Now I would like to go with Your Honors for just a second on this Section 14 Third which was the, the statutory enactment that caused us the trouble in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.402" offset="13029564">As Mr. Gardner said that he didn't think that there was any other evidence in the statute as to what might possibly be the kinds of physical common carrier facilities which might be denied by way of retaliation, but I think that if we will drop down to the next section which is Section 14 Fourth, and which does not setup a per se violation but only a discretionary violation, it says, “make any unfair or --” this is on page 2A in the appendix of our brief, I think it's the easiest way to find it, 2A.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.848" offset="13247321">It says “Make any unfair or unjustly discriminatory contract with any shipper based on the volume of traffic offered or unfairly treat or unjustly discriminate against any shipper in the matter of A) cargo space accommodations when the same are available,” there we find the same language as we had in subdivision 3rd due regard being had for the proper loading of the vessel, “B) the loading and landing of freight in proper condition, and C) the adjustment and settlement of claims.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.942" offset="13407713">Now there we have two illustrations, they certainly are not all inclusive but there are two illustrations of cases in which a carrier could, retaliate against a shipper in matters other than rate discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.278" offset="13501022">And may I say this, Your Honors that Mr. O'Connor in his brief has cited a case, the Alaska Steamship Company case and I don't think it's got too much to do with this case, this situation, but it does have a great value on this point, it is a perfect catalog of ways in which a shipper can retaliate against a carrier, I am sorry, a carrier can retaliate against a shipper in matters that have nothing whatsoever to do with rate matters, a rate adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.139" offset="13692552">Now it's our position if the Court please that even if, even if Section 14 Third should be read as the court below read it so that it would condemn retaliation because a shipper had entered into a freight contract it still would not justify any holding that the dual rate system is illegal per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.407" offset="13825567">And that is true for this very simple reason that whenever anybody enters into any kind of a contract, the man who contracts obtains an advantage for which he bargained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.018" offset="13876036">The man who doesn't contract does not obtain the advantage, question retaliation, ordinarily not, because that may have horses to sell and the man who buys them and pays the price gets the horses, and the man who doesn't, isn't retaliated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.760" offset="13943014">When you come to the situation of a, an exclusive patronage contract then you might have a closer question and I think there motivation will enter in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.511" offset="14001946">If the carriers here had in mind the punishment of some carrier, some shippers who had been patronizing outside lines in a -- some penal manner I would say then yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.831" offset="14071223">In fact you have retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.227" offset="14084807">In our case our good friends specifically asked the board to make a finding that there was retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.375" offset="14117407">And there was a factual finding that there was no retaliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.178" offset="14136633">And not only did the board refuse to find retaliation but they actually found that there were good business reasons, reasons in our own self interest whereby we would put this system into effect, and why?</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.124" offset="14212493">Because as against the cut rate independent competition it would enable us to get for our 15 lines who are directly in this trade approximately 6.5% of the business on the average among them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.043" offset="14296085">It wouldn't work out that way evenly because as I said there are strokes whereas the court found, I am sorry the board found that is Isbrandtsen would retain at least 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.546" offset="14354181">Now I would like next to consider in the very few minutes that I have before me, have before me, some of the cases that are decided in this Court and which I believe unless they are reversed require a decision in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.259" offset="14425025">And the first one is the United States Navigation against Cunard Steamship Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.815" offset="14459193">In that case -- that case came up to this Court on a private antitrust -- in a private antitrust suit in which an injunction only was added, it was requested no damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.918" offset="14523664">In that case a dual rate system was alleged.</text>

            <text syncTime="3687.836" offset="14751242">I think they have been mistaken in all their answers to the Court's inquiries, until I make an attempt to lay before this Court a picture of just what this system is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.590" offset="14810279">Now the main issue here is whether or not a common carrier in the ocean trade, obligated to take every shippers' cargo within their capacity, can and in concert charge two shippers two different rates for identical transportation, being the same in every respect as to the type of cargo, the quantity of cargo, the distance involved, loaded at the same port, discharged at the same port, handled under these very same conditions, placed even on the same ship, whether or not they can do that under the 1916 Act or under any provision of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.032" offset="15032111">Of course they couldn't do it in common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3760.370" offset="15041411">That was definitely held in Thompson against Kaiser which just before the 1916 Act held that the system was illegal in ocean transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.503" offset="15097940">Now, the only consideration for the lower rate is the agreement by the shipper to give his exclusive patronage to the conference lines and to boycott any other line, an independent line such as Isbrandtsen which is the only independent line in this trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.159" offset="15196578">There is no question of volume involved, Section 14(a) handles that and would restrict any dealing with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.346" offset="15229283">There is no question of frequency of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.122" offset="15264392">We say and have said from the beginning for ten years, that it just cannot be done, whether it can be accomplished by precise legislation which has already been drafted we understand, is a serious question which we shall met when we come to that bridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3838.940" offset="15355716">To start out it's a price fixing arrangement among these carriers, and in addition to that you have the tie-in arrangement, both of which are fundamentally unlawful under our laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.773" offset="15435024">Now it maybe the Section 15 permits these companies to get together and fix prices, uniform rates, that was the purpose of it, that was the purpose of the Bulwinkle Act for railroads to get together, but there is no provision that they could fix two rates for the same transportation services and in no other form of transportation is that even attempted to fix tour rates under an exclusive patronage contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.485" offset="15581936">Now it says in Section 15 permitting this extraordinary privilege, and this limited immunity from the antitrust laws, that they may even destroy competition, but it is not even claimed by the Board that they can do more than destroy competition among themselves, and not destroy any outside competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.555" offset="15690188">And because of these theories and this testimony before the Alexander Committee, not a report just testimony, stands for anything, it shows repeatedly if there was attempt of Congress to spray limits that it was the intent to preserve independent competition; that, that runs through it and the other theme running through the whole historical background which they call is there shall be no retaliation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3981.055" offset="15924140">They were not given service, they were charged higher rates, they were not given service to particular ports, they couldn't pick the ports to which they were to ship their goods and so forth and I don't believe retaliation here is used in the ordinary sense of like for like as the Board would have it, and the Court below of course went into that and said retaliation here is doing something to a shipper because he will not surrender his fundamental right to do a certain thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="4048.549" offset="16194142">Reading the statute and seeing what the aim was to protect shippers and you go through Section 16, 17 you will find other provisions against discrimination, against preferences and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.552" offset="16266136">Now the court below found that the Board had no authority to approve such a system and even in the Swayne &amp; Hoyt case which has been cited to you as some authority which we dispute for a decision in this case, that court said that this system which is known not as a contract rate system as counsel as said, it's generally known as the exclusive patronage contract, non-contract, dual rate system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.456" offset="16409809">It was created in 1923 in this country, seven years after 1916 Act and it was not enforced in any extent by conferences till the 30's.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.435" offset="16469682">Now, it's just a substitute as the Supreme Court said in Swayne &amp; Hoyt, for the outlaw deferred rebate system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.185" offset="16520673">Now gentlemen these conferences are nothing less than cartels and the (Inaudible) cartels, they are known as cartels.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.356" offset="16569365">The latest book on this subject is by Professor Marx of Gartner International Shipping Cartels, in England they are know as shipping rings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.439" offset="16625685">Now the only system ever used before 1923 other than the referred rebate system which we have outlawed made a crime, was the contract system, and you notice that's all counsel said, the contract system, a contract of shipment, whereby the shipper agreed to send his goods exclusively by the particular line of the conference lines in consideration of a certain rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.469" offset="16773851">Now one of the justices, I think it was Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in the contract used by this conference, whether or not there was any provision as to two rates whether there is or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4210.278" offset="16841038">On page 203 of the joint appendix, you will find that the contract which the conference submits to the shippers refers to -- gives them the contract rate, and of course that implies that if they don't sign up they'll pay the non-contract rate, which of course is in this instance substantially 10% higher and some shippers said well it'd put out of business, that's our margin of profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.410" offset="16957544">Some rates run to $200 a ton that will be $20.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.046" offset="16976144">Now this conference going the other way, outbound, which is the profitable trade, that's why the homeward bound ships, the same ships are overtonnaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4257.186" offset="17028702">The conference going the other way of the same line substantially to file these to conference, they only charged a flat rate of $4 a ton.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.583" offset="17070289">We claim not only is this system unlawful under Section 14 of the 16 act, we claim is unlawful under Section 15, 16 and 17 that's unlawful under the anti-trust laws which still persists because of the limited immunity in Section 15 and this act as unlawful under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.837" offset="17167256">The court below of course having arrived at this illegality under Section 14(3) saw no occasion to discuss these other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.979" offset="17203827">In all there were five questions submitted to the Court of Appeals which we considered, but we believe here that there should be due respect of the court an earnest consideration of these other questions which we submitted to the court below and especially in any case that there is an attempt to revive this system, in 1936 there was an attempt to revise this outlawed dual rate system and in 1938 there was an attempt to legalize it, to revive the deferred rebate system and in 1938 there was an attempt to legalize the dual rate system, this is exclusive package system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4347.166" offset="17388565">Now all these petitioners or appellants have to stand upon, and had to stand upon for 10 years during which we have been in this ligation and two implications admittedly they have nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4364.371" offset="17457424">They claim that this system was impliedly approved by the Alexander Committee because it was not condemned and I practically quote their language and they say it was also impliedly approved by at least two decisions of this Court because it was not specifically condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.559" offset="17566198">And of course they will not argue that it was ever an issue before this Court or before any other court because counsel for board and the board chairman have admitted that issue has never been before this Court and the court says this as they cited this quote, well merely cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.680" offset="17662642">Some of you distinguished justices will recall upon these conference case in 1952 was merely a case of primary jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.469" offset="17705796">Likewise the Cunard referred to here in 284 US was merely a case of primary jurisdiction both sent back to the board for exhaustion of administrative remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.181" offset="17764624">And the Swayne &amp; Hoyt case so called which had some dictum, admittedly dictum by the chairman of the board, did not have the issue as to the legality of this system before it, merely whether or not it violated Section 16 of the act as to unjust discrimination between shippers and the court affirmed the decision of the Maritime Authority that it did violate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4472.323" offset="17889280">Now that's all, those are the weak reasons to which they cling throughout these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4477.556" offset="17910178">For 10 years we've struggled.</text>
            <text syncTime="4481.635" offset="17926478">Say – we use grants in Departments of Justice and Agriculture have struggled to get a definitive determination of this issue and we have been brought that every move by a claim of primary jurisdiction would been brought by the conferences and we have been brought principally by the Maritime Board which in each case has sat as the judge in – at least I (Inaudible) as it were.</text>
            <text syncTime="4512.362" offset="18049358">But it's been the most active appellant mover for certiorari to stop any upsetting of this cartel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4529.786" offset="18119053">Well as to the Alexander Committee report as important, on the first page of it, board counsel and department of justice admit the submission of these extracts carries with it no implication as to its relevance or significance in the legislative history of the shipping act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.584" offset="18230335">Outside of that it can be taken for whatever word can be found in it, whenever company has any legislation it was a just a summary by a paid employee of certain testimony would be forced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.741" offset="18314867">The committee back in 1912 the members of which did not survive to enact the law in 1916 and when counsel for the board says it was a summary by the committee, he innocently mistakes the summary by a higher employee of the committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="4621.400" offset="18485499">I am afraid that no member of the committee, the changes were so great and the time had lapsed nearly four years, no member of the committee had much to do with this writing because they had a professor, professor of transportation Mr. Huebner from University of Pennsylvania and he sat down and he attempted to summarize and you have been read to use something about -- the deferred rebate system of course was a hardship but the contract system he didn't say that the committee found, he said it was argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.079" offset="18648294">Now in five places in the board's brief they drop out the words, ‘it was argued' and it was left to this Court, language quoted as if the committee itself said or found that the ordinary contract system, and notice the language ‘the ordinary contract system.'</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.394" offset="18741499">Now you've had Section 14 (3) written.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.272" offset="18765009">Now the court below in these two separate opinions found that to retaliate against a shipper because he would not sign the exclusive patronage contract was the one of the methods of retaliation referred to in the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4711.793" offset="18847138">In addition of course if after citing you patronize a non-conference independent operator, he would be fined 50% of the freight which he would have paid to conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4724.451" offset="18897711">There was no suggestion that steamship lines make 50% of freights they take in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4736.220" offset="18944836">Now an important point in here, over the years it's been said well, all discrimination must be unjust, unreasonable, and as we point out the history of this legislation puts the words ‘unjust' in every section except Section 14 (3) and the history of the legislation of various views that went through the process and is finally adopted, it is clear beyond question that those qualifying words were deliberately left out of Section 14 (3) because of the intent desire of Congress to prevent retaliation of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4787.561" offset="19150158">Now Section 15 would be reason to disapprove the section, the system, Section 16 which forbids, which forbids giving any undue or unreasonably preference or advantage to any particular person, Section 17 all common carrier shall charge any rate, was unjustly discriminatory between shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4816.297" offset="19265097">Now let me address myself to the others, substantially which we couldn't even get the board to pay any attention to us about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.819" offset="19307207">We claim that this system is fundamentally illegal because it informs the signing of the shippers' contract between the conference or the conference on behalf of its lines and a shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.638" offset="19386514">And such a contract is not granted any immunity under Section 15 of the act because a shipper is not a person subject to the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4858.056" offset="19432176">Only person subject to the act carriers and forwarders can enter into a combination or conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.130" offset="19472509">Now when the -- the means of carrying out this system is this contract, printed at page 203 of the joint appendix, between the conference and the shipper whereby he agrees to patronize those lines exclusively, the other side brushes it aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.599" offset="19566341">They don't immediately – even their brief says oh that's just a contract carries out -- enter in to a contract with shippers, sure they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4901.880" offset="19607510">On the ordinary system they on every shipping transaction, they enter into a bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="4908.926" offset="19635618">And they do here where they use this exclusive patronage system but in between that and the agreement of a set up of a system, there is a contract entered into between the conference and the shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="4928.450" offset="19713776">And that contract is never filed for approval and has never been approved by the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.566" offset="19774171">Likewise we contend and is a very serious question that if by any possibility such a power was lodged in the board, as placed by the proponents of the system, it would be an undue delegation of power to the board without the fixing of proper standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4967.035" offset="19868108">And further than that and worst, it would be -- it is further delegated by the board to the conferences under what they call self regulation to determine whether or not the conferences shall be put a non conference independent carrier out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4993.867" offset="19975419">Let me quote to you what the board itself and the chairman think about this system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5005.584" offset="20022335">It's only recently they claim it, if this isn't intended we would stand for monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5011.943" offset="20047726">In the first case we brought back in 1948 to test this question, Isbrandtsen case before a statutory court in New York which ultimately came here in 342 US 1952, board counsel made this statement which Judge Frank quoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5035.994" offset="20143961">“That the purpose of the dual rate provisions was if possible to bring about a condition in which an independent carrier,” such as Isbrandtsen, “could be compelled through loss or threatened loss of profits either to join the conference or go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.686" offset="20210730">If a contract system is wholly effective, it will result in a complete monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.904" offset="20231523">Necessarily, in these circumstances, there would be no service by independent operators.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.596" offset="20254302">Isbrandtsen is the American flag line competing against 12 foreign liners, eight of them Japanese lines and the board's chairman said in a decision, coming down in just about the same time, a decision in this particular conference case, “in considering an application to institute a dual rate system in any trade, we must recognize the immediate purpose of the system simply stated to be the elimination of non conference competition as such.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5098.804" offset="20395154">Now, well, that's what Congress intended and they wasted lot of language in the 16 act trying to protect shippers and trying to protect independent operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="5114.240" offset="20456908">Now over the years the board and the champions of this cartel system have had two alibis as it were, have been expressed almost ad nauseam.</text>
            <text syncTime="5130.306" offset="20521169">Some of us simple people claim that it even in (Inaudible) intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5140.416" offset="20561607">They say first the shipper who refuses to sign up can do so if he wants to, can't he, can't he sign up, not so preventive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.995" offset="20603925">Well, of course the board itself in the early 30s when they used reason (Inaudible) ridicule that silly alibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="5158.591" offset="20634331">And the second is that Isbrandtsen is an independent, he could joint the conference, can't he, not to prevent them, but of course (Inaudible) imagine that the victim of Alibaba and his 40 thieves might have had that opportunity to join up to become that 41st.</text>
            <text syncTime="5181.102" offset="20724402">But surely in this land of ours, there's no such as this compulsory joining to save one's skin, but that wouldn't even help a large segment of this trade, which is another serious consideration here because clamp operators, bulk carriers, comprise a tremendous portion of our foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="5208.518" offset="20834011">They compete with these conference lines and the conference lines always cite their competition when they come in and ask for permission to use a dual rate system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.466" offset="20877793">And under the act, clamp operators are not permitted to join a conference because only common carriers could join.</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.898" offset="20923559">Now as I say for ten years we have struggled against this matter down to a position of a definitive determination on the fundamental issue involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5247.402" offset="20989597">So that's why we are here again today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5250.508" offset="21002031">We were here five years ago, and the Isbrandtsen case went off on another tangent, we won it but didn't go to the fundamental legal question.</text>

            <text syncTime="5316.958" offset="21267749">And in the 62 conferences which use the system, in only three of them is there any independent competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5325.628" offset="21302439">So they sign up all shippers but the real purpose of the system is to deter any independent entering a trade that's what that board calls potential competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.336" offset="21353326">So even on the board's own criteria of preventing monopoly, stability of rates, there was no instability of rates here or to meet independent competition, there is no situation in this case and even the chairman said to prescribe that -- to guess that Isbrandtsen would get 10% in this trade if this system was set up was a pure hazard, just looking into a crystal ball, no one had the right to make such an estimation in any trade.</text>

            <text syncTime="5509.575" offset="22038256">I speak for the United States and for the Secretary of Agriculture, whose contention it is that the order of the Federal Maritime Board approving the dual rate system proposed in this case by the conference rests upon errors of law and should therefore be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="5531.016" offset="22124042">As Mr. Gardner has stated, all parties accept the facts as found by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.440" offset="22153718">Our disagreement is solely as to the legal consequences of those facts, the central fact in the case being of course, the nature, the purpose and the effect of the dual rate system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5553.327" offset="22213277">At the outset I should state very clearly, that the essence of that system is an agreement among carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5563.280" offset="22253087">It is an agreement among all the members of the conference that they will charge two sets of rates to shippers for precisely the same transportation service, costing exactly the same to the carrier, having the same value to the shippers involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5585.604" offset="22342322">They will charge two system, two sets of rates depending solely upon whether the shippers have agreed to give all of their business for the indefinite future exclusively to the conference upon penalty of a 50% liquidated damages provision and where it is admitted by the conference in tendering this system, this agreement among themselves to the Board for approval, and where the Board itself recognizes that the purpose of this arrangement among the carriers is to meet the competition of an independent carrier who for reasons of his own, desires to stay outside the conference and to be independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="5644.525" offset="22578051">The purpose of this arrangement is to compel that independent carrier either to join the conference or to suffer a very substantial diminution of his business, perhaps even to eliminate him from the trade entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5662.572" offset="22650253">That is the dual rate system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5665.043" offset="22660075">It is a phenomenon which is unique to the maritime transportation industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5670.545" offset="22682122">It is unknown in any other mode of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5674.004" offset="22695915">It is not used by carriers or groups of carriers by rail, by motor, by air.</text>
            <text syncTime="5682.254" offset="22728934">If any such other mode of transportation attempted to use such a system on elementary principles of transportation law, not antitrust law but transportation law, principles of transportation law antedating Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 recognized a common law, under those principles, such a system would be clearly illegal, because it would involve charging shippers different rates for precisely the same service and the courts have -- from beginning of the regulation of public utilities and common carriers applied the principle that shipper A cannot be discriminated against in relation to shipper B for precisely exactly the same kind of service he receives from a common carrier, unless there is a difference in the cost --</text>

            <text syncTime="5879.759" offset="23518981">The reliance in this, in the legislative history and I think that there perhaps maybe some misunderstanding as Mr. O'Connor has pointed to this.</text>

            <text syncTime="5921.037" offset="23684075">The recommendations of the committee appear on the last ten pages of volume 4 of the Alexander report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5927.428" offset="23709675">What was has been read to Your Honors by petitioner's counsel is a summary of the recommendations made by witnesses before the committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="5947.372" offset="23789401">Now I don't think that that the materials referred to have any great significance even if they were directly the product of the committee itself, but I thought it's important to clarify that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5964.873" offset="23859409">The dual rate system as a system of excluding competition, as system for agreement among carriers is of relatively recent origin even in the maritime industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.383" offset="23917505">It came into common use in the 1920s long after the enactment of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5985.628" offset="23942478">In this particular trade, the Japan Atlantic trade, it appears for the first time, as the board found in its report in 1928, at that time it was limited to three commodities, in 1934 it was extended across the board to the major important commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6002.282" offset="24009038">With the advent of hostilities in 1941 all that stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="6008.436" offset="24033698">It was not -- the dual rate system was not resumed after World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="6014.943" offset="24059716">The respondent Isbrandtsen is the 18th the lone rugged individualist of the -- of this trade as in other trades.</text>
            <text syncTime="6030.034" offset="24120111">It entered this trade in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="6033.165" offset="24132650">It suffers under certain serious competitive disadvantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.980" offset="24155847">It has only 26 sailings a year as compared to 300 of the conference vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.082" offset="24188238">Its equipment does not match that of conference vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="6050.915" offset="24203598">It does not go the gulf course.</text>
            <text syncTime="6053.882" offset="24215510">So as the board found here any, any shipper or exporter from Japan who has a need for service more frequent than the fortnightly service offered by Isbrandtsen, who needs special shelf rooms or refrigeration service not offered by Isbrandtsen such a shipper has to use the conference vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="6077.340" offset="24309342">Despite that -- those handicaps Isbrandtsen in the years 1949 to 1953 was able to enjoy a very substantial share of the business here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6097.432" offset="24389695">It was able to do so because of its policy of consistently offering lower rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6104.621" offset="24418429">It was -- its policy was to offer rates 10% lower than those offered by the conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="6110.975" offset="24443820">As a result many shippers to whom that 10% difference was important used Isbrandtsen despite some of the disadvantages of doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6125.080" offset="24500245">The conference was thus confronted with -- to a very serious problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6132.262" offset="24528980">It responded to it in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="6135.153" offset="24540578">First in December in 1952 it proposed this dual rate system for the Federal Maritime Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="6142.277" offset="24569104">It proposed that that system which had not been in use since 1941 should again be instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6150.910" offset="24603585">The conference took another action, a very important action within three months thereafter before the Federal Maritime Board could take any action on this proposal for a dual rate system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6161.919" offset="24647576">In March of 1953 a proposal was made within the conference that it, that there be a 20% reduction of the conference rates in order to meet Isbrandtsen's competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6176.570" offset="24706194">That proposal was rejected, instead the conference decided to open the rates, that is that it would no longer hold any of the conference lines bound by the conference fixed rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6189.394" offset="24757499">The board found that the purpose of that action, the hope of the conference in opening the rates was that the rate war, which would thereafter ensue, would leave Isbrandtsen to join the conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="6204.586" offset="24818312">Or in the alternative that it would lead to the institution of the dual rate system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6209.962" offset="24839837">As a result of that rate war, Isbrandtsen, as Mr. Gardner stated, has effectively lost almost all of its business in this trade, nonetheless it did not join the conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="6221.739" offset="24886857">The conference succeeded, however, in its second phase.</text>
            <text syncTime="6224.892" offset="24899500">The Federal Maritime Board has approved this dual rate system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6230.907" offset="24923533">Now we contend that in doing so the Federal Maritime Board misconstrued the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6239.200" offset="24956761">It applied an erroneous standard of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6241.729" offset="24966896">We think that Congress in enacting this statute, as is stated in the last 10 pages of this joint appendix and the committee report itself, Congress found in 1916 that these shipping conferences or shipping rings had established domination over the shipping business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6264.766" offset="25059056">The choice before Congress was either to prohibit these combinations entirely, apply the principles of strict free competition or to legalize them entirely or without any restraints at all or a third alternative, the one actually chosen by Congress was to legalize these agreements, permit the conferences to get together among themselves fix rates subject to effective governmental restrain.</text>
            <text syncTime="6298.561" offset="25194162">Now in 1916, the problem of meeting non-conference competition was just as important as it is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="6307.228" offset="25228852">The dual rate system wasn't used because there were far more effective methods used.</text>
            <text syncTime="6312.499" offset="25249959">First most effective was a so called deferred rebate system whereby a shipper who violated his commitment to use all the vessels of a conference lost a rebate, a fixed rebate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6330.573" offset="25322266">Another method that was used was a so called fighting ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="6334.539" offset="25338149">That was a ship used by -- subsidized by all of the members of the conference, it went into a particular port where the independent was, it was equivalent to a lost leader and that ship consistently undercut the independent, so the independent either had to join the conference or go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6354.877" offset="25419442">Those were the crude but very effective methods that were in use in 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="6360.563" offset="25442220">The dual rate system was not in use.</text>
            <text syncTime="6362.793" offset="25451102">It is true as has been mentioned that there were contracts between carriers, individual carriers and individual shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6371.105" offset="25484330">Those were negotiated contracts for the most part.</text>
            <text syncTime="6374.323" offset="25497287">They varied in length of time, they varied in the differential, but the crucial difference, the essential difference is that those were not contracts among the members of the conference for the purpose of eliminating competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6391.714" offset="25566772">You will find what the board itself characterizes as a sample of such a contract on page 44 of its brief, brief with a light grey cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="6405.075" offset="25620271">And I must say in all honesty that we have not found any other contract precisely along these lines, it goes quite as far as being conference among more than one carrier, a contract between more than one carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="6426.662" offset="25706580">But assuming this is the best, this is the closest you can get to something evidencing a dual rate system prior to enactment of the shipping act, it falls very far from what we have here which is a conference agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="6442.852" offset="25771363">An agreement among the ship -- among the ship lines themselves whereby they establish two systems of rates, systems of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6449.481" offset="25797904">All this contract did on page 44 is a negotiated contract on behalf of named carriers specifying named rates for named commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6460.971" offset="25843879">And this one contains a firm obligation on the part of the alliance to provide space and as Judge Washington pointed it's all the difference in the world between a requirements contract whereby the seller makes a firm commitment as this space where space is important and when there is no --</text>
