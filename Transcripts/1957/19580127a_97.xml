            <text syncTime="318.388" offset="1273522">On April the 30th, 1953, the work of the R.F. Ball Construction Company was accepted by the housing authority that is the work under the Texas contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.631" offset="1330469">Between that period and the date upon which it was agreed as to the amount that the two -- the taxpayers under the Texas contract, the other two liens arose and all of the notices were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.488" offset="1401940">It was not until December, 1953 between December, 1953 and March of 1954 that any liability arose under the Kentucky contract that is the date that the payments were made by the surety under the Kentucky contract or from December, 1953 to March of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.599" offset="1518341">Now, the real question in this case seems to be whether, we can apply or we ought to apply the principles that this Court has announced in connection with lien cases and statutory liens of all types to a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.398" offset="1629518">There's no question and the court below found and held that the liability of the surety here arose subsequent to the date all of the liens were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.886" offset="1703497">Yet, distinguished the recent decisions to this case and surety clauses, the (Inaudible) nor the lien cases on the ground that there was a question of statutory lien while here, the liens arose out of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.393" offset="1789492">However, there was no lien at the time that the Government's liens were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.229" offset="1820839">The surety had no lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.948" offset="1835781">I have to say first though that among the tax writers, they all say this is a contrariety of opinion among the states as to how they would treat mortgages which provide for future advances and then the mortgages which were treated the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.481" offset="1933897">They do state and I think that this is in connection with this Court's admonition that the taxing statutes ought to be applied uniformly throughout United States and that the terms used in Section 3672 ought to be used in there or to be construed in their conventional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.764" offset="2042984">There is no conventional sense among the decisions as to the treatment of this type of mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.240" offset="2084885">The case cited on the surety's brief, Wright against Voorhees, an Iowa case, the last case in his index where the suit brought by a mortgagee against his mortgagor to recover two losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.553" offset="2190211">He had pledged a security for loans specified and paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.608" offset="2214348">The mortgagee defended on a condition which included any other indebtedness similar to the condition here.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.841" offset="2243291">And the Court held that to accept the mortgagee's decision would convert the instrument into a mere blanket mortgage having no reference to the subject matter referred to in the instrument, and the judgment in favor of the mortgagor was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.981" offset="2311837">Now most of the states hold that where there's an open-end mortgage, here, we have one that's sold from both ends and first I should perhaps say that where there is no security that security has promised which the Court hold in a case where there is an assignment of potential gross income or acquired property.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.289" offset="2437120">The lien, if it did exist, attaches to the act that acquires property when acquired but under the statutes relates back to the date of the execution of the instrument.</text>

            <text syncTime="677.703" offset="2710779">If -- if there'd be some questions in Your Honors' mind on the question of an interest in the property, I'd like to call attention to the decision New York against Maclay.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.319" offset="2785176">And there the Court was applying the priority statute provides statutes 3466.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.557" offset="2838152">It first held that an adverse lien of the State was in court and then questioned the correctness of the so-called mortgagee cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.962" offset="2903771">And referring to the mortgagee cases, it referred to the regular common law mortgage as distinguished from an equitable mortgage and it indicated there the possibility or perhaps I might seem to say the likelihood that the Government could take under 3466 ahead of the mortgage, a common law mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.870" offset="3015471">Evidently, the Court is not suggesting that you could take other people's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.769" offset="3035011">Here, the assignment is specifically for security.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.791" offset="3071164">Now, as I have said, the question really is, does the doctrine of relation apply against the United States in a contract of this type where admittedly, the mortgagee, as he calls himself, was not -- had no lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.487" offset="3177848">At the time the instrument was executed, he had no lien and certainly no court lien at the time the Government's first lien arose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.130" offset="4196519">And the -- the -- it seems not unreasonable, certainly, that Congress intended by mortgage to put the Government in a position where a junior creditor could not -- a credit -- a junior mortgagee that is one junior to federal tax liens could obtain upon what the Federal Government could not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1734.110" offset="6936346">Now, in order to get to that, let's get a brief resume of what the facts in this particular case are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.782" offset="6967066">On June the 26th, 1951, a contract for the construction of a housing project of over three-and-a-half million dollars was left by the San Antonio Housing Authority to R.F. Ball Construction Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.101" offset="7020356">R.F. Ball Construction Company was desirous of subcontracting the painting and the interior decorating, which he entered into a contract with Jacobs for approximately a quarter of a million dollars for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.786" offset="7079079">Jacobs then was required to put up a platform performance-bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.425" offset="7101649">And he applied to the United Pacific Insurance Company for this performance-bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.174" offset="7120666">And in consideration of them executing this quarter of a million dollar bond, he read -- he assigned to the United Pacific Insurance Company all of the retained percentages on that job, Your Honors are familiar with the --- where a construction contract where 10% is withheld each month from the amounts that are paid so that at the end of the time, there would be that sum for the protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.356" offset="7229336">Those retained percentages on the job were assigned in the following language to the bonding company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.440" offset="7261727">That Jacobs does assign, transfer, and convey as of this date as collateral security for the payment of any other indebtedness or liability of Jacobs to the company whether heretofore or hereafter incurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.555" offset="7354201">Now, is there anything wrong with that transaction?</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.732" offset="7362873">I believe Justice Whittaker calls attention that that is an everyday business transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.142" offset="7384503">It's done everyday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.111" offset="7392444">It's a perfectly legitimate and valid transaction whereby the bonding company can procure some security.</text>

            <text syncTime="1886.312" offset="7545208">Now, some nine months later, the surety incurred an additional liability on the Kentucky contract, which under the law and by contract, Jacobs was obligated to indemnify the surety against loss on that job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.407" offset="7613544">But that was a present obligation incurred by the surety on April the 4th, 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.752" offset="7646981">And it was a present obligation to pay subject only to be defeated or nullified by the performance of the principle which the principle never did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.533" offset="7706122">And whether what -- what -- is anything wrong with that transaction?</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.222" offset="7720856">Now, here we have the surety company with the retained percentages at that time and mind you, the San Antonio job had been going on for some nine months and presumably their retained percentages have been retained every month and that there was money on hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.371" offset="7793476">At that time of the execution of the Kentucky contract, you have a situation where there are certain funds supposed the San Antonio job had already been completed and this $13,000 was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.936" offset="7843736">And suppose immediately the Kentucky contract went sour and the bonding company had to take over at a lost of the $13,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="1978.092" offset="7912281">Now, what is the next step in the picture?</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.932" offset="7931716">The next step in the picture is that on April the 30th, 1953, the housing authority in San Antonio accepted the work of Ball, the general contractor which showed that all work, including Jacobs' work of painting and interior decorating had been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.623" offset="8006426">Now, just how long before that had been completed?</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.792" offset="8019069">It's not in the record but I assume that Jacobs' work had been completed for some time because it was the painting and the interior decorating and not landscaping which is the last thing on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.047" offset="8064104">Still, up to the -- and on April the 30th, it was agreed that on this Jacobs' contract, there were $13,228 of retained percentages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.297" offset="8121156">All right, what do you have there?</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.927" offset="8127634">There's still, not one single tax lien has been filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.004" offset="8143935">And mind you, that is against mortgagees, pledgees, purchasers, a tax lien is not valid until it has been filed, and not one single -- single cent of a tax lien has been filed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.199" offset="8204748">There's still no notice of -- notice of a tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.538" offset="8218122">The surety now, what was the situation now?</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.942" offset="8227736">The surety was obligated on its $36,000 Kentucky contract bond, and it had as collateral security to protect the assignment of $13,000 which was in the hands of Ball.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.237" offset="8284891">Now, thereafter, in May, June, and September of 1953 for the first time notices of tax liens were filed in accordance with 3672.</text>

            <text syncTime="2263.754" offset="9054981">Now, if it was a mortgage or a pledge, then on the 3672, it being prior in time, it is prior in length.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.757" offset="9095001">It's a -- if it is an outright assignment, then at the time of the filing of the tax liens, Jacobs, under 3670, had no property or rights to property in the fund to which the tax lien could apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.368" offset="9157381">The Texas law which created these and this is the law that prevailed.I believe, Your Honor, asked what law prevails on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.345" offset="9205342">This Court in the case of Morgan versus the Commissioner, 309 U.S. held that unequivocally on a very recent case from New York based upon that, held the same thing, that its state law, the Court explains, creates legal interest and rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.125" offset="9300428">The Federal Revenue Act designate what rights or interest so created shall be so taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.900" offset="9331566">So, under the Texas law, what is the effect of this assignment?</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.844" offset="9355285">I read from the Texas case of Southern Surety Company versus Bering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.441" offset="9373675">When this, as a part of the consideration for the execution of the surety bond by the appellant surety company conveyed and assigned under said surety company as security for indebtedness, then due by him to the company and any subsequent indebtedness which he might incur to it, any and all payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.092" offset="9460297">Funds, moneys or property due are to become due to him under his building contract with the press company, he is thereby assigned the bond in question in this case, the validity of the assignment is in no way affected by the fact that there was no bond in actual existence at the time that it was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.511" offset="9545979">Now, that's the Texas law that this Court said that must be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.246" offset="9568967">As early as 150 years ago, this Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice John Marshall in the case of U.S. versus Coy, upheld what is known in law as indemnity mortgages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.937" offset="9639706">There, a deed has been made to one Coy by one Fitzgerald who was a public servant of the United States Government to secure Coy from any liability that he might have -- might have to pay by virtue of his security to the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.328" offset="9729254">In consideration of the payment -- well, here is what this Court said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.649" offset="9766557">The deed is made to save Coy harmless on account of his having become surety of Fitzgerald to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.112" offset="9792366">All the covenants in the deed appeared to the Court to be fair, legitimate and consistent with common usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.236" offset="9816921">That is -- that has been the law of this Court for more than 150 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.454" offset="9837714">The law of Texas though is the one that prevails so we cite the Supreme Court of Texas on an indemnity mortgage where it says the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.495" offset="9869897">The desire to indemnify a security against loss was a sufficient consideration for the execution of the mortgages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.345" offset="9901349">Now here is what corpus juris says with reference to indemnity mortgages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.518" offset="9922038">It is well settled that a mortgage given by way of indemnity, that is not found on the present debt but meant to secure the mortgagee against loss or damage in consequence of any contingent liability or responsibility which he has assumed or agreed to assume for or on behalf of mortgagor and surety as bail, endorsed or otherwise is valid and be enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.522" offset="10006047">An indemnity mortgage maybe given to secure the mortgagee not only as against debts or liabilities for which he has already assumed responsibility or liability but also to protect him against loss or damage on endorsement, suretyships, or other liabilities which he may in the future entered into for the benefit of the mortgagor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.031" offset="10080026">Now, when Congress used the term that a federal tax lien should not be valid as against any mortgagee, pledgee, or purchaser, any mortgagee which is prior in time, what does it mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.267" offset="10173022">Does it mean nor we are eliminating indemnity mortgages from that -- that category of any mortgagee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.825" offset="10207295">No, we're going to eliminate that, and that is exactly what this Court -- what the Government in this case is contending in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.183" offset="10248673">Now of course, it could be said to be a pledgee in this case because it is -- it is cash, you might say, because these retained percentages have been referred to in by the decisions as just so much -- like so much liberty bonds.</text>

            <text syncTime="2586.554" offset="10346162">Well, of course, there couldn't have been any transfer of possession because the pledgor didn't have possession to begin with.</text>

            <text syncTime="2628.206" offset="10512823">After Jacobs made the assignment, he no longer had any property or rights to property in this fund to which the lien, the tax lien could apply under 3670, because the 3670 says that the lien shall apply only to property or rights to property belonging to the taxpayer and subsequent to the assignment, he had no such -- no such interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.930" offset="10623687">The Government would say that these principles that are of the Scoville, the Avery case, the New Britain, the Security Trust, all of those cases, not one single one of those cases had to do with contract rights, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.246" offset="10680947">They had to do with some state statutory lien such as a water-rent lien, a landlord's lien, an attachment lien, a garnishment lien.</text>
