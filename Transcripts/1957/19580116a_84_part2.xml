            <text syncTime="10.467" offset="41796">At the recess I was speaking I believe of the evidence of intent which is important, because we maintain that this is a jury question, a question for the jury to decide whether this man had decreed this position, the intent in his mind at the time he was approached by Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.356" offset="145345">And in that respect the evidence which I have read from the record I think conclusively proves that at the time he was first approached he was given an opportunity to say I have nothing to do with this traffic, but he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.767" offset="203024">He was like the merchant who when you walking and ask him for something says I don't have it, but come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.682" offset="230713">He's ready to sell it to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.914" offset="235624">It maybe an article he'd never even heard off, but he's convinced that he's able to purchase it and resell it at a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.499" offset="265927">Now that's what this man was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.527" offset="278047">He may not have had, and as he said, a ready market because -- a ready source rather, because his previous source he had had some difficulty with.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.199" offset="316709">But he thought he knew where he could get and he said to him come back and they exchanged telephone numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.992" offset="343876">And thereafter, the witness Marshall testified about further meeting at which they drove around Brooklyn looking and talking and discussing the possible sources of narcotics and how the petitioner had gotten out of his car and went around the block or around the corner and came back and said he thought he had seen someone.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.978" offset="731847">Mr. Masciale told me primarily he was a gambler.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.727" offset="742818">He was not narcotics trafficker as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.857" offset="755357">That his business was mostly gambling, but he knew the right people in the narcotics traffic and he said that up to a week ago prior, prior to January 14th he knew had a very good source which could supply me with excellent quality of heroin, but that somehow he had a falling out with these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.819" offset="827246">So he said that he had a source.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.180" offset="836650">I think you might readily infer from that he might have been in the business.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.823" offset="995265">I should think Your Honor that it is a fair inference that if you mean by initiated whether he asked the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.241" offset="1028911">He might not have asked him in so many words, can you get me narcotics, but he did say and he should tell me right away if he's not the person to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.542" offset="1066109">Now that certainly implies he is really asking, there is no -- I don't think there is much dispute about that, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.589" offset="1110309">Now the petitioner said he needed money.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.480" offset="1321900">He admitted telling Marshall that he needed money.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.691" offset="1321796">He needed money, because he had to pay his lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.307" offset="1321691">He admitted telling Marshall that he had learned about narcotics traffic through his big gambling contacts, although he did blame that on Kowel.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.185" offset="1321587">He admitted his gambling convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.235" offset="1321482">He admitted a conviction for conspiracy to rob on -- that was his direct testimony, and Seifert, the other actual procurer or the actual middleman testified that he was to make a $100 from this transaction and that he would take care of the petitioner and that he did give him $50. So there is some evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.580" offset="1338305">He admitted that he had prior been a gambler which connects with his first statement to Marshall and Seifert at least produced evidence stating that he had gotten money out of this transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.099" offset="1392327">So that when you take his admissions plus the evidence of Seifert, there is certainly some corroboration for the idea that he was telling Mr. Marshall exactly the truth of this original conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.542" offset="1470067">Now there were some subsequent conversations after January 14th and leading up to March 1st, the day when they finally made contact with Seifert who obtained and procured the narcotics on the 2nd of March.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.949" offset="1535791">Now in this respect of the petitioner did locate Seifert and --</text>

            <text syncTime="838.514" offset="3354018">As a matter of fact I believe that on the page -- record page 19, you'll find that Marshall was cross-examined about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.825" offset="3391216">Question; did he have a prior record, answer; none that I could find; none that you could find?</text>
            <text syncTime="852.372" offset="3409398">In other words, I looked it up or I checked it in our files and he had no previous conviction as to any narcotics violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.839" offset="3443252">I see so that you limited yourself to any narcotics convictions or that your record showed under the name Jack Kowel.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.102" offset="3472405">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.539" offset="3478152">Did you take his fingerprints?</text>
            <text syncTime="870.771" offset="3483063">No, I did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.534" offset="3490064">Now the defendant has testified that he knew this man Kowel under a different name, but at least as far as the government's check of the man Kowel under the name of Kowel it produced no records of having had any narcotic addiction or having ever been engaged in the trafficking.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.120" offset="3572402">Now as far as the testimony is concerned, the record indicates that the government did not know at the time of trial where Kowel was because he asked indeed -- in the cross examination the defense attorney asked do you know what the address of this Jack Kowel is, answer right now sir, question, at that time?</text>
            <text syncTime="915.989" offset="3663935">I did know at that time, yes sir, I cannot remember.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.965" offset="3675847">Now it was somewhere in the Bronx of Dunhill Road.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.659" offset="3686609">Would have it been 116090 (Inaudible) Avenue in the Bronx?</text>
            <text syncTime="924.743" offset="3698939">It could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.022" offset="3704059">I cannot be certain, I was there once.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.599" offset="3714299">Do you know where this person is now?</text>
            <text syncTime="932.357" offset="3729345">Answer the last I heard he was supposed to be in California somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.943" offset="3747736">Then there are questions about him being married and having -- and the witness answers he was married, his wife had tuberculosis, he had two children, and I think he had a boy and a girl.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.758" offset="3790994">He was afraid that the boy was also contaminated with the disease and the last time I saw him I think it was in the Spring of 1954 when he told me that his wife was due out of the sanitarium very shortly that New York was not the place for him and he got a job as a truck driver or something like that on the West Coast where he and his wife and kids would be much better off because of tuberculosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.447" offset="3889737">And the defendant cross examining asked as a matter of fact did not he leave his wife and children and go to the West Coast by himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.858" offset="3927353">The answer was, it is possible, I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.225" offset="3940833">So that, I think the record is clear here that the government did not know where Kowel was.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.561" offset="3966224">It was unable to produce Kowel and that is the reason why evidence was adduced to contradict the defendant in his own testimony of his relations with Kowel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.440" offset="4049711">Now the government seriously contends with respect to the other contention of the defendant or this petitioner which seems to be that he must escape solely on the basis of his own testimony of his relations with the informant Kowel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.539" offset="4158067">You see as I understand it is because he has had two horns here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.876" offset="4171442">One he says I was entrapped by Marshall and secondly he says, well, before I was even entrapped by Marshall I was entrapped by informant Kowel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.108" offset="4208431">Now the record isn't too clear as to exactly Kowel's position with respect to his employment, if you call it employment, by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.543" offset="4262139">That certainly leaves some doubt as to exactly when Marshall first met Kowel and whether at any time prior to January 14, there were any discussions with respect to the defendant Masciale and he did testify however as to the duties of Kowel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.312" offset="4357224">a question was asked on the page 16 of the record, were the duties of Jack Kowel to locate people who know something about narcotics?</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.600" offset="4394318">Answer not in the true sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.236" offset="4404872">There were other circumstances involved as far as Kowel was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.192" offset="4432666">So we are in an area there which there is uncertainty as to just when Kowel came into the picture as far as the government is concerned, but in any event he cannot escape on his own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.861" offset="4487419">In the first place, he has the burden of proving the entrapment and his testimony is a testimony of a defendant who has been shown to have been willing almost to the point of being anxious to please Marshall on the first contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.790" offset="4587102">He is a man who said that he knew of narcotics sources through his gambling context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.522" offset="4614060">He had been convicted twice of gambling and his whole defense was that, well I was entrapped by this man who is not here, the man the government couldn't bring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.899" offset="4695562">Now we think that the jury could have reasons to disbelieve the petitioner's own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.240" offset="4732865">In the first place, he is a party partly interested in the lawsuit and his own actions, as I pointed out, his actions and ready acceptance of the possibility of selling narcotics of his continued meetings with Marshall, and of the fact that he himself testified on one occasion, he even took $200 from Marshall and went out somewhere along and the statement of Marshall he is going to buy narcotics for me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.012" offset="4867971">And he came back and he gave the money back, but he explained that, he said, I just wanted to make it to appear that I was still interested in this, and he blames it all on Kowel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.514" offset="4909976">He says that Kowel wanted me to string him along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.711" offset="4922828">He wanted me to keep him going here, because it would hurt Kowel if I pulled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.835" offset="4947278">And so his -- all of his actions, everything he does he blames on the other fellow, but still the actions, are the actions of a person who is interested in getting narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.897" offset="4987507">Now when you get right down to it, he needed money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.985" offset="5003912">He admitted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.865" offset="5007360">The record shows he was paying for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.405" offset="5021571">He brought out on redirect Record 93 that at the time he was unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.287" offset="5045081">Now the petitioner even went so far on cross-examination, Record 86 and 92 to admit that Kowel was completely out of the picture when he first approached Seifert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.773" offset="5111014">Now if he was stringing Marshall along for Kowel's benefit and so forth, why would he then after Kowel was completely out of the picture, no longer had anything to do with this transaction as he so testified?</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.460" offset="5189799">Why then did he get Seifert and continue the -- and sell the narcotics, arrange with the sale of the narcotics, and he was active in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.357" offset="5233371">On the morning of March 2, he was present at the time the agents met Seifert and there were some discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.088" offset="5268271">Seifert wanted $400, the agents didn't know whether to give it to it and finally Seifert said, I'll take $200 and go get it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.891" offset="5299513">Well, he didn't know whether to trust him with the $200, after all he is the fellow they just met the night before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.051" offset="5324173">And the petitioner says, I'll vouch for you, I'll lend him my sister's car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.095" offset="5352281">And he gave him the sister's car and the agent and Seifert used the car to go locate the narcotics and finally picked it up.</text>

            <text syncTime="1710.064" offset="6840216">But, we say that in this case, it certainly was a question for the jury to decide whether he was in fact entrapped by Kowel and if they found that he was not, they didn't believe his story, then there was a further question from which they could find that he was as far as Marshall was concerned ready and willing to engage in the narcotic trade.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.901" offset="7163507">Defendant's case turns upon this question of whether he was induced being first otherwise not inclined to disobey this branch of the law that he was induced to do it first through interviews with this person who has known to us by two names, Jack Kowel and Jack Kowalski.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.822" offset="7239262">Then he goes on about Marshall.</text>

            <text syncTime="1839.361" offset="7357440">And thus we have the defendant's version that this purchase was suggested to him by the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1886.134" offset="7544477">So it was -- it did go to the jury on that question of entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.824" offset="7563285">And that's, what we say now the issue of willingness I think has been covered in my general discussion here that was our second point and we say that readiness and willingness isn't enough because it goes to the mental process of the man at the time of the initial discussion and that as the Sorrell's case points out, he is not entrapped unless he is an innocent person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.759" offset="7702988">That is one of the natures of entrapment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2060.286" offset="8241110">I would like to comment just a minute on this question of burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.857" offset="8263367">It's quite true as Mr. Knapp said that Sorrell's case doesn't discuss it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.070" offset="8284264">The rule which the Second Circuit has announced and followed in this case and which I submit is the correct rule, is that once the defendant proves inducement by the government, the government then has the burden of meeting the Sorrell standard, that is the government then has the burden and at the same degree of proof that the government must satisfy in any criminal case, the burden of showing that the defendant was not a person otherwise innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.182" offset="8428669">In the opinion below here, majority opinion, at Page 115 of the transcript, the majority says we think it plain that this is a case in which both the sale and the conspiracy were induced by Marshall, a government agent and that being so, the burden was on the government by way of reply to the defensive entrapment to prove a sufficient excuse for the entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.807" offset="8547161">Now in proving that sufficient excuse I submit that it is not enough to show as Mr. Knapp has urged the mental process of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.430" offset="8613616">I think that is a very slim and insubstantial standard by which to judge guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.472" offset="8649874">A man maybe easily persuaded, he may as Mr. Knapp pointed out in the record here need money.</text>

            <text syncTime="2888.999" offset="11555944">And I think the very uncertainty which fills the record on the subject of how they met, what they talked about, what the defendant said, Kowel said, that very uncertainty creates the hole in the Government's case that I have mentioned before.</text>
