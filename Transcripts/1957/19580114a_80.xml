            <text syncTime="32.213" offset="128836">The basic question here is whether the Army can give a soldier a less than honorable discharge certificate, when the actual character of that soldiers service, require that the Army give him nothing less than an honorable discharge.</text>

            <text syncTime="228.137" offset="912509">He replied with respect to himself and he said that he was not then and he had never been a member of the Communist Party but he refused categorically to answer any questions with respect to either his father or his stepmother.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.067" offset="996206">I should like to point out that all of the letter of allegations, all of the allegations contained in the letter, relate solely to legal activities which this young man carried on as a civilian prior to the time he was inducted into the Army with two exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.204" offset="1068722">He continued his association with both his father and his stepmother.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.252" offset="1088993">And several weeks after he'd been inducted, he did write a letter to two civilian friends, in which he asked that they make a contribution to the legal defense of two persons who'd been indicted under the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.153" offset="1152522">Now, on the 2nd of June, 1954, without any notice or hearing or whatever other than this letter of allegations received on February 9th.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.431" offset="1201633">Former Private Harmon was escorted off the Military post at Camp Pickett, Virginia with an undesirable discharge certificate in his pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.759" offset="1238936">And despite the fact that the entire 19 months, this young was in the Army, the only known ratings on his service record were excellent, both as to character and fitness.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.327" offset="1301211">Six days after his undesirable discharge, Harmon applied to the Army Discharge Review Board for a change to the discharge certificate from undesirable to honorable and he appeared before that Board and testified that he'd never been a member of the Communist Party or any subversive organization and he was completely (Inaudible) loyal to the Government of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.671" offset="1410612">And further than that, he wouldn't hesitate to lay down his life and defense of his country against any or all of its enemies whomsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.831" offset="1447288">He stated this under oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.426" offset="1457633">On the 15th of November, the same year, his appeal was denied and then he immediately appealed to the Board for the Correction of Military Records.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.854" offset="1503399">But they wouldn't even hear him and that appeal was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.415" offset="1517610">And then he finally appealed to the Secretary of the Army himself and he waited.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.700" offset="1542792">He waited until May 2nd, 1955, and then he commenced the action which resulted in -- are being here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.365" offset="1577378">He brought litigation in the District Court for the District Columbia, in which he prayed for a declaratory judgment, which would invalidate the receipt of the undesirable discharge and he also asked for a leave which would change the character of the discharge certificate from undesirable to honorable.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.810" offset="1671210">Now, after the complaint was filed in the District Court, counsel was informed that the Army Board for the Correction of Military Records, which wouldn't even hear the case before, had been ordered to make a fresh evaluation of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.053" offset="1740173">Now, we replied that we would rely on the evidence, which had already been furnished through testimony before the Army Discharge Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.912" offset="1787611">And which had already been placed, the complete file of transcript and record into the hands of the Board for the correction of military records since we have no additional evidence to present and on the basis of the plan and transcript before the Discharge Review Board, the Board for the Correction of Military Records once again refused to change the character of the discharge certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.833" offset="1895236">Now, in the District Court, on cross-motions for summary judgment, judgment was granted in the Army's favor, the sole ground being that the District Court lack jurisdiction to review the issuance of the undesirable discharge certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.085" offset="1964304">But before argument was had in the Court of Appeals, petitioner was notified that his undesirable discharge certificate had been up rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.959" offset="2015817">He wasn't given an honorable discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.400" offset="2029505">He was given something in between that, something which is universally regarded by everyone as “substandard”, a general under “honorable” conditions discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.423" offset="2081646">And at the same time, the respondent filed a motion in the Court of Appeals suggesting mootness, but the application was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.817" offset="2131174">However, on the 31st of January of last year, 1957, the court below affirmed the decision of the District Court, Judge Bazelon dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.045" offset="2184150">Your Honors, we think the basic issue in this case as Judge Bazelon points out very clearly in his dissent alone, is whether Section 4 (b) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act pursuant to which directive 5210.9, and that's the Department of Defense directive under which Harmon was given his original undesirable discharge, authorizes the issuance of less than honorable discharge certificate in the circumstances of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.435" offset="2345691">Now, we really think that that's the only issue before this Court and while respondents brief includes it in its counter statement of questions presented, his entire brief is spent in an attempt to avoid answering that question.</text>

            <text syncTime="610.330" offset="2441300">We say that that is really the key issue here because if this particular direct in the sense that we claim that it was invalid -- invalidly authorized and void, was validly authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.125" offset="2528444">Then of course, his position has a great deal more merit but if it was not validly authorized, if in fact it was actually in excess of the authority granted to the Secretary of Defense under Section 4 (b), then we say that the entire case that the respondent has made out false.</text>
