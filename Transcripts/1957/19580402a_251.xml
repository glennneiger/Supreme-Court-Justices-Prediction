            <text syncTime="21.432" offset="85682">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.893" offset="115566">This action involves the question of the fixing of tolls on the Panama Canal, a property of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.401" offset="157571">The broad issue involved is whether or not the ultimate control on the fixing of the tolls for the Canal shall be with the petitioner and finally the president, as provided by the statute, or if the Comptroller General as in this case developed should find that certain procedures of accounting that are followed by the petitioner are not satisfactory to him and persons who are financially interested can appeal to the courts to compel the petitioner to adopt those accounting practices in arriving at the tolls.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.544" offset="342100">Over considerable period of years, in fact from the time the Canal was constructed up to 1950, the statute provided that the President was authorized to prescribe tolls from time to time for the Canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.973" offset="423811">This action was considered final.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.424" offset="433633">There was no procedure for judicial review and no one claimed that there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.576" offset="458292">Under this procedure up until 1950, the President set the tolls at various times.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.764" offset="487027">President Taft, President Roosevelt and the last instant was a attempt on the part of President Truman to increase the tolls from 90 cents, but they were fixed by President Roosevelt in 1937 to a dollar in 1948.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.817" offset="683259">And when he proposed to increase this additional 10 cents, there was a considerable protest on part of the shipping in -- industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.738" offset="718890">And the -- the statute provided the issue to give six months notice of any such proposed increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.602" offset="746371">So the Congress responded to that protest by the industry and suggested that the President -- excuse me -- review the question in the procedures and the operations of the Canal and come forth with recommendations as to any changes that he might desire or think proper, so for a period of about three years, the Congress considered whether there's number of hearings in which the railroads participated and the ship -- ship owners and the -- the army and the Bureau of the Budget.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.688" offset="886700">The Bureau of the Budget recommended that all of the activities of the Canal be consolidated in one corporation that the corporation being the Panama Railroad Company with the name be changed to Panama Canal Company and have the -- both the supporting business activities as well as the Canal operations themselves all handled by this one corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.380" offset="1417509">So that this new statute was developed where the recommendation of the Bureau of the Budget that the President should have greater assistance in trying to arrive what was a sound and fair rate or toll for the Canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.401" offset="1477590">They had to have more expert advice and it was provided that the petitioner should have in exactly the same language as the President formally have, the authority to provide tolls from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.993" offset="1539971">It's also expressly provided that those -- whatever the petitioner determined would be subject to review by the President and that his action would be final and conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.034" offset="1592111">And many statutes that provide with President's action or someone acting in administrative capacity should be final, but this was final and conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.261" offset="1628996">It also provided that the tolls, being in effect, should continue until such time, as the petitioner and the President determined that there should be a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.827" offset="1687301">There was a -- a considerable claim by the shipping industry that the -- there were large defense activities involved in the whole conduct of the Canal and its operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.390" offset="1757518">So in connection with this new formula that was developed at that time, the Congress provided certain provisions that therefore had been included in the tolls should be excluded to take care of this claim about defense activities and other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.976" offset="1839856">One of them was the conduct of government vessels in transit through the Canal and up to that time, those vessels were -- which had ran into very seizable amounts during the war and during the Korean incident and other periods and during a period approximately three years from 1951 to 1954 ran to $13 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.514" offset="1937972">Those tolls at the discretion of the President should be either charged or they should be treated as though they were charged and the ship owners who are commercial vessels accredited on the formula as though the Government was paid.</text>

            <text syncTime="668.140" offset="2672536">Then the Comptroller General under the corporation control act proceeded to audit the corporation and it came out in 1954 with an audit report which it made the Congress, in which it criticized the methods of the petitioner in allocating its various costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.604" offset="2770338">It criticized its methods in not -- of taking this half over the cost of the Canal Zone Government and charging it to the various business activities and also, its distribution of the General overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.292" offset="2833136">And it said, if that -- if there were hearings at that time, the Canal rates or the toll rates would have to be materially reduced, in fact some 26%.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.445" offset="2881724">Now, the effect of redistributing those costs was to throw the business activities in a serious deficit all the way through because they just didn't make that much money.</text>
