            <label>Mr. John Rogers Carroll</label>
            <text syncTime="21.472" offset="85786">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.683" offset="94668">The Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.217" offset="96862">This case arises on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.488" offset="113894">The issue involved is whether a school teacher, public school teacher, maybe dismissed from his job on the ground of the incompetency without a hearing on his competency simply because he refused to answer a question relating to past Communist affiliations.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.919" offset="191634">The question in this case, unlike others Your Honors have had, was not asked formally in the form of a note or before a congressional committee but informally by his administrative superior, the Superintendent of schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.184" offset="256731">The facts which gave rise to this situation are briefly these.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.752" offset="278988">Petitioner was appointed a public teacher in Philadelphia on February 17th, 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.913" offset="307618">For 23 years thereafter, he continued to teach school and was continually rated competent in accordance with the official rating system.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.658" offset="350563">In May -- pardon me -- June of 1952, he received the summons from his Superintendent, the District Superintendent Schools to appear at the Superintendent's office to discuss what the Superintendent described on his letter as a matter of importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.326" offset="421303">Mr. Beilan of course appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.310" offset="433215">Superintendent told Mr. Beilan at that time that he had certain information which bore upon Mr. Beilan's fitness to continue to be a teacher.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.543" offset="474070">Mr. Beilan invited him to tell what that information was and what he had on his mind.The Superintendent agreed to and did ask one question to wit.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.592" offset="514299">“Were you in 1944 press director of the professional section of the Communist Political Association?”</text>
            <text syncTime="137.907" offset="551602">Mr. Beilan asked leave to consult a counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.411" offset="561633">And as the Superintendent testified, that was entirely satisfactory to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.788" offset="583053">Mr. Beilan thereupon left and did consult counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.049" offset="596114">Nothing happened until about four months later in October.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.067" offset="616176">Specifically on the 14th of October, 1952, another similar letter was directed to Mr. Beilan by the Superintendent.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.321" offset="653270">He came again and then told the Superintendent that counsel had advised him that he could not legally be asked questions such as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.704" offset="694753">At that point the Superintendent said, “I don't want you to think this is a matter of idle curiosity on my part.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.914" offset="715651">This is a serious and important question of your fitness.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.184" offset="728712">And your persistent refusal may lead to your dismissal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="185.385" offset="741460">Mr. Beilan nevertheless refused to answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.459" offset="761835">He went back to school and he continued in his job teaching English at Simon Gratz High School, Philadelphia, and continued to be rated competent for 13 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.063" offset="808229">Superintendent permitted those efficiency ratings to be entered on his records.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.070" offset="832261">Your Honors, if you care to note, we'll see at page 74 of the record that we have inserted photostatic copies of those 23 years of efficient ratings.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.308" offset="885133">But, then came the Committee on Un-American Activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.486" offset="905927">November 16th of 1953, only 13 months after his last interview with the Superintendent, Mr. Beilan was summoned along with almost 30 other Philadelphia school teachers to public televised hearings in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.561" offset="974158">I'm sure that Your Honors are by now sufficiently familiar with the proceedings of that Committee particularly from the Watkins case, that it takes very little imagination to conjure up a picture of what happened in our District courtroom that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.743" offset="1030896">In fact, it was three days Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.588" offset="1046256">Quite naturally it was highly publicized in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.356" offset="1061407">The first witness in accordance with the Committee's custom was a friendly witness and Mrs. Dorothy Funn, I recall, who described in great detail her intimate connection with the Communist Party and in generous generality, the influence of communism on school children.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.769" offset="1127027">Of course Mrs. Funn was from New York, but this did not bother the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.188" offset="1148656">They needed this purpose to their investigation.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="291.167" offset="1164643">Did the Committee (Inaudible) about this case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="293.670" stopTime="412.361">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="293.670" offset="1174674">It is as part of the factual matrix Your Honor because it is part of my contention that had the Committee not come that 13-month period might have been indefinitely extended and would never have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.211" offset="1232771">This man might not have been dismissed but for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.827" offset="1247295">Now it is of course perfectly true that in this case the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania expressly refused to decide whether the refusal to answer before the Committee could be independently a ground for dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.585" offset="1302256">That arose in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.268" offset="1309048">We had argued the case before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania while the Slochower case was pending in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.015" offset="1332036">Subsequently, Your Honors decided the Slochower case.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.440" offset="1345724">Then the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania on its own motion ordered reargument on the constitutional questions and its order specifically so stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.734" offset="1378847">At the Slochower, realizing that Your Honors had held in Slochower that a plea of the Fifth Amendment before a Committee was insufficient for firing.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.778" offset="1411030">The Supreme Court didn't decide that that was insufficient but expressly says in its opinion, “We decline to decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.532" offset="1438093">We find it unnecessary to decide it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="364.133" offset="1456483">But factually, that is what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.118" offset="1472470">Petitioner appeared before the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.396" offset="1481561">He was questioned about the same type of affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.620" offset="1494413">I might say that the latest affiliation mentioned in any of the questions put to him was 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.580" offset="1522312">This now, mind you, is 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.291" offset="1541120">In any event, he pleaded the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.132" offset="1548434">He did on the other hand submit a statement to the Committee in which he said that he had never illegally advocated overthrow of the Government and he also said that he was perfectly willing to talk about himself if the Committee would agree not to ask him about other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.584" offset="1618233">And Congressman Walter who was Chairman of that particular subcommittee had declined that offer so we don't make deals with witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1355.768" offset="5423020">Instead they chose to charge simply the refusal to answer as incompetency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.949" offset="5443709">Now, what's the evidence in this record?</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.548" offset="5454158">I've already invited Your Honors' attention to petitioner's Exhibit 1 at page 74, which shows 23 consecutive years of competent ratings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.991" offset="5507866">In addition, Your Honors will note that the last rating is made 10 days after he was publicly suspended by the Superintendent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.929" offset="5543706">I've also printed in the appendix to the brief the section of the Pennsylvania School Law which requires that in competency cases, the issue is to be decided on the basis of the official rating cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.677" offset="5602638">They just made up the rating card in which they said refusal to answer is incompetency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.609" offset="5626358">In addition to that I suggest that the fact unlike Konigsberg where Your Honor Mr. Justice Harlan made some point of the rule that the applicant for the bar had the burden of proving his good moral qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.063" offset="5688216">Here, on the other hand, we had an incumbent teacher with tenure and one of the important incidents of that tenure is that in any charge against him, the burden of proof is on the Board of Education to show by preponderance in the evidence that he did commit the act which makes it different.</text>

            <text syncTime="2439.614" offset="9758407">The issue it seems to me in this case is threefold and it is brief whether in the first instance, State of Pennsylvania has the constitutional right to dismiss a public school teacher for refusal to answer pertinent questions in an area relating to past communist affiliations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.295" offset="9877107">Second, whether the interpretation by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, that such a refusal to answer in point of fact constitutes incompetency under the School Code of Pennsylvania is in fact an interpretation of a state statute and does not involve constitutional questions, and thirdly wether in the circumstances of this case, there was in any degree an absence of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.519" offset="10029976">Now our position, submission to Your Honors is from start to finish that the issue here was, one, primarily of local law that in the first instance the pertinency of the questions that were asked of the school teacher and for the moment I'm not going to debate very much the issues of fact which have been discussed by my friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.362" offset="10129345">But the question whether the inquiry which was initiated in a professional interview by the superintendent of schools in Philadelphia was a proper inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.928" offset="10179709">In other words here in 1952, he brings in a school teacher for a professional interview and he asks him certain questions regarding prior communist affiliations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.258" offset="10252957">The school teacher says in substance, “I don't know whether I'll answer those questions but you read them to me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.325" offset="10281273">And the first question that was read and others of course were to be propounded was whether in 1944 he had been Press Director of a Communist Political Association to which he answered as Mr. Carroll said, “I'll have to seek advise of counsel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.201" offset="10348774">Later on, seven months later in October, he came again, in the same spur of the professional interview and said, “I have been advised by counsel that you have no right to ask that question.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.234" offset="10400914">This is important if Your Honors please, bearing on the one question asked that question or any similar question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.594" offset="10434351">Consequently, the Superintendent stopped at the threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.173" offset="10452637">And in that moment, he specifically warned that teacher Beilan that he was inquiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.232" offset="10484924">The reason for his inquiry was the professional fitness, i.e. the adequacy, the competency of this particular person and that is adhered the Superintendent was the reason I'm asking these questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="4490.257" offset="17960960">In the Davis case, the school teacher who was a professor in the University of Kansas City was called before the general committee, he pled the Fifth Amendment and thereafter the authorities of the school -- of the university, first an educational committee similar to the one that Mr. Justice Frankfurter was suggesting and later on the Board of Trustees of the university asked Mr. Davis to come in before them and they propounded three certain questions that are referred to in the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4526.649" offset="18106514">They all had to do with membership in the Communist Party, membership in Communist activities or support of Communist organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4535.895" offset="18143504">He refused to answer his immediate superiors and later on was discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4543.187" offset="18172656">There was tenure in that case by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4545.872" offset="18183419">He was later on discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4547.835" offset="18191256">And when the matter came up before the Court on a petition for reinstatement, the question was squarely presented and the Court in that case said and I would just like to quote briefly that the public will not stand and they ought not to stand for such reticence or refusals to answer by the teachers in their schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.469" offset="18313822">And the university officials would have been derelict in their duties had they not asked the plaintiff in the light of his refusal to answer the Senate Subcommittee's questions as to whether he was a Communist, whether he was or ever had been a member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4596.253" offset="18384980">And having asked him those questions that he have been refused to answer them would have been derelict in their duties and would have destroyed the university had they not dismissed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.069" offset="18428238">Now, the significance of that case to me if Your Honors please is that in view of the language of this Court in Slochower where Garner was still referred to when Your Honors said it doesn't follow that in a proper inquiry, Dr. Slochower may not prove himself to be not in the proper service of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4636.535" offset="18546103">Now here, what happened was that the man was brought back before a proper committee, an informal committee of this university and there it was held that they have the right to ask the questions and that it was his duty to answer and his failure to answer would justify the dismissal.</text>

            <label>Mr. John Rogers Carroll</label>
            <text syncTime="5608.744" offset="22434900">I think sir, that your case presents perhaps a little more evidence of pertinency to a legitimate governmental interest than this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5620.120" offset="22480457">But in any event, I should add that this record shows, I specifically asked Dr. Hoyer if he had any complaints about things like that, his answer was no.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.941" offset="22523716">Now, the Chief Justice's questions and those of Mr. Justice -- Justice Brennan, I think have indicated that the definition of incompetency which the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has adopted in this case is just so broad as to encompass almost the whole world but whatever it does, the distinction in Mr. Rhoads answer between the Communist Party and the Republican Party indicates that in considering refusals to answer, the Board makes the intermediate inference through loyalty in order to arrive at incompetency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5667.245" offset="22668957">I think that that is inescapable in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and in Mr. Rhoads' answers to Your Honors' questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.413" offset="22701558">Now, on the procedural due process question, I have previously argued that because the interest wasn't loyalty, he was entitled to a hearing on loyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5688.254" offset="22752967">I go one step further that whatever the interest was, this teacher having been fired for refusing to answer questions about loyalty was thereby branded with what Mr. Justice Frankfurter has called a stigma of disloyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5705.820" offset="22823184">I think that the firing under a stigma of disloyalty is as clear here as it was in the Wieman case where he was fired for refusing to answer and in Slochower.</text>
            <text syncTime="5718.541" offset="22874070">That I say, requires a hearing on loyalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.200" offset="22888699">Thanks very kindly Your Honor.</text>
