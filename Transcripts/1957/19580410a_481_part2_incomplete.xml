            <text syncTime="173.948" offset="695693">And then, in paragraph numbered 4, it goes on in regard to the proclamation and makes a part of the proclamation, all of the regulations of the Secretary in regard to the issues of passports in accordance with this statute and the proclamations.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.310" offset="829231">Then, on page 109, we have the provisions in regard to the granting of the passports, the statute that empowers the Secretary to grant or deny passports and it incorporates in the first paragraph there at six -- Section 211(a) under such rules as the President shall designate and prescribe for and on behalf of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.070" offset="964232">And in 213, it provides for an application for passport.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.306" offset="997146">It requires that they submit a written application, duly verified by its oath before a person authorizes them the power to administer oaths.</text>

            <text syncTime="297.019" offset="1188049">And then, Section 51.77 authorizes the Secretary of State to make the passport regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.988" offset="1395879">And 51.135 is the one of particular interest in this case and subparagraphs A, B and C.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.676" offset="1506638">Then, turning to page 115, Section 51.142 is the Secretary as distinguished from the President's giving it authority to the Secretary to provide for applications, affidavit and oath, the Secretary's requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.800" offset="1591171">Then, before their affirmation by applicants be given as to membership in the Communist Party, at any stage of the proceedings in the Passport Division and before the Board, if it was deemed necessary, the applicant maybe required as a part of his application to subscribe under oath or affirmation to a statement with respect to present or past membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.792" offset="1691167">If applicant states that he is Communist, refusal of the passport in this case will be -- be without further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.957" offset="1723768">Now, that's the -- taking that frame through those various statutes and the proclamations and the regulations, the Government's position that the proclamations and regulations were provided for and authorized by law.</text>

            <text syncTime="591.577" offset="2366276">Now, the issue in this case is whether or not the termination of these proceedings or failure to furnish the affidavit is proper, lawful and whether not if the petitioners have lost rights that they are entitled to under the Constitution and law and is the cause of that and so it depends upon whether or not the Secretary having the power to require such an affidavit and in general terms at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.920" offset="2507651">We believe that the statutes and regulations, proclamations that I referred to, do authorize the requirement of an application, that the application is necessary for the Secretary to get the facts from which he can be able to issue or deny the passport and also that the requirement under the oath is reasonable, it's expressly provided for by not only the -- the regulations of the Secretary, but also the proclamation of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.811" offset="2691239">And going back into the history of these four matters, which largely developed in the war period of 1914 and later years the Congress addressed itself to this question of travel control because it found and there's a considerable history of the -- in the hearings about it that passports were being used by citizens of the United States to further the war efforts and the various espionage and subversive activities of Germany during World War I and prior thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.185" offset="2856647">And it is because of that investigations have found that it's very expensive, both in this hemisphere and in Europe of this activity that's going on that the Congress authorized this authority to restrict this travel control and prevent or prohibit where the Secretary was able to find it, the conduct of American citizens in that way in aiding the war effort of -- of foreign power.</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.560" offset="9070237">Therefore, if Congress wanted to prevent, wanted to implement the Act of 1950, this was the way in which it could be done.</text>
