            <text syncTime="31.682" offset="126642">One thing that I would like to correct in my argument of yesterday, I -- my memory played me false and I made a -- an inaccurate statement of facts in response to your question, Mr. Justice Brennan, as to whether or not there was currently a contract between the parties, there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.265" offset="205009">At the expiration of the contract negotiated which gave rise to this controversy and another three-year contract was entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.166" offset="240640">It is still in effect, still being administered and has not quite two years yet to run.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="66.273" offset="265091">So, that is the signatory for the union there and also the local?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_davis" startTime="69.999" stopTime="154.180">
            <label>Mr. James Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="69.999" offset="279928">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.725" offset="282854">The signatory there was the International.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.899" offset="291527">That contract was entered into during the period when certiorari was pending and there was outstanding the order of the Court of Appeals enforcing the contract so that the company made no question about that and the contract was -- that contract was signed by the name of the International.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.826" offset="383269">Now, I'm not entirely satisfied that I fully answered the questions which the Chief Justice directed to me last evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.075" offset="428199">Because of the shortage of time, I was trying to truncate the answer and I'm not sure that the question can be answered as summarily as I attempted to do because the question in its full implication goes to the heart of the whole case and I -- I don't believe that it can be answered summarily without a little further explanation.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.641" offset="534465">And I would like with the permission of the Court to address myself to that question now, which as I recall was in essence.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.449" offset="569783">“Mr. Davis, aren't you departing from the certification of the Board and if you are, by what right do you claim to act in -- in essence?”</text>
            <text syncTime="152.110" offset="608340">I think that was what you asked me, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="154.180" stopTime="154.848">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="154.180" offset="616699">That's right.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_davis" startTime="154.848" stopTime="517.418">
            <label>Mr. James Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="154.848" offset="619311">And of course, that goes to one of the fundamental issues in the case and I think requires a little further analysis than I was able to make last night.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.983" offset="667899">Now, in the first place as I view the statute, there is no magic in certification other than to identify the representative through whom bargaining is to be carried on.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.954" offset="755775">The Board itself as we have indicated in our brief has held that the function of the certification is only to name, i.e. identify the bargaining representative and has no purpose to either delimit or delineate the bargaining agents' functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.069" offset="852219">Therefore, once the certification has been made as I view it, the parties are in no different posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.471" offset="885864">Then, it would be the case where the bargaining agent to present itself to the employer and be recognized voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.035" offset="932049">The -- the certification does nothing but identify the bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.929" offset="955664">Now then, to go further and this is where it gets to what I conceive to be the heart of the case and what I meant yesterday in part when I said to date, I think both Board and lower courts have attempted to reach this case from the top or these -- these cases from the top down and instead of starting at the bottom and laying the statute there and -- and working the thing up.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.752" offset="1054929">Now, there is -- it seems to me a clear distinction between the statutory requirements for bargaining and contracting or be it that I fully recognize that the execution of a contract, evidence in an agreement reached is mandatory under the statute, under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.661" offset="1178540">But we're charged here with a failure to bargain in violation of 885.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.490" offset="1205917">Now, bargaining as prescribed in the Act says nothing about recognition or status or any other words of that import.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.423" offset="1277597">What the statute says is that the bargaining agent having been identified by certification or otherwise that then we are compelled to meet and confer, that is every employer is compelled, to meet and confer in good faith with that bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.509" offset="1381982">To the end, that agreement may be reached, but there is no compulsion to contract until agreement is reached and then only as evidenced of such agreement as is reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.529" offset="1462021">There is no statutory mandate that the contract shall be in the name of the bargaining agent or in the name of any branch or part of the bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.296" offset="1525133">The statute simply says that we shall meet and confer with the bargaining agent and with no other, which we did admittedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.454" offset="1565780">There is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.305" offset="1573198">Now, it is perfectly clear and I think without dispute and certainly evidenced in our brief that the question of how the bargaining agent is to be identified in a contract is a usual and frequent subject of bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.526" offset="1658044">Now, if -- if identifying the bargaining agent in a name other than the certificate or in a name other than the card which is presented to the receptionist when the union comes in for voluntary recognition, derogates the union status.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.673" offset="1742681">The union is no more free so to derogate its status than are we, because the statute imposes a reciprocal obligation as I read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.380" offset="1793463">We are compelled to recognize exclusively the representative status, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.381" offset="1825437">We are to bargain with no other.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.379" offset="1837453">But the union is equally under a mandate to bargain with us, as the exclusive representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.647" offset="1882488">And it seems to me that we are no more entitled, that the union is no more entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.068" offset="1912268">It has -- it has gone to the electorate.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.215" offset="1920836">It has sought a charter of representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.037" offset="1940062">And if there is magic in the particular name, the union owes the same obligation to the people, not to derogate from the representation authority which had -- with which it has been impressed with as we all not to attempt to dilute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.924" offset="2015608">Now, it seems to me therefore that this question of the name in which a union is to be identified is not a question of recognition at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.456" offset="2201809">My point is that so far as recognition is concern, the word is not used in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.664" offset="2238589">The mandate of the statute is to meet and confer to the exclusion of any other and that we did and in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.165" offset="2280594">We are -- the three mandates in the statute, to meet and confer forum, to meet and confer to the -- with the union to the exclusion of others and in good faith and about terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.090" offset="2332317">We did meet and confer.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.701" offset="2338795">We met and conferred with every representative of the -- the union presented to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.490" offset="2357917">We never turned anybody away.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.059" offset="2364186">We met and conferred in good faith and I think in essence that this case really is only -- involves whether or not these two proposals were or were not terms or conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.546" offset="2414132">Now, if -- if they are two entities, as Your Honor suggests, then not only this employer and this union have misconceived the statute, but still have many, many other employers and many, many other unions.</text>

            <text syncTime="655.285" offset="2621127">I have tried to evidence it in the brief by a reference to BNA, CCH, other recognized bargaining tools to show that the subject of how a union is to be identified is a common subject of bargaining and is recognized by both employers and unions as a proper subject to bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.883" offset="2731468">Now, in the -- not only is that a general industrial practice, but as I attempted to call to the Court's yesterday, it is a fixed practice with this union and even more sharply between this union and this employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.266" offset="2801058">Because in the Wooster Division, the union there bargained right up to a strike for expansion of the representative from the certified local to a recognition of the local and the international.</text>

            <text syncTime="763.346" offset="3053296">Now, so far as administration of the contract is concerned, and these are all the same type subjects, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1305.091" offset="5220310">Now, by this -- it was all in my brief, my basic objection to the Board position herein that they have applied a mechanical per se artificial test to determine the activity of the parties and to limit the bargaining area and that the statute does no such thing that the purpose and intent of the statute is to leave the parties free, to explore, to expand, if possible their areas of agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.069" offset="5344235">And so long as they are in good faith and the subjects with which they are discussing are either terms and conditions of employment or relate thereto or are so closely connected as to be reasonably deemed to affect terms and conditions of employment and the very fact that they talk about them is certainly strong evidence that they do or that they strike about them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1597.427" offset="6389656">I should like briefly to comment on two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.657" offset="6406583">Mr. Davis has indicated this union has bargained and accepted the strike clause such as we have in this contrary, as we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.779" offset="6443050">He mentioned particularly the Allis-Chalmers contract that this union has with our company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.052" offset="6464157">I think that in passing, I should mention that the union filed charges against the company in that case in -- on the basis of the company's insistence upon that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.581" offset="6506266">That matter was litigated to the Board, to the -- and to the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.891" offset="6523507">And of course, the Seventh Circuit ruled against us as -- as the Court may know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.828" offset="6547226">Now, coming back to the question of Mr. Justice Frankfurter has put insofar as I've been able to discover, if there is any bargaining with respect to who is to be the party named on the contract the bargain has been whether someone in addition to the certified representative should be named.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.335" offset="6621309">For example, if the local has this certificate, whether the International should also be named or the International has a certificate whether the local should also be named.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.158" offset="6660598">Now, in this connection, I should like to read what the Bureau of National Fares in a study made in 1956, we haven't cited this in our brief, but I will supply it to the clerk for the Court's convenience if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.478" offset="6721829">And if I may read just one short paragraph, it said in reports that under the Taft Act, the business of writing recognition and related clauses has become largely routine for too many reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.083" offset="6776268">First, the union representing a majority of the employers in the appropriate bargaining union must be recognized as the exclusive bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.822" offset="6803226">And second, coverage of the contract is fixed to a large degree by the Labor of Board determination of the appropriate bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.637" offset="6834469">Now, it seems to me that if these matters become largely routine that it's not quite accurate to say that these become subject to collective bargaining as to whether or not --</text>
