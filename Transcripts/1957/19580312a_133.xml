            <text syncTime="28.182" offset="112640">The petitioner, Parris Sinkler, was the cook on the private car assigned to the general manager of the respondent, railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.526" offset="150047">That car came into the Union Station in Houston on March 30th, 1949 at the end of one of the respondent's trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.228" offset="184842">After it arrived in the station while the petitioner was still aboard the car performing the duties of his employment, the car was switched from one track to another within the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.252" offset="232908">In the course of that switching movement, and because of the negligence of the crew handling the car, the petitioner was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.020" offset="276062">Now, the crew handling the car as the record shows, were employees of Houston Belt and Terminal Railway Company, which is a corporation, separate from respondent although affiliated within a number of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.851" offset="327367">Respondent owned 50% of its stock and appointed in effect four of its eight directors, that is 50% of them, and there were a number of common employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="99.937" offset="399673">I do, Your Honor, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.566" offset="418168">There were a number of affiliations between respondent and Houston Belt and Terminal which we will go into in more detail later.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.773" offset="459024">Now, petitioner continued to work after his accident being off for some months about a year after it in order to have an operation to repair some of the effects of it, but he went back to work and continued to work on his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.716" offset="526838">He did not consult counsel until more than two years after the accident, and he then discovered that any action by him against Houston Belt and Terminal Railway Company, which would have of course to be a common law action in the State Courts of Texas, was barred by the Texas two-year statute of limitations.But his action against his employer under the three-year limitation statute applicable to the Employers' Liability Act was still open to him since less than three years had passed.He, therefore, filed this suit less than three years after the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.222" offset="672810">Now, the respondent's only defense which is now material is that Houston Belt and Terminal's employees were the negligent ones, that Houston Belt and Terminal Railway Company was, as to the Respondent, an independent contractor, and that therefore, respondent was not liable for the negligence of the switching crew and not liable for petitioner's injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.008" offset="787958">Petitioner obtained a judgment in the District Court of Harris County, Texas, upon a jury verdict which among other things found expressly upon special issues submitted under the Texas practice that Houston Belt and Terminal was respondent's agent and was not an independent contractor in performing the movement in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.090" offset="868310">That judgment was reversed by the Court of Civil Appeals at Beaumont on appeal and judgment was there rendered that petitioner take nothing against the respondent.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.456" offset="1025776">That is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.500" offset="1037897">Now, the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals insofar as I can understand it, appears to say that as a matter of law, the Belt here was an independent contractor and that respondent was therefore not liable for the negligence of the switching crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.295" offset="1117100">Our position here is three-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.911" offset="1127549">We say first that respondent is liable to petitioner for injuries caused to him while he was in the course of his employment by the persons who are performing respondent's switching regardless of the precise legal relationship between them, regardless of whether or not by the usual rules they might be deemed independent contractors rather than agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.359" offset="1241339">We say further that there is no contract in evidence in this case which makes the Belt an independent contractor while performing switching for respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.081" offset="1292225">But if there were such contract, it would not affect the petitioner's rights because it would fall within the prohibition of Section 5 of the Employers' Liability Act expressly providing that any contract or device whatsoever which will enable a common carrier to avoid its liability under the Act is to that extent void.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.973" offset="1399850">And we say, finally, that the question of whether Belt in performing this movement was an agent or an independent contractor was resolved against the respondent by the jury's verdict, that there was evidence to support that verdict, and that the Court of Civil Appeals had no jurisdiction to reverse the judgment based on that verdict, whether or not it agreed with the jury about the facts found.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.102" offset="1504340">Now, the first main ground on which we rely, and the one I think that is really most important for the disposition of this case is simply that the respondent is liable to petitioner for injuries suffered by the petitioner in the course of his employment when those injuries are due to the negligence of persons performing the respondent's switching.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.978" offset="1607889">Now, we say that that has always been the case both under the Employers' Liability Act and that common law before the passage of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.488" offset="1657940">The case precisely in point, of considerable antiquity, which is cited and discussed at length in our brief --</text>

            <text syncTime="439.782" offset="1759086">My point is this, that when the respondent, the Missouri Pacific, entrust the performance of its switching to the crew, the Houston Belt and Terminal, and the negligence of that crew injures petitioner while he is working as an employee of the Missouri Pacific, then the Missouri Pacific is liable to him for that negligence regardless of whether or not from other standpoints, the crew of the Belt might be considered agents or independent contractor --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="477.135" offset="1908506">Is that on the ground of non-delegability?</text>

            <text syncTime="478.081" offset="1912268">Non-delegability, precisely, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.596" offset="1922299">Now, in the case I referred to a moment ago, Floody versus Great Northern Railway and others from the Supreme Court of Minnesota, which was a case decided prior to the Employers' Liability Act and which does not relate to federal law but simply to the common law on the subject, the facts were almost precisely the same as they are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.259" offset="2000980">In that case, Floody, the plaintiff, was employed by the Omaha Railway, and while he was taking one of its engines out of the Union Depot in St. Paul, the engine was wrecked and he was injured because of the negligence of a crew throwing a switch that the engine had to pass over.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.710" offset="2106828">Now, his employer there raised the same defense that respondent raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.407" offset="2121561">It said the Union Depot Company is a separate corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.259" offset="2132950">We have nothing to do with that, we have a merely contractual relationship with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.606" offset="2150400">The crew which threw this switch improperly consisted of employees of the Union Depot Company paid by it, given instructions by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.854" offset="2183314">We have no control over them, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.120" offset="2192405">Therefore, we are not responsible to Floody for the negligence of that crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.459" offset="2209750">But the Supreme Court of Minnesota said it does not matter to the Plaintiff here whether or not the crew, which threw the switch, and which caused his injuries were employees of his employer or employees of Union Depot Company, a separate corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.342" offset="2293342">His employer is liable to him for their negligence because the employer chose to make use of their services upon that occasion in order to get his train out of the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.673" offset="2342661">And we say the situation is precisely the same here.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.803" offset="2359171">The Missouri Pacific chose to avail itself of the services of Houston Belt and Terminal switching crews at Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.737" offset="2386860">The record shows that it employed no switching crews of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.156" offset="2400549">It had all of its switching in the Union station done by Houston Belt and Terminal crews.</text>

            <text syncTime="611.233" offset="2444852">Now of course there are -- there are other questions that could be involved which we don't go into.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.131" offset="2464496">But as respects to this plaintiff, his employer is liable to him for injuries caused in the course of his employment by the negligence of the persons doing his employer's switching, regardless of what precise arrangements his employer may have made to have that switching done.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.589" offset="2530325">And we say that this case is simply on all force with the Floody case, that it cannot be distinguished and I don't think that respondent has actually attempted to distinguish it.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.269" offset="2568986">Respondent's whole argument, as I understand it on this point, is briefly this, that in several cases, this Court has held that in order to be entitled to the protection of the Act, in order to be entitled to sue under it, a plaintiff must be an employee of a common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.808" offset="2663131">That term is understood in a conventional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.770" offset="2675043">For instance, in Robinson versus the B&amp;O, a Pullman porter could not sue the B&amp;O for his injuries because he was not the railroad's employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.865" offset="2723422">He was the employee for the Pullman Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.348" offset="2733349">And there have been several other cases to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.081" offset="2748291">Respondent here attempts to say that to draw the inference from those cases that since the employees of the Belt may not have been employees of respondent, so as to be entitled to sue respondent, if they should be injured, that the respondent is not liable for their negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.951" offset="2843794">In other words, they are not only not employees but they are not servants or agents of any description.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.486" offset="2869917">Now, we think that the inference attempted to be drawn is obviously faulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.456" offset="2889770">There is no question here that the petitioner is respondent's employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.821" offset="2907220">He is entitled to the protection of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.725" offset="2914847">He is entitled to sue under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.190" offset="2924669">So that at all those cases which go off on the fact that the plaintiff is not an employee of the defendant and is therefore not entitled to the protection of the Act have nothing to do with this situation in which the petitioner is the employee of the respondent and is entitled to the protection of the Act and entitled to sue under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.568" offset="3010247">We say that the Floody case and the principles it lays down rather than Robinson versus B&amp;O are governing.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.710" offset="3034802">Now, it is interesting to note that in Robinson versus B&amp;O, the Court saw as a matter of dicta this -- this point which I'm making here, because in the opinion of that case, after holding that the Pullman porter was not an employee and was not entitled to sue under the Act, it went on to say it would be absurd that the question is not whether the railroad company by virtue of its duty to passengers of which it cannot divest itself by any arrangement with the sleeping car company would not be liable for the negligence of a sleeping car porter in matters involving the passenger's safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.029" offset="3196029">In other words, the sleeping car porter could not sue the railroad as its employee under the Act, but nevertheless, the railroad might be liable to third parties for his negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.830" offset="3247229">He would be an agent for whose acts -- for whose negligent acts the railroad company could be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.704" offset="3278785">Now, another case which we think is fair -- in point on the facts, although it does not involve a railroad employee, is Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway Company versus Shelton from the Supreme Court of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.996" offset="3327896">That too is a case of some antiquity and was decided by a court composed of Justices Burt, Gaines, Brown and Williams, which I think Justice Clark will agree with me, is generally recognized as having been one of the ablest Supreme Courts ever to sit in Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="873.765" offset="3494975">I think that the term was necessarily viewed in extremely relative sense of course.</text>

            <text syncTime="884.731" offset="3538860">There, the plaintiff was a passenger on a train of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.817" offset="3563207">He was injured in the yards of Purcell, Oklahoma by the negligence of a switching crew composed of employees of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.713" offset="3606779">That crew at that point, performed as a switching crew for both railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.014" offset="3627990">And the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe simply paid the Atchison Company a portion of the expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.062" offset="3652232">Now in that case, the trial court -- the District Court had instructed the jury as a matter of law that since the switching crew employed by the Atchison Company performed the work of a switching crew for the Gulf Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.167" offset="3708656">The Gulf was liable for their negligence, if any, which might have injured the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.752" offset="3734988">The judgment for the plaintiff was affirmed by the Court of Civil Appeals and was again affirmed by the Supreme Court of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.784" offset="3767066">The court held, as I construe the opinion that quite consistently with the Floody case, the fact that the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe had availed itself of the services of that switching crew, made that switching crew as far as the plaintiff was concerned, the servants or agents of the Gulf Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.408" offset="3849613">So, the Gulf Company was liable for their negligence in spite of the fact that it was conceded that the Atchison Company had selected and paid these men, that they were on its payroll, and that all Gulf did was to contribute a portion of the expense of running the yard at Purcell.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.487" offset="3925891">Now, we say that there is absolutely nothing in any later case, there is nothing in the Employers' Liability Act, there is nothing in the law that we have been able to find which would commit, permit or compel the conclusion that the respondent in this case can escape liability simply because it may have made a contract with another company for the performance of switching service.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.153" offset="4276558">That is A.T.&amp; W.T. Railway Company versus Anderson, 120 Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.135" offset="4292441">That is a decision of the Supreme Court of Texas back about 25 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.209" offset="4320758">It held that when one railroad leased its line to another railroad under an arrangement approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission and covered by a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity from the Interstate Commerce Commission, then the lessor railroad was no longer responsible for the torts of the employees of the lessee railroad, here a passenger had been injured by a conductor and he sued the lessor railroad and the court held he couldn't recover against the lessor railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.560" offset="4450220">Now, respondent might have attempted to stretch that case in this Court to cover this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1870.597" offset="7482305">The only reason on the merit is in this Court is because this case was barred for the statute of limitation of two years in Texas if he had sued the company who is at fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.939" offset="7575719">This client knew that and I quote the language here to make a claim from the transcript of the testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="1951.475" offset="7863902">Question - “Since you couldn't sue the Houston Belt and Terminal Railroad Company direct, your lawyer told you that you would take a chance and see what you could do by suing your own company."</text>

            <text syncTime="1970.236" offset="7880934">There's not anything in the law of the statutes of any State or the statutes of the Federal Government which says that a railroad company cannot employ switching carriers.</text>
