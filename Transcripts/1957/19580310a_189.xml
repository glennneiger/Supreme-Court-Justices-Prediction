          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_g_denzer" startTime="33.209" stopTime="314.407">
            <label>Mr. Richard G. Denzer</label>
            <text syncTime="33.209" offset="132807">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.938" offset="143673">Before proceeding to any other aspect of this case, I'd like to touch upon two pages of it which in my opinion made considerable clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.986" offset="203860">One of those is the factual situation and the other is the rather peculiar nature of the petitioner's contention here.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.350" offset="241371">Now as to the facts, this was of course a New York County in New York State grand jury investigation into the question of whether certain labor union representatives had received criminal payments from certain businessmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.371" offset="317440">I say criminal, meaning, criminal either by way of extortion or a bribe receiving.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.343" offset="349309">The line between extortion and bribe receiving is sometimes rather thin and was not known precisely what the nature of these payments would be assuming they could be established by the interrogation in the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.376" offset="417437">It was pursuant to this investigation that this witness, this petitioner, was called and was asked whether he had made certain of such payments to two union -- labor union representatives named Goldberg and Goldstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.507" offset="482011">He refused to answer those questions on the privilege ground and that's why we're here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.251" offset="516911">Now, it should be pointed out that this petitioner is not a racketeer and not an underworld character.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.208" offset="548780">He's a businessman.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.333" offset="557244">He was not the target of this investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.527" offset="570096">He was not a prospective defendant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.549" offset="582113">He was purely a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.973" offset="595801">The grand jury's and the state prosecutor's purpose, of course, nevertheless to construct a criminal case or criminal charges against this person at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.447" offset="649718">That's pretty obviously so because, otherwise, we would not have called him as a witness and offered him complete immunity in our courts from all prosecution for or on account of anything which he might say there.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.170" offset="708650">I also want to stress that there is nothing whatever in this case to support the implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.053" offset="748147">In my -- one of the adversary's arguments on Thursday that this case was permeated with federal ramifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.982" offset="787853">There wasn't any federal flavor to this grand jury inquiry whatsoever and the word federal has been injected here only by virtue of the argument which has been made in this Court and some of the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.978" offset="847830">The way the investigation was described by my friend when gathered the impression that the Taft-Hartley law was always a factor here, and that you could almost see a plaque residing it on the grand jury room wall.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.747" offset="906971">And that the federal prosecutor whose office was graphically described as three blocks down the street, whatever difference that might make, was somehow lurking outside the grand jury room ready to pounce upon this witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.573" offset="974263">Well, that of course was not the situation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.864" offset="987429">There is no indication whatsoever in this case, no suggestion of any interest by the United States Attorney for the Southern District or any other federal agency of any interest in this petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.197" offset="1044689">And as a matter of fact, this is just a kind of case in which one would be least likely to find an interest by the United States Attorney or the local federal prosecutor of the District because as I've pointed out, this witness is not a target.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.548" offset="1134132">He is someone whom we hope to use against the targets, against the labor leaders whom -- whom might be described as prospective defendants and who were actually indicted on other charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.660" offset="1182616">And any cooperation, so to speak, by the federal prosecutor could certainly not take the form of leaping into the middle of our case and prosecuting one of our witnesses upon whom we were relying upon for evidence against the main targets.</text>

            <text syncTime="517.378" offset="2069420">One -- one other item on the facts, in his brief, the petitioner refers to something which he entitles an announced policy of cooperation between the United States Attorney for the Southern District and the District Attorney of New York County with respect to labor racketeering matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.203" offset="2156774">Apparently, he derives that from a newspaper article appearing sometime before this case in which Mr. Paul Williams, the United States Attorney, announced in very general fashion that he and Mr. Hogan, the District Attorney of New York County, were going to cooperate in the investigation of labor racketeering.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.639" offset="2246531">And from that, my friend jumped to the conclusion that there was a concrete policy here which encompassed this particular case and this particular witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.147" offset="2308493">Now, of course, that statements by Mr. Williams was so general that we contend that no specific coverage of this case can be predicated whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="1802.125" offset="7208438">But I say that it is extremely unlikely and it's one of those situations where route remoteness is the order of the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.296" offset="7253159">And again I say, if there is any -- if the practice to that effect, I think that it should, that the burden is on the petitioner to show it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.656" offset="7286596">But coming to the petitioner's argument in this case, I'd like to touch that for a moment because I think it's one of the most unusual arguments that has ever been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.867" offset="7339468">To show how really unusual it is, one has to examine the theme -- the legal theme of the decisions, the many decisions which have been handed down by this Court on this general subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.315" offset="7409162">Now, this is of course but one of many cases which have come before the Court where state legislation or state action has been attacked upon the ground that someone's privilege against self-incrimination was infringed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.752" offset="7470916">And for that reason, there was a violation of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.399" offset="7489515">Sometimes these claims are addressed to immunity statutes such as the one we're dealing with here where it's claimed that the immunity is insufficient -- insufficiently broad to compensate for the withdrawal of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.479" offset="7553881">Sometimes the claims are addressed to other kinds of statutes such as those which permit comment upon the defendant's failure to take the stand at a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.146" offset="7600483">But generally speaking, whenever this type of contention addressed to self-incrimination privilege arises, there's some discussion of the Fifth Amendment because that's the one that embodies the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.002" offset="7647922">But inevitably, the argument is relegated to due process in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.522" offset="7674044">And that is, of course, because the Fifth Amendment is not applicable to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.576" offset="7694211">In case after case of this sort, the argument and the issues have all boiled down and narrowed down the question of whether there was a violation of due process and a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.247" offset="7764950">Now with that in mind, I find that most surprising that there was not one word mentioned about the Fourteenth Amendment in my friend's argument here last Thursday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.662" offset="7822629">And in this setting, to able to argue with the contention of this type without a single solitary reference to the Fourteenth Amendment, is really an incredible feat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.170" offset="7868604">Now from this, you might gather that the argument was going to be that the Fifth Amendment was applicable to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.921" offset="7895667">And that Mr. Fitzpatrick was going to try to overturn the well settled rule from the time of Barron against Baltimore that it is not, but apparently that's not his argument either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.249" offset="7960973">In fact, when he was asked here on Thursday whether that was his position, he said that it was not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2045.315" offset="8181238">As nearly as I can spell it out, it runs something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.583" offset="8206315">That the Fifth Amendment and the privilege principle contained in it is a right, a federal right against a right to avoid federal prosecution primarily he says, by remaining silent wherever one happens to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.801" offset="8291161">It's a right that one more or less carries about inside of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.438" offset="8305685">Perhaps it flows through the bloodstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.753" offset="8314984">It's like a coat of armor protecting wherever he is or a badge that he flashes on I think in every occasion when interrogation holds some possibility of federal consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.893" offset="8363572">It doesn't matter whether he's in a federal forum or in a state forum, whether he is within the federal jurisdiction or without the federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.359" offset="8393352">This right to avoid the federal consequences always remains with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.321" offset="8413205">And so, he carried it into the New York County Grand Jury room when he was summoned there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.758" offset="8439014">And the fact that it was not a federal -- federal forum, it didn't make any difference whatsoever because he had his Fifth Amendment federal right with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.808" offset="8475167">Now, I don't have to labor that, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.404" offset="8493558">To me at least, it's obviously defective because the federal -- the Fifth Amendment doesn't create any such right that one carries with one around inside of him, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.109" offset="8548415">Whether this is a mandate, an injunction against the Federal Government from compelling a person to incriminate himself in a federal forum, whether it'd be in a federal court, a federal grand jury, or before a congressional committee as far as that's concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.628" offset="8626469">And this petition no more carried a federal right, this federal right which is so limited and narrow into our grand jury room then he would have carried a federal right into the Court of Special Sessions of New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.081" offset="8692297">That's a -- a court of misdemeanor jurisdiction, a federal right to have a jury trial there.And of course he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.093" offset="8724271">That's purely an injunction against the federal officials also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.276" offset="8753006">I don't condemn a theory because it's noble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.243" offset="8768888">I don't think I'm going to slide the precedent, but I am surprised when my friend on a basis of something so tenuous and so unsubstantial as this, says that he is here to write off or to try to straighten out 50 years of loose thinking by this Court, and those were the terms that he used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.354" offset="8853316">50 years of loose thinking along the familiar accepted stated lines which I mentioned leading up to due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2353.095" offset="9412336">The Court knows the issue there and I must proceed here on the assumption that that is the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.519" offset="9445982">And that the first eight amendments are not incorporated within the Fourteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.972" offset="9483807">Since the Fifth Amendment, and I don't think there's any dispute about this, since the Fifth Amendment is not applicable with the states, of course we must proceed to the Fourteenth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.015" offset="9524036">And when we come to the question of due process, I don't want to bore the Court with obvious propositions that what has to be established in order to spell out a violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.953" offset="9587775">It's something that's so heinous that it shocks the American conscience and shocks all our concepts of fairness in the American way of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.467" offset="9633855">No point in my spending time on that proposition nor do I have to recall you to the cases which say that although a principle of the first eight amendments maybe accepted and admired by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.469" offset="9709819">It's not necessarily one of the basic fundamental rights protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.403" offset="9745554">Of course, the right to a jury trial for example, has been held to be one that is not of that basic fundamental nature, the right to trial by indictment, protection from double jeopardy and so forth, all admirable principles no doubt, but held not to be within the order of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.207" offset="9832803">And the same is true of the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.187" offset="9852656">And again, I will have to do on that subject I think is to mention Twining against New Jersey, Palko against Connecticut, and Adamson against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.399" offset="9893512">The interesting thing about the Twining case, the leading case in this subject to me is that it flatly holds that the State can abolish the entire privilege against self-incrimination without running a file of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.525" offset="9954011">And what that means here is that if our New York provision can compel this witness as it did to appear and testify, even if it gave no protection or immunity whatsoever, not even in our ownstate courts, it still wouldn't violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.188" offset="10048679">Now, that's going quite far of course and we certainly don't have to go that far here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.882" offset="10071458">There's nothing in this case comparable to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.423" offset="10085669">New York approves of the privilege against self-incrimination as Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.349" offset="10113358">It's in our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.502" offset="10126002">And our Highest Courts have followed of course, Counselman against Hitchcock, and said that the immunity granted has to be as broad as the privilege destroyed in order to validate these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.726" offset="10186815">And in pursuant to that, New York has given all of the immunity that it possibly can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.048" offset="10212101">So we're not dealing here with an abolition of the privilege against self-incrimination or a total emasculation of it, it's from the failure to give any protection or immunity whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.290" offset="10257136">And when you look at this case realistically, you see that the danger here, and of course I suppose I'm repeating myself somewhat here, is it lies in a number of very highly speculative contingencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.257" offset="10329025">That the -- that this witness might give testimony before our grand jury indicating that he was guilty of bribe receiving under the Taft-Hartley law, that the federal prosecutor might be interested in this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2818.328" offset="11273300">I've stated how valuable these immunity provisions are to the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.011" offset="11307990">Mr. Justice Harlan asked a question at the outset of my friend's argument which I thought was a very pertinent one and I don't think it was answered squarely at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.466" offset="11361802">The question was whether if immunity provisions or it could be -- or rather, if in any field, any area where a federal crime exists covering the subject matter of the state inquiry, if the privilege was to be upheld under those circumstances, would that not emasculate, render impotence such a statute in every situation where there was a federal crime?</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.571" offset="11490220">And the answer to that is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.481" offset="11501923">In other words, any time, according to the argument, the opposing argument here, any time you have a federal crime, federal statute covering this subject matter of the state investigation, the immunity statute might just as well be written off the books for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.361" offset="11565349">And of course, those are the very important areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.302" offset="11577156">And it would be a most destructive holding and one that I think that would erect a great deal of havoc throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.672" offset="11614668">Now, I'm not claiming that the expediency should be an excuse for abrogating civil rights or for injustice of any sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.678" offset="11658658">But what I do claim here is or I do submit that the approach to these very valuable immunity provisions should not be one of trying to searching for technical constitutional defects, that it should be one of attempting to reconcile them with the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.907" offset="11751549">I say that in this case, that reconciliation is certainly very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.645" offset="11774537">I say that it is one that is based upon reason and logic and one that is supported by the authorities as they are seeing today down through the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.567" offset="11826260">And I submit that to overturn that now would both be illogical and unsolitary from a social point of view.</text>

            <text syncTime="2972.248" offset="11888953">I have a few items in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.020" offset="11908075">Counsel has stated that this is not a federal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.000" offset="11935974">If by that of course he means that there is no support in the record for the fact of involvement of this employer in interstate commerce that is not the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.041" offset="11988114">That is amply supported in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.284" offset="11997100">The man is in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.155" offset="12012565">And as a matter of fact, there is what is tantamount to a concession of such involvement right in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.788" offset="12043076">Now, of course, what makes for the reality of the exposure in this case is that the federal and state statutes cover precisely the same ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.758" offset="12095007">I answered the Chief Justice the other day to say that we have parallel legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.102" offset="12124369">In the framework in which I answered it, I think that was all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.264" offset="12137012">But I would like to call your attention now to one modification which -- of that statement, which has a bearing on an argument of counsel here this morning or this afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.374" offset="12185496">That is that the obligation of the citizen under the Taft-Hartley Act is an absolute obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.954" offset="12215798">It is not the qualified obligation that you shall not give money in order to achieve a benefit as in the case of bribery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.236" offset="12264908">It's an absolute obligation as to say you may not pay or deliver or agreed to pay or deliver under the Taft-Hartley Act for any but specified purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.609" offset="12318407">The question of the reason why you gave particular money is not relevant under the Taft-Hartley Act except to the extent that you are able to establish that it is one of admissive purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.777" offset="12387056">Another point indulged in by counsel relates to the secrecy of grand jury minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.583" offset="12418299">And the statement was made that Mr. Williams has no standing to procure those minutes from the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.594" offset="12466364">In the (Inaudible) investigation into labor activities in New York several years ago, in the very Court in which this happened, on application of the Committee, the Court divulged the minutes of the grand jury relative to (Inaudible), you may recall the incident, and those grand jury minutes were later read into the record in a televised version of the committee hearings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3962.906" offset="15851624">We unsuccessfully urged it in the state courts where we had right so to urge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3983.683" offset="15934694">In the -- in coming up here, we made an advocate's choice to come up on the narrow ground on which we did come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.015" offset="15964056">We did not advance the notion of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.000" offset="15979938">And we can't complain if this Court does not entertain the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.605" offset="16002403">But if thereto behest to our adversaries, the subject matter is entertained.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.532" offset="16026122">I'd like to call the attention of the Court to what I think is a reasonable implication from the cases where the guide to self -- self-incrimination with reference to due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.230" offset="16092891">My adversary's contentions have been based upon the Twining and Adamson cases and the cases of that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.657" offset="16138553">They are questions of the inference to be drawn from failure to testify and things of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="4041.867" offset="16167393">They're rather peripheral applications of the rule against self-incrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="4063.976" offset="16255896">There, this Court didn't hesitate to hold that due process was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.487" offset="16285884">And I suggest that the distinction is, while as I say these peripheral applications of the rule, the inferences to be drawn from failure to testify are not within the ambit of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.825" offset="16351295">Nevertheless, the actual application of compulsion to the production of testimony is a violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.944" offset="16403749">And I wanted to suggest to the Court that it makes no difference whether that compulsion is the compulsion of a deputy with a belt buckle or a Court which threatens imprisonment with a goal obtained.</text>
