            <label>Mr. Eugene Bernstein</label>
            <text syncTime="37.491" offset="149943">Not all on that particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.788" offset="163109">Your Honor, the -- the doctrines of independently illegal has been applied in certain types of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.397" offset="193515">It was pointed out in the lobbying cases, critical favors, bribery, crimes and penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.575" offset="222250">It will be Your Honor in the Textile case is strongly relied upon by counsel.We still don't find the strong language, the denial as indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.751" offset="263001">It is said in view of the fact that Congress has not provided for this deduction, but the general policy came into play.And by inference, one would assume that our Congress provided the deduction involving the expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.126" offset="316500">The general policy would not have been given consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.455" offset="337816">Now, we find in this particular section, there is a specific provision for the allowance of salaries and rents incurred in this trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.656" offset="398524">Now, a particular proposal suggested by Senator (Inaudible) who was rejected by the Senate and by the Congress rather, were caused of the desire or its realization for the treasury department will be called upon to interpret the laws of the various station and also public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.926" offset="475638">And counsel suggested that was not our intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.298" offset="493192">Now, it's very obvious that counsel is not acquainted with Illinois law.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.589" offset="510328">I'm not sure of the language, Your Honor, but it's obviously -- it states on his brief that the respondent, its employees and lessors will be guilty of a violation of the conspiracy section of the Criminal Code of the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.064" offset="572186">Our Supreme Court in Dorman versus rather People versus Dorman in 415 Illinois cited in our brief has held that the conspiracy section was not applicable to gain the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.335" offset="629238">It was a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.825" offset="639269">That is not now per se that (Inaudible) prohibited and that the penalty in the -- the conspiracy section was far in excess of that, provided under the Wagering Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.767" offset="683050">And we're also rather doubtful as to what position the Illinois courts would take as to the liability of a landlord for violation of any statute that we just set forth in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.184" offset="732682">Now, the inconsistency of the Commissioner as known as not being one of its virtues, rather, it doesn't fall consistently in theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.349" offset="777300">Now, we have it in the cases preceding our, Tank Truck Rentals.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.106" offset="796421">He argues the -- the point is independently illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.291" offset="813140">I don't know what could be more independently illegal, Your Honor, whether the employees are specifically told to go out and violate the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.003" offset="843964">It's specifically told that no withholding and then Your Honor, we don't find the Commissioner consistently disallowing the salaries of those employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.027" offset="892029">Objectively, Your Honor, the purpose is only to get the certain types of business as annunciated by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.558" offset="926198">Now, Your Honor, it is not uniformly applied in one of the general rules of taxation, is that a law should be uniformly applicable and it should be applied against one type of taxpayer as against business (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="249.443" offset="997669">Now, Your Honor, in the -- the case that I cited before about the lobbying, fines and penalties, the -- under the theory annunciated by the Commissioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.945" offset="1039778">These types of expenses are not allowed to those engage in the gaming industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.544" offset="1066109">On the (Inaudible) case, it pointed out the distinction between that type of expense and the type of expense that it can be deducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.421" offset="1093590">It specifically points out to bribery and fixing.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.676" offset="1102681">Those are not allowable expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.624" offset="1114488">Now, in the long line of decisions of the Tax Court and even including the Silverman case relied upon by the Commissioner in 44 BTA.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.934" offset="1151687">That case did not specifically disallow the deduction of salaries and rents.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.531" offset="1174047">It disallowed the taxpayer the right to claim the deduction of the excess losses, which he derived in the gambling business against income from legal sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.693" offset="1230681">On the other hand, we do find all these other cases up to including Doyle or the Tax Court that was up to 1954 has consistently held that these types of expenses were deductible and the first time we find the change of that position is in 1954, subsequent of the time when the Attorney General had made a statement that he (Inaudible) highly cooperation of the treasury department in invoking this particular provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.043" offset="1348127">Now, Your Honor, the original letter of the assessment (Inaudible) in Sullivan as in Doyle.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.197" offset="1368712">There was no disallowance of salaries or rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.997" offset="1391909">By the time the petitions failed.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="349.834" offset="1399327">In what case you would describe?</text>

          <turn speaker="eugene_bernstein" startTime="350.942" stopTime="354.523">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Bernstein</label>
            <text syncTime="350.942" offset="1403716">In either the Doyle or in this -- in the lost Sullivan case.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>

          <turn speaker="eugene_bernstein" startTime="356.727" stopTime="678.840">
            <label>Mr. Eugene Bernstein</label>
            <text syncTime="356.727" offset="1426808">At the time the petition was filed, it did not involve that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.534" offset="1442064">It was only when it was reached at the trial calendar, that the Commissioner came and asked for leave to amend this petition -- to amend those answers to set up a perimeter of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.005" offset="1483964">In both of those cases, the first time it was developed, that was in 1954, which gives the import to a particular position taken by the department.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.302" offset="1517192">I'm not opposed to the decision taken they have that right to take the position but there is no consistency of it and we find the first time it was served in the Massei case.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.120" offset="1556480">It was only 45 days before the Attorney General indicated what the position of he -- and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue were relative to his expenses, where in time for the formulation of the opinion between the two departments.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.162" offset="1616562">Now, public policy, Your Honor maybe resulted to interpret an ambiguous or vague statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.793" offset="1647073">Now, we don't have that vagueness in this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.525" offset="1666090">We find incidentally -- I can't help but comment on the ease at which counsel tries to obviate to the faith in Congress of 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.265" offset="1716976">Says, it did not apply to the gaming statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.716" offset="1730769">May I read from the Congressional record 3849, 1913 reference to which we made in our brief?</text>
            <text syncTime="440.404" offset="1761593">Senator Williams said this."</text>
            <text syncTime="442.069" offset="1768176">The object that this built is to tax a man's net income."</text>
            <text syncTime="447.367" offset="1789388">That is to say what he has at the end of the year after deducting from his receipts of the expenditures or losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.181" offset="1816660">It is not to reform men's moral characters.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.247" offset="1828885">That is not the object of the bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.279" offset="1837035">The tax is not levied for the purpose of -- people from betting on horses or upon futures, but the tax is plain for the purpose on making a man pay upon his net income, his actual profit during the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.788" offset="1895131">The law does not share where he got it from, so far as the tax is concerned, although the law may very properly appear in another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.141" offset="1940480">Counsel somewhat slips over that, as was well as he did to Senator (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="490.966" offset="1963781">In Senator (Inaudible) proposal which are followed by the treasury department and rejected by Congress, it would make the gaining deductions much easier of determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.596" offset="2010384">All that the Commissioner would have to determine -- that Congress from -- Senator (Inaudible) amend and accepted was whether or not the business was illegal or a lawful one.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.583" offset="2054269">We're under the theory annunciated by the Commission of independently illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.557" offset="2074227">It will be necessary to determine whether each item of expense claimed for deduction would come within the purview of Section 23 (a) (1) (A).</text>
            <text syncTime="532.077" offset="2128248">As I've indicated, Your Honor, here, we have a specific provision of the statute, permitting a deduction, permitting the deduction of all necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.679" offset="2162625">There is no limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.683" offset="2170671">There is no limitation as -- let me quote from the decision in Commissioner versus Heininger that Judge (Inaudible) held.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.976" offset="2231902">He said this is -- we are asked in the guise of construing the words ordinary and necessary to amend the statute, in other words, to engage in a little judicial legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.922" offset="2279654">We declined the invitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.881" offset="2299507">And then also indicating that decision of a change was to be made, it was to be made by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.801" offset="2327197">He pointed out specifically all that Congress had to do was to add in one word in between ordinary and necessary business expense is lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.166" offset="2380591">All we have to make out lawful expense as incurred in any trade or business and this Congress repeatedly rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.193" offset="2412669">It rejected it even the first income tax law passed in 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.224" offset="2428865">And incidentally, there was one of the amendments was proposed in the 1913 Act, to act -- to provide that all -- only deduction maybe plain and lawful business and that suggestion of Senator Sterling was rejected, same as the similar efforts of Senator (Inaudible) were to amend the bill, the wagering excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.081" offset="2512248">Your Honor, as we pointed out, we have not only that gross tax on wagering under the Wagering Act, a little more so in determining gross ordinarily you will take the total amount wagered, plus the amount paid off on the wagers, known as the (Inaudible) and then the balance of the gross.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.681" offset="2602632">But here, we taxed the total amount, not gross under the Wagering Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.822" offset="2623216">Now, with this contention of the Commission is to be adhered to, we find another gross tax with a mere deduction of small items with 22% of the total expense would result in a tax of net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.249" offset="2696986">Well, I'll leave that to the Court to determine.</text>

            <text syncTime="697.205" offset="2788728">I believe he was a member of the -- of the Committee on the taxation (Inaudible) drive that from the general debates.</text>

            <text syncTime="706.836" offset="2827285">Now, I will move to that technically in the brief when I give the citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.909" offset="2911608">I believe, Your Honors has pointed out (Inaudible) I'm not over squeamish.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.965" offset="2939820">I had trouble in -- the Commission of Internal Revenue has recently held that sums expended by American businessmen providing foreign officials as well as for paying rebates to representatives of foreign governments by American businessmen, constitute of deductible expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.149" offset="3016516">That was a recent ruling that he gave, I believe it was Senator Williams if I'm not mistaken (Inaudible), the Chairman of the Committee that appears in (Inaudible) in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.119" offset="3076389">However, a similar deduction launched to American businessmen are not -- is not allowed for that type of expense paid to domestic officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.543" offset="3154129">Now, Congress is the -- pointed out as a sole authority to modify the law but not to the courts or to the Commissioner even though they may improve upon the scheme of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.956" offset="3191745">And another theory of taxation, Your Honor, is that the income tax law should be equal in its administration and you had that U.S versus (Inaudible), Burnet versus Harmel, and Your Honor, in the case of -- justice -- well, the justice of our Supreme Court versus Dolman if I recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.457" offset="3317760">And that case, Your Honor, was the -- the judge of the Supreme Court held that the provisions of the income tax law will not (Inaudible) and that it had violated the Constitution of the State of Illinois.</text>

            <text syncTime="847.730" offset="3390903">That the imposition of this tax will tend to diminish his salary, (Inaudible) made short statement on that and held that the federal laws were not depending upon state constitutions or upon state laws and their application.</text>

            <text syncTime="870.216" offset="3480764">This should be allowed as a deduction, all the cost and expenses necessarily incurred in the production of that income.</text>

            <text syncTime="897.193" offset="3588702">Mr. Chief Justice, I understand I have about a minute left.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.973" offset="3603853">I'd like to be sure to make clear to the Court that the Government does not think there is a limitation on the power of the United States to levy a gross income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.226" offset="3672816">Now, the Constitution does not prohibit the levying of a gross income tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.657" offset="3698625">Now, we do have problems in regard to classification of due process, if the classification is not a reasonable classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.654" offset="3742616">But it's the position of the Government in this case that whether a person is in a legal or in illegal activity that he could not deduct for the expenses that he incurred in inducing someone else to commit a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.759" offset="3826939">And we do not think that the wagering tax is a tax, only the better for wager at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.120" offset="3880438">It's a tax on the man who gives the -- the money to the bookmaker and the bookmaker is merely a collector of that tax, but it is a gross tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.087" offset="4196310">Well, the statute doesn't say that purchasing a pad as such is illegal, but it does say recording a better wager is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.860" offset="4239360">So, the act of these men were being paid for is independently illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.398" offset="4265587">It's just like you would ask someone to go out and commit a crime for you and you pay him $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.472" offset="4289829">That is exactly what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.723" offset="4294844">Now, if you go out and ask him to buy you a pad and you want to commit some kind of a crime, that's what's involved in the other and it's more remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.620" offset="4338416">This Court dealt in the Heininger case with the fact that where it's more remote and different problem and the one -- the Government isn't saying that all of that type of expenses could in all cases be recognized, but they aren't involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.795" offset="4415112">This is case where it's a direct violation of the state law, a very act that he's paid for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.036" offset="4448131">And there was no showing that these acts were not for this very purpose of recording the bets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.400" offset="4481567">Under our theory, if you could separate them out and show that a portion of his time was devoted to some other purpose, then we would -- I would assume at least that that part could be separately deducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.403" offset="4545515">But in this case, there was no such showing and it was -- that he was engaged in this unlawful activity and the Court specifically found that this were acts that were in violation of these state statutes.</text>
