            <text syncTime="59.017" offset="236042">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.163" offset="236565">This is the -- I -- there was a -- accord to what I'm going to say though, Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.483" offset="257881">What I wanted to say next was that this ordinance is represented of the great and growing number of such ordinances found, so far as I researched presently discloses throughout the south and not the north which is why I made a point I did.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.293" offset="341159">A union organizer was convicted from the City of Baxley, Georgia under a licensing ordinance and this is the ultimate appeal from the conviction which has been sustained through the Georgia Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.773" offset="419004">In February 1954, two organizers of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union appeared in the City of Baxley.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.128" offset="460487">They had been sent there to organize or try to organize the plant of the Hazelhurst Manufacturing Company which is located in Hazelhurst, Georgia, a town which neighbors Baxley.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.107" offset="524330">The Hazelhurst Manufacturing Company is a company engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.502" offset="557976">It draws its workers both from the town of -- the City of Hazelhurst and also from the City of Baxley.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.977" offset="595905">And these organizers were staying at a motel in Baxley and were trying to solicit among others, residents of the City of Baxley.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.846" offset="647314">I might add parenthetically that the City of Hazelhurst has an ordinance which is almost verbatim, a copy of the Baxley ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.374" offset="693394">On this day, on February 15th, 1954, when they first came there on a Monday, they approached two workers at the home of one of them on the porch of one them, the workers, told them that they were trying to get the workers of the Hazelhurst Manufacturing Company to join the union and discussed the union with them, arrange or survey to hold a -- another meeting on Friday, that written on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.128" offset="808438">And that meeting took place Friday at noon again in the home of one of the workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.696" offset="838740">At that meeting there were four workers present together with the two organizers.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.147" offset="860578">At the meeting, the organizers discussed with them the advantages of joining the union, urge them to join, told them about the membership cards that they had, told them among other things that the dues were 64 cents a week, and a discussion went on concerning the advantages and disadvantages of joining the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.733" offset="962873">Nobody joined during that noon meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.336" offset="981264">But there were some further discussion about having a further meeting that evening at which additional workers would be present to be held at 7 o'clock that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.781" offset="1031105">But before that meeting could be held, the Police Chief of Baxley arrested these two organizers.And they were charged with the offense, I'm quoting.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.753" offset="1090978">“The offense of soliciting members for an organization without a permit or license.”</text>
            <text syncTime="281.001" offset="1123997">Now, the ordinance in question was passed in 1949 and as appears from the original question and answer transcript, Mr. Highsmith, the city solicitor, my learned adversary, stated there that he thinks he wrote that ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.613" offset="1202364">Now, the ordinance appears on pages 9 to 11 of the record and I would like briefly to summarize it.The ordinance is a 9-section ordinance, starts at the bottom of page 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.974" offset="1279896">And essentially, the first section provides that before any person -- it doesn't have to be, mind you, a person who was paid for his actions or who receives any remuneration of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.808" offset="1347187">Any person who solicits membership for any organization, union or society of any sort which requires from its members the payments of membership fees, dues or is entitled to make assessments, must apply to the Mayor and to the City Council for a permit to solicit members.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.653" offset="1446557">Section II then goes on, “To set forth the kind of information that must be provided in the application for the permit among other things that requires you to name the officers of the organization, and whether you are a salaried employee of the organization.”</text>
            <text syncTime="380.136" offset="1520536">Section III goes on to say that, “This application shall be submitted to a meeting of the Mayor and the City Council and provision was made for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.401" offset="1557525">And Section IV is a critical section indeed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="394.681" offset="1578632">I like to read it to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.958" offset="1583752">It says that, “In passing upon such application, the Mayor and Council shall consider the character of the applicant, the nature of the business of the organization for which members are desired to be solicited, and its effects upon the general welfare of citizens -- of the citizen of the City of Baxley.”</text>
            <text syncTime="416.643" offset="1666508">The next section was on to talk about the grant or refusal of the licence on how -- how that is to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.369" offset="1697437">And then Section VI is another critical section.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.990" offset="1707886">It provides that in the event that person is a salaried employee or an officer, then the permit shall only be issued upon payment of a slight little fee of $2000 per year, and to make sure that it's very clear, it goes on to say, “Also $500 for each member obtained.”</text>
            <text syncTime="448.810" offset="1795239">And then, the remaining sections provide that penalties for non-compliance of the ordinance or appeal at any conflicting ordinances and a separability clause.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="459.338" offset="1837349">What is it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="morris_p_glushien" startTime="460.951" stopTime="885.108">
            <label>Mr. Morris P. Glushien</label>
            <text syncTime="460.951" offset="1843722">Penalty under this simply says that it would be the same as provided by Section 85 of the Criminal Code, and I'm sorry to say Your Honor, I don't know what that is except that the particular penalty in this case on the conviction was a fine of $300 or 30 days in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.735" offset="1914880">Now, this ordinance, this arrest took place and the trial followed in the Mayor's Court of the City of Baxley.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.779" offset="1959079">In the Mayor's Court, the two organizers, Staub and Merritt, represented by a competent counsel who raised in detail or very carefully, the same federal constitutional questions and also questions under the state constitution which we hope we are presenting to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.555" offset="2030132">He did show that, and I may add had that these constitutional questions were preserved at every later stage of the appeals through the Georgia courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.352" offset="2077362">They were convicted, as I said, and fined of $300 or 30 days on each of the two organizers to receive the same penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.459" offset="2105783">And parenthetically, I should say that we have here only the Staub appeal, and by stipulation of counsel, it is agreed of the outcome of the Merritt conviction shall await the -- and be handled in the same way as the Staub case.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.462" offset="2165760">Now, in an effort to try to dispose of this more speedily, the union instituted a declaratory judgment action in the Superior Court of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.800" offset="2235141">I think immediately after the arrest as I recall, the Superior Court judge dismissed the complaint in the declaratory judgment action of which we sought to restrain the holding of the trial on the ground that the statute, the ordinance was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.356" offset="2297417">And we took an appeal from that dismissal directly to the Supreme Court of Georgia which sustained the dismissal of the declaratory judgment complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.804" offset="2343184">And thereupon, the Mayor's Court conviction or a criminal proceeding as I should say, continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.723" offset="2386860">After the conviction took place, we took an appeal to the next layer of the Georgia courts which is the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.656" offset="2438583">I want to tell you that in order to take such an appeal, you have to file a bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.203" offset="2472751">And immediately after the conviction on -- in March 1954, the very same afternoon or evening, our counsel presented that fine to the clerk of the court and asked, “Are you the clerk of the Mayor's Court?”</text>
            <text syncTime="639.061" offset="2556238">Because on the Georgia procedure, if she was the clerk of the Mayor's Court, then she had it countersigned or approved the bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.510" offset="2581943">If there wasn't a clerk, the mayor himself had to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.656" offset="2594586">Being assured that she was the clerk of the Mayor's Court, he handed her the bond with typewritten words on it saying the clerk of the Mayor's Court, she signed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.072" offset="2628232">We took the appeal to the Superior Court and after a while, the city moved to dismiss on the ground that she wasn't really the clerk of the Mayor's Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.056" offset="2656131">She was only the clerk of the City Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.584" offset="2666266">And the Superior Court threw out that appeal without appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.052" offset="2684134">Well, on a further appeal to the Georgia courts, that was reversed and it came back to the Superior Court with instructions to hear our appeal on the merits, the bond was sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.018" offset="2724049">There, we were again on merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.164" offset="2732617">This time the Superior Court denies the appeal again, and despite the fact that the constitutional questions had been fully presented, it will -- no opinion at all denied on the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.413" offset="2793639">We then appealed to the Court of Appeals which is the next mayor and the Georgia structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.565" offset="2826240">In the Court of Appeals, the conviction was affirmed again, this time we could get an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.906" offset="2859572">But the Court didn't pass on the constitutionality at all and said it's unnecessary to do so, and why?</text>
            <text syncTime="723.294" offset="2893113">Well, two reasons, the Court assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.573" offset="2906279">One, that if Staub wanted to challenge this ordinance, she should have applied for a permit first.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.339" offset="2957270">And having failed to apply to affirm it under the ordinance, she had no standing to challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.003" offset="2987990">This ground by the way, is one which had been ruled out specifically by this very Court in Lovell against Griffin, not too many years before, also at Georgia case and which was presented to this Court of Appeals again in -- in our briefs and again on rehearing, again they -- they never mentioned Lovell against Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.116" offset="3060402">But as I say, held that we had no standing to challenge this ordinance because we haven't applied for a permit under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.237" offset="3088927">The second ground they assigned was that we had challenged the ordinance as an entirety instead of specifying which of these nine sections we thought were unconstitutional, but we thought all of them unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.215" offset="3148800">The ordinance only relates to one subject matter, and we challenged the entire ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.836" offset="3171265">And as we make clear in our brief, both under Georgia practice, that was the proper procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.421" offset="3205642">The Georgia Supreme Court has held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.466" offset="3213793">And a state court cannot deny our rights to challenge an ordinance on federal grounds by preventing us from attacking an entire ordinance when in fact the entire ordinance is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.977" offset="3263843">Anyway, the Court of Appeals denied our application for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.606" offset="3286413">The Supreme Court of Georgia denied an application for certiorari without any opinion and we then came to this Court which noted probable jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.229" offset="3320895">Now, we challenge this ordinance on a number of grounds, claiming first that it violates our rights under the First Amendment to engage in associational activities to speak freely, to write freely to assemble.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.130" offset="3412428">That it violates our rights under the due process clause of the Constitution, that it violates our rights under the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.393" offset="3445551">And finally, since this is a company which engages an interstate commerce, the workers of which in Hazelhurst Manufacturing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.913" offset="3475644">That factually has no power to present qualifications on the right of the organizers to urge the workers of this company engaged in commerce to join a union of their choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1116.565" offset="4466207">To get a fee -- to get a permit, if you are a salaried employee, you have to, in addition, pay this license fee of $2000 plus $500 for each member obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.098" offset="4508317">This -- I think the -- the violation here was the contended violation, pardon me, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.735" offset="4538932">Now, I think it is evident under the decisions that the First Amendment rights of association and press and assembly have been infringed by an ordinance such as this which provides that the Mayor and the City Council from denying a permit, if they think it is “not in the best interest of the citizens, uniting the general welfare of the citizens of Baxley that the permit be granted” or they think that they don't like the “business of the organization for which members have desire to be solicited”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.943" offset="4683755">Mind you, this requirement doesn't apply only to -- to paid organizers, it applies to any person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.732" offset="4714893">And so presumably, one worker urging another worker to join the union of his choice would also be covered by this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.802" offset="4751151">And I was telling my little daughter at breakfast this morning, presumably, if she urged a little girl to join the girl scouts which is and also an organization, appears that -- which charges dues of about $1 a year, that too would be a violation under literal terms of this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.979" offset="4835892">So, I think it is perfectly plain that this brought an absolute discretion under the many decisions of this Court, is itself enough to render this ordinance unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.495" offset="4881972">Now, as Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out, the city concedes that the prohibitory character of the large fees is another reason why this ordinance is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.883" offset="4923455">But our position as I've indicated, is that any of my license taxes bond both because it infringes rights under the First Amendment and because in this case where commerce is involved, it infringes rights which the city has no power to regulate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1281.694" offset="5126687">That licensing provisions might in some cases be valid, although I got to point out, and then this is again our position, basically that this Court has held in the Murdock against Pennsylvania case and in the Opelika case and others that you cannot require a license fee of this -- of any kind of a religious evangelist (Inaudible)</text>

            <text syncTime="1641.433" offset="6565721">As I said, I -- I want to discuss briefly the -- whether we have actually a decision here by the state court on the -- on a federal question on the constitutionality of this ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.022" offset="6624026">It's true that there has been extended litigation upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.167" offset="6644611">It was the -- have been -- the criminal litigation was pending in the Mayor's Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.529" offset="6670106">Counsel for the appellants brought an action for a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.625" offset="6694452">We raised the point on the merit, two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.778" offset="6707096">One, that when the criminal action was pending and that you could raise that question in that criminal action, that then the Court's practice was not to issue a restraining order and restrain the criminal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.933" offset="6759654">Otherwise, since the plea (Inaudible) attacked the ordinance as a whole and didn't point out any particular sections of it as being invalid that therefore, it was not a proper attack on the constitutionality of the action under Georgia procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.763" offset="6831020">The Superior Court does not in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.406" offset="6841574">As a matter of fact, it's right in the opinion to say as of -- just say we sustained the demurrer or you refuse a certiorari and don't write -- written -- don't give written opinion except in vey exceptional cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.230" offset="6892878">Our judge never do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.533" offset="6902073">He did -- he did sustain the demurrer to the declaratory action and that was held proper by the Supreme Court of Georgia saying that this was a question they could raise and the criminal's action, it was pending in the city court and it was not a matter for equity to pass on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.208" offset="6980754">And that was the decision there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.614" offset="6990367">They do have -- they came back and it was pried then in the city court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.243" offset="7008967">Now, I want -- and on the question and while we're on the question of the trial, it is I think important in this case for it to be brought out that this case goes further than the case -- that the evidence in the case to Thomas versus Collins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.892" offset="7079497">On the trial, it appeared from two of the workers that were present, had testified on the trial before the Mayor's Court that the organizers in this case solicited money from them, that they told them their dues were 64 cents a week and that if they would pay two weeks in advance, that they would write, then issue them a membership card.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.503" offset="7197989">In other words, they were selling membership to this particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.072" offset="7216274">We distinguished it from Thomas versus Collins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.298" offset="7229127">And after -- on that appeal in Mayor's Court, some reflection has been made or that the Courts, were just trying to sustain some technicalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.270" offset="7273012">They do have the rule and a lot of technical rules with reference to certiorari, I think in most every court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.761" offset="7299030">They have the rule that if the Mayor's Court does not have a clerk, then the mayor approves a bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.043" offset="7328078">Now, the clerk was not asked, was she a clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.007" offset="7343961">Of course, Mr. Glushien wasn't there and he couldn't be -- he doesn't make an intention anywhere about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.623" offset="7366426">The party there was asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.446" offset="7373740">My friend, Leanne Wilson asked me, “Does the city have a clerk?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.422" offset="7389623">Or that's what I understood him to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.823" offset="7399236">“Does the city have a clerk?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.994" offset="7407909">And I said, “Yes, the city has a clerk, Ms. (Inaudible).”</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.137" offset="7424522">Later, she -- she was put on the stand and he asked you the question, “What is your idea?</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.213" offset="7448764">What are your -- what is your official position with the city?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.673" offset="7462661">And she said, “Clerk of the Mayor and Council of the City of Baxley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.312" offset="7481156">That was her answer at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.212" offset="7496829">And if any misrepresentation was made, it wasn't the clerk of the City of Baxley.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.191" offset="7520758">It was -- if the city attorney could speak, then it -- it was certainly not a misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.159" offset="7544581">There was an issue as to whether he said, “Does the Mayor's Court have a clerk and do the city have a clerk?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.716" offset="7566838">My recollection in the statement was that he said, “Does the city have a clerk?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.950" offset="7583765">Didn't -- isn't important in this case except to show there wasn't any just trying to get these people put out of court on technicality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.490" offset="7617933">We did take the position and he said, “Well, she signed it as clerk of the City Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.423" offset="7645623">I might well say we -- that he went somewhat out of the record at the same time and it doesn't -- important to me as she signed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.115" offset="7680418">At the same time, the Mayor signed an approval of the bond over a typewritten signature of the clerk of the city court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.351" offset="7717303">I guess if you do those things without notice and they per se sign them, they sign them without too much notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.746" offset="7738932">I said I didn't object to them being signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.691" offset="7750740">And I made that point that there wasn't a proper bond and the Superior Court sustained it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.786" offset="7771115">The clerk -- the Court of Appeals sent a -- that Mr. Wilson could have been misled and that they didn't want it passed on, on that ground but wanted to hear it, have it heard on its merits and send it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.686" offset="7830674">Again, we -- we raised the same question that they hadn't, under Georgia procedure, properly attacked here the constitutionality of the order because the rule in Georgia is that one section might be constitutional and another section not constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.247" offset="7912908">And therefore, if you're on a race, the -- the question of the invalidity of an ordinance, you have to point out those particular sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.982" offset="7943837">Now, that may sound or may not sound like an unreasonable rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.130" offset="7960451">But that is a practice that the appellate courts have followed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.864" offset="7975393">The first important case, I recall about it, was Glover versus Rome back in 1931.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.433" offset="7997649">That same specific thing was held by the Supreme Court of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.412" offset="8013636">The next case was in 1945, Anthony versus the City of Atlanta, they held exactly the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.090" offset="8044356">And those cases were pointed out to -- by a counsel or two counsels for appellant on this arguments that we had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.705" offset="8074762">We had this specific volume to the Georgia's report there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.092" offset="8088346">They knew about it but they -- they persisted in going along the way that they have gone and the Court of Appeal sustained and the Superior Court judge said that that was good, that they hadn't property attacked the constitutionality of it and decided it that, the certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.815" offset="8163161">When it got to the Court of Appeals, we made the same argument and the Court of Appeals, as is the rule that they won't go into a constitutionality of a -- of a question if they can decide it without by -- without deciding on the constitutionality as always.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.253" offset="8228989">I believe that same rule prevails almost universally in this Court too, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.072" offset="8252186">And they held that there has not been, under Georgia practice, a proper attack on the constitutionality of this ordinance and specifically did not pass on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.620" offset="8310387">We take the position and very strongly that the Court did decide it on an adequate non-federal ground and that this Court could very properly hold that the Court did do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.775" offset="8375066">And as I understand it, the rule of this Court is that unless there is a question of evasion by the state court, that what the practice -- the rules of practice are in a particular state, what that -- that state court says they are will be followed but this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.325" offset="8453224">Now, of course, if this Court should decide that before Court of Appeals of Georgia and the Supreme Court of Georgia were as furiously as a -- say in their brief, evading the issue and there was an evasion, then of course say it could this question on its merits.</text>
