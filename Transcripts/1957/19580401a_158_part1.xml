            <text syncTime="28.527" offset="114103">This is Ms. Milda Hopkins Ashdown, the brief of the petitioner setting out the jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under 28 U.S.C.A. Section 1257.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.453" offset="237714">The judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Utah entered on April the 30th, 1956 -- 1956, a petition which was denied, it was unanimous decision of the Supreme Court of Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.461" offset="357773">This petition for writ of certiorari was filed on December the 7th, 1956 and a brief on opposition was filed by the respondent and the certiorari was allowed by this Court on June the 30th -- 30, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.651" offset="478563">I've set out the record carefully.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.145" offset="492565">Now, the constitutional provision is first the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides in pertinent part.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.237" offset="572918">I don't think I'll have to read that, Your Honors, all of that in Article 7, I've set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.967" offset="615863">Third, the self-incrimination and Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and also the Utah section is quite set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.708" offset="698828">Now, the question presented before this Court whether the petitioner in a state capital case was denied due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.881" offset="791510">The facts is this, the petitioner was taken in for question, questioning in a an emotional state and irrational state of mind immediately after the funeral of her deceased husband and was subjected to a series of constant interrogation by the sheriff and his deputies and the district attorneys for approximately five-and-a-half hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.863" offset="931422">During the time, the petitioner did not have food, rest, was not properly advised of her constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.620" offset="982413">She requested -- her relatives requested to go in there and they were denied that privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.481" offset="1025881">She asked for legal counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.127" offset="1048451">That was refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.915" offset="1059631">The record -- I have set the record up very carefully in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.920" offset="1087634">She was denied those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.535" offset="1122116">Now, we set up this constant interrogation by the sheriff and his deputies without friends or relatives and the petitioner under three was denied due process of law because the jury under instructions says -- were asked to pass on weight and credibility given to the testimony concerning such admissions upon the considerations and the circumstances ruling on the testimony of all the witnesses in relation to there was not given to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.655" offset="1338619">Now, the statement of the case, it shows that the petitioner Milda Hopkins charges -- she was charged by information with murder in the first degree and the trial was held in Parowan from July the 5th -- no, excuse me please.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.839" offset="1483337">She was charged with murder in first degree in Iron County, Utah for killing a person of Ray Ashdown, the record shows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.101" offset="1548330">A trial was had before a jury in Iron counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.896" offset="1571527">Counsel for the petitioner, which I represent, has followed this case to all courts and they're (Inaudible) as to affidavit and also a pauperism in this kind -- in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.863" offset="1651357">Now, the testimony shows the oral confession made by the petitioner during the interrogation, it was obtained in violation of her constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.349" offset="1737352">I've set the record down, record 88.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.526" offset="1762011">But the trial court ruled, admitted -- admitted such testimony, no other evidence was given after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.148" offset="1832542">The defendants rested and raised these provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.418" offset="1865665">Later, the petitioner appealed from her conviction to the Supreme Court of the State of Utah and the Supreme Court of the State of Utah affirmed the judgment of conviction on April the 30th, 1956, shown in the record at page 153 and denied the petition for rehearing, October the 5th, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.544" offset="1994083">On December the 17th petition was filed for the writ of certiorari which was granted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.013" offset="2035984">Now, the petitioner was the wife of Ray Ashdown, they lived at Cedar City, Utah.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.552" offset="2098155">And on the morning of July the 5th, 1955, Dr. Williams was called at the Ashdown home and Mrs. Ashdown to attend her -- by Mr. -- Mrs. Ashdown to attend to her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.374" offset="2177463">When the doctor arrived, Mr. Ashdown was having a generalized convulsion, seizure and death was imminent.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.610" offset="2250397">And took another convulsion immediately after and died.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.951" offset="2283729">Later, the stomach was sent to the state chemist, analyzed and there was strychnine found in the body of Ray Ashdown.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.679" offset="2354678">And on the 9th day of July 1955, the funeral was held at the cemetery.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.739" offset="2402952">At the cemetery, the sheriff of Iron County, Arthur Nielsen asked Mrs. Ashdown's son-in-law to bring Mrs. Ashdown to the city and county building, which he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.211" offset="2472751">The defendant came with her sister and at that time there was present the sheriff and his three or four or five deputies.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.521" offset="2550073">It was a hot day and they served the girls with lemonade.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.616" offset="2594377">There were -- and the sheriff at that time went into the court room and said that he wanted to talk to Milda alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.147" offset="2660519">When she arrived in the court room, the three sheriffs were there plus the District Attorney and she was interrogated for, the record shows, five-and-a-half hours, interrogated.</text>
