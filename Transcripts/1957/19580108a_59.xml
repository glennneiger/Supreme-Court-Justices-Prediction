            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="">-- what I was saying at adjournment yesterday afternoon, Northern Pacific land grant amounted to approximately 39 and a half million acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.686" offset="50678">All of this acreage has at all times been for sale and as fast as the sentence could be induced to the company and as purchasers could be found, the land had been sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.888" offset="107520">So that at the time the complaint was filed in May, 1949, the company had sold all but approximately 2,700,000 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.985" offset="167915">In the sales of these lands, the traffic clauses were ever used where the lands were agriculture in character or were grazing lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.928" offset="239700">But in the case of lands which were valuable solely for their natural resources such as timber, minerals, coal and iron and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.960" offset="303752">Traffic clauses were used from the beginning of the character that I have explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.968" offset="327784">Because those natural resources had a special value to the Northern Pacific and not to obtainable market price and that Northern Pacific have a transportation agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.427" offset="409704">It had railroad to transport these commodities to market to resume the transportation business.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.488" offset="685871">Those were in -- principally in North Dakota and they're practically old and sold to agricultural lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.796" offset="719099">Very little remained in Northwestern Improvement Company ownership although I think the Improvement Company did have some timberlands in Montana.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.885" offset="759536">And as I've stated to yesterday, the Improvement Company has at all times has been treated as the department of the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.829" offset="791301">The land department of the railroad is the land department of the Improvement Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.109" offset="816379">And this -- well it doesn't appear in the record, we are now in the process of dissolving the Improvement Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.214" offset="860787">Of the lands that had been sold, only 2,144,000 acres were timberlands subject to traffic clauses and all but about 218,000 acres of that 2,144,000 were sold prior to 1910, 900,000 acres were sold to warehouses in 1900 and the traffic clauses in that contract expired in 1915.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.777" offset="1015014">The Railway Company as I say had an interest in land -- in the natural resources and when the lands containing coal or iron which I might say were included in the grant were sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.752" offset="1087007">Generally, the minerals were accepted and reserved to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.548" offset="1114175">If other minerals were suspected to be present, a reservation of minerals is also made so that in 1949, the Railway Company had about -- had mineral rates in about six and a half million acres of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.549" offset="1194109">In all leases of it are mineral rights or timberlands or cutting timber or for removal of natural resources.</text>

            <text syncTime="358.947" offset="1435690">There are quite a number of cases of the books, where the reasonableness or the validity of traffic clauses of this character had been before the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.446" offset="1561704">I say uniformly in the Revenue case in this Court about 253 U.S., two types of the traffic clauses were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.277" offset="1613009">One where the (Inaudible) have leased a shipper's railroad from the shipper serving the shipper's coal mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.344" offset="1657313">And the lease contained the provision that the shipper would ship three fourths of his coal over the leased line and the line of (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="425.595" offset="1702348">The Court said that the claim of violation of the Sherman Act was too insubstantial to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.465" offset="1737770">Other traffic clauses involved in that case were found to be a part of the scheme for the monopolization of the coal of the school fields in Pennsylvania and its transportation to markets, and were condemned as being a part of that scheme of monopolization.</text>

            <text syncTime="501.595" offset="2006309">And I say that the word “rates being equal” implies service equality because unless the services are the same, you can't compare the rates.</text>
