            <text syncTime="245.715" offset="982831">Upon his return from the Armed Forces, he made his application for re-employment as was his right under the statute and was in fact reemployed and resumed his employment on October 7 of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.665" offset="1038629">At that time, he was permitted to displace the appointee of November 22, that is the non-employee hired to fill the vacancy in the assistant cashier's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.603" offset="1090351">He was given a seniority date in this group 1 position of October 7, 1952 and he immediately protested this to his employer claiming that he was entitled to an earlier seniority date of either September 8 or 10, 1952 when the two positions in group 1 were first bulletined or advertised.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.583" offset="1278328">He requested or made application to his employer that he'd be permitted under the -- under Rule 23 of the collective bargaining agreement to exercise his seniority right to -- and to displace the bill clerk who, at that time, continued to be the appointee of the -- preceding September 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.332" offset="1365264">This request by Mr. McKinney was likewise denied by his employer solely on the ground that -- with the seniority date of October 7, 1952, he was junior to the incumbent bill clerk and therefore, he had no rights to bump the bill clerk under the bills of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
