            <text syncTime="22.559" offset="90175">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.641" offset="106475">This case is here under the certiorari of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.444" offset="141688">The Board found in this case that the Bowman Transportation Company violated the National Labor Relations Act by unlawfully assisting in District 50 in establishing itself as the exclusive bargaining representative of the company's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.884" offset="215458">The Board's order in relevant part requires the employer to withhold recognition from District 50 as the exclusive bargaining representative of its employees until or unless District 50 is certified by the Board as the exclusive bargaining representative of the company's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.026" offset="300095">The question presented here is whether the Board may so condition the future recognition of District 50 as the exclusive bargaining representative of the company's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.518" offset="350041">In -- in view of the circumstance that District 50 has chosen not to comply with the following requirement of Sections 9 (f), (g) and (h) and therefore, the Board's selection procedures are not available for the purpose of determining District 50â€˜s representative status or for the purpose of getting a certification by District 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.185" offset="444709">The court below thought that the Board (Inaudible) to impose this condition upon the future recognition of District 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.284" offset="481071">The facts which give rise to this question may be summarized quite briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.520" offset="506044">In 1953, the Teamsters Union sought to organize the company's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.276" offset="529032">The company was opposed, to the Teamsters' efforts to organize its employees and manifested that opposition by various unfairly labor practice, including the discharge of one employee which contorted treatment of another who had supported the Teamsters Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.547" offset="594129">In contrast to its opposition to the Teamsters Union, the company readily adhered to suggestions, had a deal with District 50 as bargaining representative of company's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.762" offset="643030">Shortly after these suggestions were made to the company, the company -- and what I'm about to say took place within a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.706" offset="674795">The company met with representatives of District 50 and before District 50 represented a single employee of this company, the company and the representatives of District 50 negotiated a virtually complete contract, covering terms and conditions of employment for the -- for the company's employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.770" offset="751073">Thereafter, the company at its own expense, summoned from various terminals, in different cities throughout the south, all of its -- its employees to come to company headquarters and they did this and it paid -- it paid for their expenses in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.910" offset="815543">When the employees reported at the company's main headquarters, they were shown the contract which they could expect if they selected District 50 as their bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.701" offset="866743">Thereafter, the employees were polled by the company openly as to whether they desired to be represented by District 50 and all the employees present some 75 out of 100 employees of the company indicated that they wanted to be represented by District 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.860" offset="923376">In addition, the company also offered to advance the money for the payment of their dues to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.515" offset="950021">Shortly after all the employees had signed cards indicating that they wished to be represented by District 50, under the circumstances that I have disclosed, the company met with the representatives of District 50 and within the space of a couple of hours, they consummated or signed the contract which was virtually identical to the one that the company and the union had negotiated before the union had represented any employee of the company and also was similar to the contract which was shown to the employees when they were told that this was the kind of a contract they could expect if they selected District 50 as their bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.693" offset="1086694">Thereafter, the company permitted District 50 to use its premises for the purpose of conducting some union business.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.497" offset="1117936">The Board found that by this conduct the employer had assisted District 50 in establishing itself as the representative of the employees in violation of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.258" offset="1169032">The Board's remedial order, fairly in standard form, requires the company to refrain from engaging in the unfair labor practice found by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.242" offset="1216888">It requires the company to undo the discrimination against the two employees who had supported the Teamsters Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.939" offset="1243742">The Boards order also requires the company to cease giving effect to the contract with District 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.875" offset="1271432">It requires the company to withhold recognition from District 50 as the employees' exclusive bargaining representative until such time as District 50 is certified by the Board as the bargaining representative of its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.315" offset="1325244">And finally, the Board's order requires the company to post notices for 60 days in substance giving assurances to the employees, that the company will obey the Board's order.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="354.780" offset="1419076">That -- that's correct, the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.612" offset="1430361">There could be no charge for this sort of thing against District 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.785" offset="1463066">Statute -- Section 82 of the statute makes an unfair labor practice for the employer to support, assist or dominate the whole organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.917" offset="1503608">The court below approved the Board's unfair labor practice findings in this case and even forced the Board's order except that part of the order which enjoins the company from recognizing District 50 as the employers bargaining representative until such time as it is certified by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.481" offset="1585842">The -- the order as now modified by the decree of the court below, which appears at page 64 of the record, now reads as follows, that the company shall cease-and-desist from that's in paragraph (d) above the middle the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.615" offset="1674449">The company shall cease-and-desist from recognizing District 50, United Mine Workers as the representative of its employees and I will skip a few lines, unless and until the said labor organization shall have been as certified as such represented by the National Labor Relations Board or -- and this is the part that the court below added to the Board's order, or shall have been freely chosen as such by a majority of the employees after all effects of unfair labor practice have been eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.582" offset="1790328">The -- as I have said, the court below thought that Board-like power to condition the future recognition of District 50 upon a Board certification and the minute they ordered in this fashion, and the underlying reason which the Court gave for so many in the order in its -- in its opinion was that once the employer has complied with the other provisions of the Board's order and has posted the notice required by the order for 60 days, it can be assumed that normalcy has been restored and that the employees will then be free -- will -- would then feel free that the ill effects of the employer's unfair labor practices would have been remedied and that the employees will then feel free to choose District 50 as their bargaining representative but without the necessity of a Board election.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.228" offset="2004846">The basic problem which we have in this case touches of course upon the Board's power to choose remedies for the -- the redress of unfair labor practice and for the purpose of effectuating the statutory policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.491" offset="2061897">The Board's power in this respect stems, of course, from Section 10 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.331" offset="2081228">Section 10 of the Act empowers the Board to require any person who is engaged in unfair labor practice to cease-and-desist from such unfair labor practice and further provides to take such affirmative action as will effectuate the policies of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.500" offset="2145907">This Court has often said that the choice of remedies for the correction of unfair labor practice, for the purpose of effectuating the statutory policies is primarily a matter for the Board's expert judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.047" offset="2196167">And then, unless the Board's judgment can reasonably be said not to effectuate the policy of the statute, unless its judging can be said to be arbitrary or capricious, a review in court should not normally disturb the Board's remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.517" offset="2258024">Now, one of the problems which has confronted the Board throughout its history has been the problem of how best to anticipate or neutralize the impact of an employer's domination or assistance of a -- of a labor organization upon the employees' freedom of choice in the selection of the bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.625" offset="2354469">Where the employer has dominated the labor organization, and it can be said that the employer's influence has so corrupted the labor organization as to make it incapable of ever been -- of ever being freely chosen by the employees as their bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.815" offset="2415177">The Board's normal remedy is to require the disestablishment of that union, disestablishment is the -- means that (Inaudible) never served as the representative of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.658" offset="2462616">But where the employer's conduct is something less than domination as in this case where it -- where it consists only of support --illegal assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.915" offset="2507651">The Board has chosen a less drastic remedy and the remedy of -- of disestablishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1665.112" offset="6660389">And certainly -- certainly this is contrary, we think, to the underlying scheme of Sections 9 (f), (g) and (h).</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.302" offset="6685153">And let me also emphasize, Your Honor, that the fact that this union is not in compliance, that the incidental effect of this order may be to require to comply with the -- with 9 (f), (g) and (h), and that that should not make any difference because as this Court has set in the Arkansas Flooring case, that while a noncomplying union may enjoy certain statutory benefit, for example, represent the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.478" offset="6773864">If it's freely chosen without a Board election, without Board certification, or without compliance to Section 9 (f), (g) and (h) nevertheless, this Court repeatedly emphasized in the Arkansas Flooring case that noncompliance does not serve to exempt the union from the sanctions of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1928.263" offset="7713019">May the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.662" offset="7726602">The time element and is into this case and that also answers the question asked by the Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.589" offset="7766309">The unfair labor practice committed in the first instance against the Teamsters Union was in November 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.979" offset="7807896">District 50 was not on the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.680" offset="7822629">The employer got a state court injunction to restrain violence and picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.809" offset="7859200">Then later that injunction was amended to permit peaceful picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.282" offset="7889084">It was six months, almost to the day from the time the man had committed -- that Bowman had committed unfair labor practice against the Teamsters when District 50 appeared on the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.078" offset="7948225">District 50 and no particular engaged in any unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.484" offset="7977900">Now the counsel for the Board is wrong in saying there's no provision of making it an unfair labor practice by a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.805" offset="8015203">If a union coerces a man in their choice, that's an unfair labor practice, I believe under Section of 8 (b) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.943" offset="8055745">So, we have a perfectly innocent union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.536" offset="8070060">Now, the Bowman president, suffering from Teamsters naturally wanted to get out of this situation he was in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.198" offset="8124709">District 50 was contacted by some Bowman employee and then they informed Mr. Bowman that they represented the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.062" offset="8180193">The Board seemed to think that when Mr. Bowman believed the representative of District 50, that he was wrong in believing that an honorable man was telling the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.943" offset="8239752">That he should have demanded then to see the cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.277" offset="8253022">He used a method of calling his man in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.011" offset="8267964">When the man came in the Regional Director of District 50 didn't want to go out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.793" offset="8299102">He wanted to have the man come to Gadsden, this all that happened at Gadsden.But the president said, there's a man in here, come out here and you can use my facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.005" offset="8348003">Now that was the extent of the support and assistance, letting them meet out there on his premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.814" offset="8391158">Now, the -- the confusion in the minds of the Board and of counsel for the Board, he confuses two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.236" offset="8436924">He confuses a Board conducted election with a Board certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.777" offset="8475063">There are cases, one happened as I recall in Alabama where a state agency conducts an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.951" offset="8511739">We have utilized the services of preachers and priests, and I believe of educators in supervising and checking and checking cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.543" offset="8558132">The certification has nothing whatsoever to do with expunging, to expunge means to eradicate from the mind of the laborer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.060" offset="8620199">Now, if they have an election, the election would be the indication of the laborers' state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.537" offset="8666070">The certification would come afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.058" offset="8684147">How can certification, after the effect has been eliminated and it's been demonstrated in an election by the men's own vote, how can certification have any part on the mind or any effect on the minds of those men who wanted District 50 in the first place?</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.675" offset="8774635">Now, this is not a question of domination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.567" offset="8786233">In fact, the coercion was evidently very small because the Board didn't agree with the trial examiner that that they had coerced the man in designing to check all cards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.873" offset="8847464">The Board disagreed with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.166" offset="8856660">It's simply a case that the Board failing to adapt itself to the changing world.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.032" offset="8904098">The Chief Justice discussed that before the University of Indiana in November.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.166" offset="8932624">The whole problem of the law is to adjust your rules to a changing world.</text>
