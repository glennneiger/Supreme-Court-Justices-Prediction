            <label>Mr. Roy L. Arterbury</label>
            <text syncTime="13.052" offset="52140">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.256" offset="61022">At recess time on yesterday, Chief Justice Warren had -- we had an excerpt from petitioner's brief and invited my observations on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.520" offset="110028">If it pleases the Court, before I do that, I want to preface that matter with reference to another bit of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.402" offset="177528">Mr. Justice Whittaker, as I remember asked counsel how this case could be maintained in this Court since the Beaumont Court of Civil Appeals had held that there was no agency question involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.122" offset="248477">That is that the Houston Belt and Terminal was not an agent of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.185" offset="280660">Unless there was a federal question involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.866" offset="299363">And then suggested that maybe the word -- the use for that word “agent” might raised the question and counsel immediately said, “Yes, that's how we got here.”</text>
            <text syncTime="87.516" offset="350041">It's a question of agency and referred to the Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.170" offset="368640">Now I wish Your Honors would turn if you will please to page 6 of the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.600" offset="418377">I make reference to the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.776" offset="447007">That it's very important that we see what it says and have all the light on it that we possibly get.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.970" offset="495804">It reads like this, “Every common carrier by railroad while engaging in commerce between any of the several states or territories shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce, for such injury or death resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such carrier.”</text>
            <text syncTime="158.527" offset="634044">Now you'll notice that the word “agents” there is sandwiched in between the word “officers” and “employees.”</text>
            <text syncTime="167.930" offset="671660">And necessarily it is calling to those other words.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.347" offset="701336">Now anyone who has been long associated with railroads and railroad work, control is familiar with the fact it had become almost common place to refer to certain employees of the railroad company as agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.173" offset="784614">The man who was in charge with the station is commonly known as the station agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.159" offset="808542">The man who sells tickets is the ticket agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.184" offset="824633">The man who operates the telegraph is the telegraph agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.374" offset="841456">We have the property agent, the freight agent, the ride-away agent, the maintenance of way agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.301" offset="877192">And so, some 10 to 12 or more classes of employees are commonly and convincingly referred to and designated as agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.316" offset="921182">And so that's exactly why the word “agent” here is sandwiched in between the word “officers” and “employees” who have wrote this article, was familiar with railroad wordings and the conventional calling of names and designations.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.524" offset="994011">Now, I'll ask the Court to look right across the page on page 7 where we quote from a case decided for this honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.800" offset="1035180">And this Court used this language in passing upon the employees and the interpretation of the meaning of the word “employees” I quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.769" offset="1087007">We have opinion that Congress, referring to this very Act, used the words “employee” and “employed” in the statute in the natural sense and intended to describe the convention -- conventional relation of employee and employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.739" offset="1174883">The conventional relationship meaning that this Act meant nothing else than the agents who are employees of such carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.988" offset="1235905">That's the only reason on that they used that word “agent” instead of just employees.</text>

            <text syncTime="370.462" offset="1481770">I mentioned yesterday the definition of the Court when they first filed this case of agency which was corrected the next time it's tried.</text>
