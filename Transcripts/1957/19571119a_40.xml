            <text syncTime="28.476" offset="113894">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.399" offset="125492">This case is here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of New Jersey, which held in a four-to-three decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.031" offset="152033">The petitioner's right to due process of law had not been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.864" offset="175438">The question is, whether it violates the sense of fundamental justice, to allow the State to dissect -- to dissect one criminal transaction into four premises for the purpose of retrying the same issue upon the same evidence which led to an acquittal 29 months before.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.735" offset="254851">The question of fundamental justice must be answered upon the facts of every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.648" offset="274495">The facts in this case are that on September 20th, 1950, there was a robbery of a tavern and all of the people in the tavern.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.575" offset="314201">In June of 1951, the Bergen County grand jury returned three indictments against petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.159" offset="344607">Each indictment alleged the petitioner in concert with two unknown persons had robbed the specified individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.814" offset="375223">The second count on the indictment charged carrying a concealed weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.294" offset="401136">These indictments were joined for trial and this was -- these indictments were tried in May of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.262" offset="433006">At that trial, the State called five witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.096" offset="448366">This group of witnesses included the three victims named in the indictments and two other victims of the holdup.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.006" offset="479922">Each of the five witnesses testified unequivocally and without contradiction, to the fact that he was put in fear and that as a result of that fear property was taken from this person.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.276" offset="525061">These are the elements of the crime of robbery under the applicable New Jersey statute, and these were the elements that were alleged in the indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.278" offset="561110">However, three of the witnesses for the State stated affirmatively that petitioner was not one of the robbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.191" offset="588696">A fourth witness where the State said, that he could identify under oath petitioner as one of the participants in the holdup.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.602" offset="622341">As a result of the five witnesses for the State, only one witness, Elmer Yager, affirmatively identified petitioner as one of the robbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.321" offset="669257">Petitioner testified as to alibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.995" offset="679915">He stated that he had never been in the town of Fairview in New Jersey where the robbery took place, that he did not participate in the robbery, and that he was in -- in New York City with his mother-in-law at the time of the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.947" offset="739788">Upon the basis of this evidence the jury acquitted on all three indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.100" offset="764343">Petitioner was returned to New York for incarceration, and in July of 1952, the Bergen County grand jury returned another indictment against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.717" offset="806766">This indictment was the same in all respect for the first three except that Elmer Yager was named as the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.329" offset="837277">Elmer Yager was the witness who had identified him in the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.415" offset="857652">In May of 1954, petitioner was returned to New Jersey, placed in the Bergen County jail where he remained until October 18th and 19th, 1954 when he was finally brought to trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="315.588" offset="1262341">At -- at this trial, the jury convicted petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.331" offset="1289300">The State in attempting to sustain this second trial attempts to formulate other hypothesis for the first verdict other than the fact -- lack of identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.506" offset="1337992">Petitioner contends that the only reasonable interpretation of the first verdict was that the first jury found that petitioner was not one of the robbers or at least that they found, that they had not proved him to be a participant in the holdup.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.893" offset="1395566">We contend this for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.883" offset="1407478">In the first place, the State admits that the only issue in the first trial was the question of identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.433" offset="1433704">They admitted that before the New Jersey Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.845" offset="1443318">They admitted in their counterstatement of facts in their -- in their brief in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.638" offset="1466514">Also, the facts of the robbery, the elements of the robbery have been conclusively shown by five witnesses and were not contradicted and were not disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.531" offset="1506116">The question of identification has been raised by four out of the five State witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.598" offset="1526387">Finally, the only issue that could have been common and conclusive upon all three indictments was the question of whether petitioner was one of the robbers and the jury acquitted upon all three.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.231" offset="1576856">The State, in page 13, of their brief gave alternative hypothesis and I would like to spend a moment or two of mentioning them.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.551" offset="1610188">In the first place they say, that the jury might not have believed Mr. Cascio, Mr. Capezzuto and Mr Galiardo, the named victims, when they said that they were put in fear and had been robbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.594" offset="1666299">This -- this wouldn't require that the jury in relation to the three indictments disbelieve each one of these individuals upon testimony which was not contradicted and which was unequivocal, and testimony which was buttressed by the testimony of two additional witnesses as to the fact of the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.215" offset="1740800">They attempt to go further and say that maybe they didn't believe him because of the retraction of a prior identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.736" offset="1778939">This statement is based upon an erroneous defunction of fact according to their counterstatement of facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="462.797" offset="1851141">It is one of the petitioner's contentions that one -- that there are three reasons why that violates the fundamental justice to allow the State to re-litigate the fact upon the same evidence which has lead to an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.238" offset="1916865">Those reasons are -- that it is -- that the prohibition is uniformly accepted, I have been unable to find a case in which the Court has faced the problem and held that they said re-litigate the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.493" offset="1973917">Second reason which I would like to expound later on is that according to Palko against Connecticut and Brock against North Carolina, the Due Process Clause protects the fundamental policies underlying the Double Jeopardy provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.173" offset="2040686">It is one of my contentions that there are at least three types of cases in the Double Jeopardy case which show that the prevention of the re-litigation of the same fact is the fundamental policy of the Double Jeopardy provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.356" offset="2093349">And finally, I believe that if the State can re-litigate the same fact upon the same issue, it undermined many of our most cherished safeguards in relation to an Anglo -- of our Anglo- American adversarial system of trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="728.229" offset="2912862">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.638" offset="2922475">In answer to Mr. Justice Frankfurter's question, I think that the significant thing, of course, is that the issue at the first trial was the issue of my (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="744.419" offset="2977646">As I stated previously, this Court in the unanimous opinion, United States against Sealfon held that the Federal Government could not re-litigate an issue which has been previously decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.421" offset="3041593">There are three ways, I think, of showing that this rule is a rule of fundamental justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.866" offset="3067402">As previously stated, I think that it is uniformly accepted as true both in civil and criminal matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.556" offset="3098122">Secondly, I think that it is an underlying policy of the Double Jeopardy provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.336" offset="3125290">I think that both Palko against Connecticut and Brock against North Carolina assumed that the basic policies of the Double Jeopardy provisions are protected by the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.944" offset="3175758">As stated by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in his concurring opinion in the Brock case, the State falls short of its obligation if it -- if it attempts to retry an individual upon a charge for which he had been acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.351" offset="3237303">There are three types of cases where this is significant or has been demonstrated to be one of the underlying policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.276" offset="3273038">For instance, a man cannot be tried for murder after having been acquitted of manslaughter of the same individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.127" offset="3308460">This was held in the case of U.S. against Graf.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.427" offset="3325701">The test that was approved by the Supreme Court and by Mr Justice Harlan who wrote the opinions of the Supreme Court was whether the first verdict negative to facts in the second charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.425" offset="3381603">This test gives emphasis to the fact that the first verdict was an acquittal, not a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.808" offset="3411174">Because on a lesser and included offense, the first verdict would do nothing more than affirm some of the facts in the second charge if it were a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.251" offset="3448999">This test also, I believe, emphasizes the danger of inconsistent verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.494" offset="3477943">The same evidence test is applied by Mr. Justice (Inaudible) for the majority in the Supreme Court of New Jersey would allow a re-litigation except where the evidence necessary to sustain a conviction under the second indictment, would have precluded the conviction under the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.046" offset="3556101">He reasoned further that since the victims were different, there could be no double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.914" offset="3587553">This gives undue emphasis to the identity of the victims which were not an issue at the -- at the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.377" offset="3613466">The same maybe said for his rule in relation to collateral estoppels.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.086" offset="3636245">Whatever necessity there was in the past for the application of abstract logic to this proposition or this problem, that necessity does not exist today.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.164" offset="3688594">Today transcripts are kept of every trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.550" offset="3702178">Complete transcripts.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.653" offset="3706567">And a study of the transcript can demonstrate what the issues were at the first litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.338" offset="3733316">The second type of case where the principle against re-litigation of the same issue has been demonstrated are the cases involving state appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.837" offset="3775321">In the State of Wisconsin there's a statute which allows the state appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.854" offset="3791412">However, in State against Agnew it was held that the State could not appeal a determination of the trier of fact absent legal heir.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.092" offset="3832268">And the reason the Court gave for that holding was, that to allow such a -- an appeal would be to successfully undermine the policies behind their double jeopardy provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.283" offset="3885035">The third group of cases, I think, that -- that demonstrate this principle go much further than the petitioner's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.785" offset="3907082">Those are the abortive trial cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.643" offset="3918472">The rule is almost uniformly accepted that a State may not terminate the proceedings prior to verdict, and then try the defendant over again unless determination was absolutely necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.607" offset="3978344">The reason for this has been given as a fear that the prosecution sensing that the first -- the first jury was hostile, would attempt to terminate the proceeding prior to the verdict, so that they could try the same issue in front of another jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.332" offset="4045322">In the light of these three areas of double jeopardy, I believe that the prohibition against re-litigation of the same issue is a fundamental policy of the Double Jeopardy provisions and therefore protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.713" offset="4118779">Finally, I think that to allow re-litigation of the same issue upon the same evidence is to undermine any for the basic safeguards of our adversary system of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.676" offset="4174681">The State before it can incarcerate a man and deprive him of liberty has to prove that this man is guilty with a high degree of probability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.134" offset="4212506">This has been incorporated into the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which has been held to be requirement of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.393" offset="4257541">Yet looking at this record today, no man can say whether or not Mr. Hoag was one of the robbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.292" offset="4289097">On the issue of whether he was one, the first jury acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.937" offset="4307696">The second jury convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.722" offset="4314802">This does not refute Mr. Hoag's continuing claim of innocence with anywhere near the sufficient or requisite degree of certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.453" offset="4357747">One of the most basic safeguards of our system and one of the greatest safeguards that we have against erroneous conviction is the right to a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.646" offset="4390557">This has been held to be due process in a great number of types of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.373" offset="4413440">Yet, unless the verdict is given its broadest significance so that the State may not re-litigate the same issue, the concept of a fair trial loses its validity as a -- a safeguard against erroneous conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.439" offset="4493688">It does for the very simple reason that if the State can retry the same issue on the same evidence to successive jury even though the trials be fair, eventual conviction is a normal certainty regardless of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.905" offset="4559517">The same can be said about a jury trial which was described by this Court recently as one of the greatest bulwarks against governmental arbitraries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.794" offset="4595148">It does a man little good to have a right to a jury trial with the same issue to be submitted to a successive jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.870" offset="4623464">Sooner or later, a jury will be found which will convict regardless of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.499" offset="4645930">Another aggravating factor in this case was the fact that the State's knowing refusal to indict for Mr. Yager's robbery until after the first acquittal caused the 29-month delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.352" offset="4693368">Mr. Yager had filed a statement with the police the day of the robbery so the Government knew, the State knew from the time of the robbery that he purported to be a victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.275" offset="4728999">Today it attempts to overcome this aggravation by stating that Mr. Hoag was in New York, incarcerated in New York and they couldn't bring him to trial sooner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.749" offset="4774975">This overlooks the fact that they knew from the day of the robbery that Mr. Yager was the victim and that they did not indict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.861" offset="4799425">This overlooks the fact that they did have jurisdiction of Mr. Hoag the day and at the time of the first trial which was the ideal time to settle all of the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.328" offset="4853238">Secondly, they say that it is not prejudicial to the defendant even though his mother-in-law died between the first and second trial, and petitioner can testify that he had been in New York City that he -- with his mother-in-law at the time of the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.583" offset="4910289">They say that the failure of the first trial contemplates in the context to the fact than present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.224" offset="4944875">The failure to call the mother-in-law at that trial, under those circumstances, shows that she would not have been helpful to the petitioner in the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.908" offset="4983536">The State having caused this delay by their own knowing action are in a particularly poor position and speculated to what the prejudice might have been to Mr. Hoag.</text>

            <text syncTime="1329.900" offset="5319576">The State of New Jersey opposes the petitioner's claim of the safeguarding and his double jeopardy under the benefits of res judicata or collateral estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.090" offset="5368268">The issue is whether under the facts a state court judgment of conviction amounts to a denial of due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.331" offset="5421244">No case in this Court directly or by necessary implication compels that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.353" offset="5453322">No case in this Court that maybe fairly stated even suggests that result under these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.721" offset="5486864">The Palko case and the Brock case may stand for the proposition although my brother from Illinois disputes this that the protection against double jeopardy is a fundamental right safeguarded by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.749" offset="5550916">This is not a double jeopardy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.476" offset="5565858">The Constitution of New Jersey as well as the Fifth Amendment bar a retrial after acquittal for the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.154" offset="5612565">William Hoag was -- was tried and acquitted of the crime of robbing one Cascio, one Capezzuto, and one Galiardo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.541" offset="5658122">He was then tried and convicted for the crime of robbing Elmer Yager separate crimes occurring at the same time, the same place as part of the tavern holdup, but each crime requiring proof of the elements of a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.404" offset="5741610">That is, putting in fear each of the victims, taking personal property forcibly from each of the victims, and a criminal intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.855" offset="5795318">New Jersey in the -- in the Superior Court Appellate Division and then the Supreme Court applied the recognized common law test for double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.502" offset="5841920">And they found that a retrial and a conviction were not barred under those recognized tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.664" offset="5866580">Those are that same evidence tests and the single act test.</text>

            <text syncTime="2703.934" offset="10815634">And by established law of conspiracy to commit the offense and the substantive offense itself were separate and independent offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.516" offset="10862028">Mr. Justice Douglas -- analyzing the -- the record in the two trials found that the -- that the only proof, the only evidence upon which the defendant could have been convicted at either trial was the evidence of the writing of a letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.879" offset="10955442">Now the letter is something to the effect that some of -- some of the syrups manufactured by or some of the syrups in which Sealfon dealt were being sold to the Brooklyn Navy Yard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2773.074" offset="11092219">And there because there was an identity that the -- the substantive act asserted as a criminal act and both charges was identically the same and the proof had been before the first jury and the first jury had acquitted, this Court ruled that a second -- that a conviction on the substantive offense had to be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.788" offset="11199112">That it was contrary to due process of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2922.079" offset="11688229">But certainly, the -- the regularity and -- and lack of malice of the State should not be questioned unless there is some affirmative showing and there is no such affirmative showing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.898" offset="11747579">Now, as to the -- as to the danger of an erroneous conviction although this defendant pleaded not guilty, he has never attacked the fairness of the second trial as such or the validity of that conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.137" offset="11816542">There is no plea in New Jersey of collateral estoppel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3010.310" offset="12041195">Certainly if this Court should reverse here -- it restricts the prosecutor in many cases where there is a transaction involving -- involving multiple crimes against several people and one or more of the complaining witnesses are not available at the time of the -- of the first trial or as the -- as the case is ready for the first trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3054.234" offset="12216842">Any -- any reading of the -- of the transfers of the two trials of William Hoag will lead to the conclusion certainly that -- that Elmer Yager had -- had a more detailed recollection of the events.</text>

            <text syncTime="3113.175" offset="12452676">As -- as an additional point, the petitioner Hoag has -- has raised the -- the lack of a speedy trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3285.438" offset="13141682">And this is demonstrated in a number of ways, one of which is that the first trial, the only identification was Mr. Yager's identification.</text>

            <text syncTime="3303.150" offset="13212526">In relation to the problem of harassment under Palko against Connecticut, I'd like to point out that under the theory of the test of offense as used by the majority in New Jersey, there is no difference or there could have been four trials here and in logic there is no difference between two and four trials on the same issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3362.895" offset="13451494">In this case there is no new evidence on the only disputed issue for insofar as the phrase collateral estoppel would preclude re-litigation on the same issue with new evidence this case did not go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.381" offset="13501440">But I would like to point out that the term “offense” in the Double Jeopardy provision is the technical term that can be expanded and contracted and that Mr. Kirchheimer in the Yale Law Journal points up this term the act-offense dichotomy threatens to undermine the basic policy through the Double Jeopardy provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.156" offset="13596526">If you -- if you define offense narrowly enough and the -- the test used by the New Jersey courts in this case was described by the American Law Institute as being the outstanding example of all the tests today are so narrow that they fail to afford the defendant, any appreciable safeguard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.651" offset="13674580">If you use the term offense in that nature, certainly some auxillary method is necessary to preclude re-litigation on the same side and upon the same evidence.</text>
